v1.3.1
  Version 1.3.1

  Quick release for a fix around aliasing in v1.3.

v1.3
  Version 1.3

  Add support for the Google Application Default Credentials.
  Require python 2.6 as a minimum version.
  Update several API samples.
  Finish splitting out oauth2client repo and update tests.
  Various doc cleanup and bugfixes.

  Two important notes:
    * We've added `googleapiclient` as the primary suggested import
      name, and kept `apiclient` as an alias, in order to have a more
      appropriate import name. At some point, we will remove `apiclient`
      as an alias.
    * Due to an issue around in-place upgrades for Python packages,
      it's not possible to do an upgrade from version 1.2 to 1.3. Instead,
      setup.py attempts to detect this and prevents it. Simply remove
      the previous version and reinstall to fix this.

v1.2
  Version 1.2

  The use of the gflags library is now deprecated, and is no longer a
    dependency. If you are still using the oauth2client.tools.run() function
    then include gflags as a dependency of your application or switch to
    oauth2client.tools.run_flow.
  Samples have been updated to use the new apiclient.sample_tools, and no
    longer use gflags.
  Added support for the experimental Object Change Notification, as found in
    the Cloud Storage API.
  The oauth2client App Engine decorators are now threadsafe.

  - Use the following redirects feature of httplib2 where it returns the
    ultimate URL after a series of redirects to avoid multiple hops for every
    resumable media upload request.
  - Updated AdSense Management API samples to V1.3
  - Add option to automatically retry requests.
  - Ability to list registered keys in multistore_file.
  - User-agent must contain (gzip).
  - The 'method' parameter for httplib2 is not positional. This would cause
    spurious warnings in the logging.
  - Making OAuth2Decorator more extensible. Fixes Issue 256.
  - Update AdExchange Buyer API examples to version v1.2.


v1.1
  Version 1.1

  Add PEM support to SignedJWTAssertionCredentials (used to only support
  PKCS12 formatted keys). Note that if you use PEM formatted keys you can use
  PyCrypto 2.6 or later instead of OpenSSL.

  Allow deserialized discovery docs to be passed to build_from_document().

  - Make ResumableUploadError derive from HttpError.
  - Many changes to move all the closures in apiclient.discovery into real
  -  classes and objects.

    using an arbitrary key.

v1.0beta8
 - Updated meda upload support.
 - Many fixes for batch requests.
 - Better handling for requests that don't require a body.
 - Fix issues with Google App Engine Python 2.7 runtime.
 - Better support for proxies.
 - All Storages now have a .delete() method.
 - Important changes which might break your code:
    * apiclient.anyjson has moved to oauth2client.anyjson.
    * Some calls, for example, taskqueue().lease() used to require a parameter
      named body. In this new release only methods that really need to send a body
      require a body parameter, and so you may get errors about an unknown
      'body' parameter in your call. The solution is to remove the unneeded
      body={} parameter.

v1.0beta7
