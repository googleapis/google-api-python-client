v1.6.4
  Version 1.6.4

  Bugfix release

  - Warn when google-auth credentials are used but google-auth-httplib2 isn't available. (#443)

v1.6.3
  Version 1.6.3

  Bugfix release

  - Add notification of maintenance mode to README. (#410)
  - Fix generation of methods with abnormal page token conventions. (#338)
  - Raise ValueError is credentials and developerKey are both specified. (#358)
  - Re-generate documentation. (#364, #373, #401)

v1.6.2
  Version 1.6.2

  Bugfix release

  - Fixed a bug where application default credentials would still be used even
    when a developerKey was specified. (#347)
  - Official support for Python 3.5 and 3.6. (#341)
 
v1.6.1
  Version 1.6.1

  Bugfix release

  - Fixed a bug where using google-auth with scoped credentials would fail. (#328)

v1.6.0
  Version 1.6.0

  Release to drop support for Python 2.6 and add support for google-auth.

  - Support for Python 2.6 has been dropped. (#319)
  - The credentials argument to discovery.build and discovery.build_from_document
    can be either oauth2client credentials or google-auth credentials. (#319)
  - discovery.build and discovery.build_from_document now unambiguously use the
    http argument to make all requests, including the request for the discovery
    document. (#319)
  - The http and credentials arguments to discovery.build and
    discovery.build_from_document are now mutually exclusive, eliminating a
    buggy edge case. (#319)
  - If neither http or credentials is specified to discovery.build and
    discovery.build_from_document, then Application Default Credentials will
    be used. The library prefers google-auth for this if it is available, but
    can also use oauth2client's implementation. (#319)
  - Fixed resumable upload failure when receiving a 308 response. (#312)
  - Clarified the support versions of Python 3. (#316)

  - Fix project_id argument description. (#257)
  - Retry chunk uploaded on rate limit exceeded errors. (#255)

  Add automatic caching for the discovery docs.

v1.4.1
  Version 1.4.1

  Add the googleapiclient.discovery.Resource.new_batch_http_request method.

  - Fix a unicode error in error encoding.
  - Better handling of `content-length` in media requests.
  - Add support for methodPath entries containing colon.

v1.3.1
  Version 1.3.1

  Quick release for a fix around aliasing in v1.3.

v1.3
  Version 1.3

  Add support for the Google Application Default Credentials.
  Require python 2.6 as a minimum version.
  Update several API samples.
  Finish splitting out oauth2client repo and update tests.
  Various doc cleanup and bugfixes.

  Two important notes:
    * We've added `googleapiclient` as the primary suggested import
      name, and kept `apiclient` as an alias, in order to have a more
      appropriate import name. At some point, we will remove `apiclient`
      as an alias.
    * Due to an issue around in-place upgrades for Python packages,
      it's not possible to do an upgrade from version 1.2 to 1.3. Instead,
      setup.py attempts to detect this and prevents it. Simply remove
      the previous version and reinstall to fix this.

v1.2
  Version 1.2

  The use of the gflags library is now deprecated, and is no longer a
    dependency. If you are still using the oauth2client.tools.run() function
    then include gflags as a dependency of your application or switch to
    oauth2client.tools.run_flow.
  Samples have been updated to use the new apiclient.sample_tools, and no
    longer use gflags.
  Added support for the experimental Object Change Notification, as found in
    the Cloud Storage API.
  The oauth2client App Engine decorators are now threadsafe.

  - Use the following redirects feature of httplib2 where it returns the
    ultimate URL after a series of redirects to avoid multiple hops for every
    resumable media upload request.
  - Updated AdSense Management API samples to V1.3
  - Add option to automatically retry requests.
  - Ability to list registered keys in multistore_file.
  - User-agent must contain (gzip).
  - The 'method' parameter for httplib2 is not positional. This would cause
    spurious warnings in the logging.
  - Making OAuth2Decorator more extensible. Fixes Issue 256.
  - Update AdExchange Buyer API examples to version v1.2.


v1.1
  Version 1.1

  Add PEM support to SignedJWTAssertionCredentials (used to only support
  PKCS12 formatted keys). Note that if you use PEM formatted keys you can use
  PyCrypto 2.6 or later instead of OpenSSL.

  Allow deserialized discovery docs to be passed to build_from_document().

  - Make ResumableUploadError derive from HttpError.
  - Many changes to move all the closures in apiclient.discovery into real
  -  classes and objects.

    using an arbitrary key.
  - Don't accept 403 challenges by default for auth challenges.
  - Set httplib2.RETRIES to 1.
  - Consolidate handling of scopes.
  - Upgrade to httplib2 version 0.8.
  - Allow setting the response_type in OAuth2WebServerFlow.
  - Ensure that dataWrapper feature is checked before using the 'data' value.
  - HMAC verification does not use a constant time algorithm.

     http://google-api-python-client.googlecode.com/hg/docs/epy/index.html
 - Many improvements for media support:
   * Added media download support, including resumable downloads.
   * Better handling of streams that report their size as 0.
   * Update Media Upload to include io.Base and also fix some bugs.

v1.0beta8
 - Updated meda upload support.
 - Many fixes for batch requests.
 - Better handling for requests that don't require a body.
 - Fix issues with Google App Engine Python 2.7 runtime.
 - Better support for proxies.
 - All Storages now have a .delete() method.
 - Important changes which might break your code:
    * apiclient.anyjson has moved to oauth2client.anyjson.
    * Some calls, for example, taskqueue().lease() used to require a parameter
      named body. In this new release only methods that really need to send a body
      require a body parameter, and so you may get errors about an unknown
      'body' parameter in your call. The solution is to remove the unneeded
      body={} parameter.

v1.0beta7
