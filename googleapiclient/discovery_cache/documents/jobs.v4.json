The expired job can't be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time.

After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can't be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn't exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last update time.

In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).",
