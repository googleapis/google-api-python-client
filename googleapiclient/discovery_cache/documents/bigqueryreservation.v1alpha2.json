Same logic applies if the request is about a folder. If the request is about an organization, then grants created on the organization will be returned (organization doesn't have ancestors). Comparing to ListReservationGrants, there are two behavior differences: 1) permission on the grantee will be verified in this API. 2) Hierarchy lookup (project-\u003efolder-\u003eorganization) happens in this API.",
