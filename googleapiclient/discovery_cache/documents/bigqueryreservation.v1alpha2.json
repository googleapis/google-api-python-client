If the request is about a project: 1) Grants created on the project will be returned if they exist. 2) Otherwise grants created on the closest ancestor will be returned. 3) Grants for different JobTypes will all be returned. Same logic applies if the request is about a folder. If the request is about an organization, then grants created on the organization will be returned (organization doesn't have ancestors). Comparing to ListReservationGrants, there are two behavior differences: 1) permission on the grantee will be verified in this API. 2) Hierarchy lookup (project-\u003efolder-\u003eorganization) happens in this API.",
