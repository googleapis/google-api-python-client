      "description": "Represents a variable or an argument possibly of a compound object type. Note how the following variables are represented: 1) A simple variable: int x = 5 { name: \"x\", value: \"5\", type: \"int\" } // Captured variable 2) A compound object: struct T { int m1; int m2; }; T x = { 3, 7 }; { // Captured variable name: \"x\", type: \"T\", members { name: \"m1\", value: \"3\", type: \"int\" }, members { name: \"m2\", value: \"7\", type: \"int\" } } 3) A pointer where the pointee was captured: T x = { 3, 7 }; T* p = &x; { // Captured variable name: \"p\", type: \"T*\", value: \"0x00500500\", members { name: \"m1\", value: \"3\", type: \"int\" }, members { name: \"m2\", value: \"7\", type: \"int\" } } 4) A pointer where the pointee was not captured: T* p = new T; { // Captured variable name: \"p\", type: \"T*\", value: \"0x00400400\" status { is_error: true, description { format: \"unavailable\" } } } The status should describe the reason for the missing value, such as ``, ``, ``. Note that a null pointer should not have members. 5) An unnamed value: int* p = new int(7); { // Captured variable name: \"p\", value: \"0x00500500\", type: \"int*\", members { value: \"7\", type: \"int\" } } 6) An unnamed pointer where the pointee was not captured: int* p = new int(7); int** pp = &p; { // Captured variable name: \"pp\", value: \"0x00500500\", type: \"int**\", members { value: \"0x00400400\", type: \"int*\" status { is_error: true, description: { format: \"unavailable\" } } } } } To optimize computation, memory and network traffic, variables that repeat in the output multiple times can be stored once in a shared variable table and be referenced using the `var_table_index` field. The variables stored in the shared table are nameless and are essentially a partition of the complete variable. To reconstruct the complete variable, merge the referencing variable with the referenced variable. When using the shared variable table, the following variables: T x = { 3, 7 }; T* p = &x; T& r = x; { name: \"x\", var_table_index: 3, type: \"T\" } // Captured variables { name: \"p\", value \"0x00500500\", type=\"T*\", var_table_index: 3 } { name: \"r\", type=\"T&\", var_table_index: 3 } { // Shared variable table entry #3: members { name: \"m1\", value: \"3\", type: \"int\" }, members { name: \"m2\", value: \"7\", type: \"int\" } } Note that the pointer address is stored with the referencing variable and not with the referenced variable.
