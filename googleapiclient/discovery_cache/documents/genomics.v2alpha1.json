For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

The : operator can be used to determine if a particular event has occurred. * error: If the pipeline is running, this value is NULL. Once the pipeline finishes, the value is the standard Google error code. * labels.key or labels.\"key with space\" where key is a label key. * done: If the pipeline is running, this value is false.

Corresponds to OperationMetadata.projectId. * createTime: The time this job was created, in seconds from the [epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). Can use `\u003e=` and/or `\u003c=` operators. * status: Can be `RUNNING`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `CANCELED`. Only one status may be specified. * labels.key where key is a label key.
