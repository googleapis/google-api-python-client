We don't provide any way to change record delimiters. While the input files are being processed, we write/update an index file 'index.csv' under 'output_uri_prefix' (for example, gs://translation-test/index.csv) The index file is generated/updated as new files are being translated. The format is: input_file,target_language_code,translations_file,errors_file, glossary_translations_file,glossary_errors_file input_file is one file we matched using gcs_source.input_uri. target_language_code is provided in the request. translations_file contains the translations. (details provided below) errors_file contains the errors during processing of the file. (details below). Both translations_file and errors_file could be empty strings if we have no content to output. glossary_translations_file and glossary_errors_file are always empty strings if the input_file is tsv. They could also be empty if we have no content to output. Once a row is present in index.csv, the input/output matching never changes. Callers should also expect all the content in input_file are processed and ready to be consumed (that is, no partial output file is written). Since index.csv will be keeping updated during the process, please make sure there is no custom retention policy applied on the output bucket that may avoid file updating. (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-lock?hl=en#retention-policy) The format of translations_file (for target language code 'trg') is: gs://translation_test/a_b_c_'trg'_translations.[extension] If the input file extension is tsv, the output has the following columns: Column 1: ID of the request provided in the input, if it's not provided in the input, then the input row number is used (0-based). Column 2: source sentence. Column 3: translation without applying a glossary. Empty string if there is an error. Column 4 (only present if a glossary is provided in the request): translation after applying the glossary. Empty string if there is an error applying the glossary. Could be same string as column 3 if there is no glossary applied. If input file extension is a txt or html, the translation is directly written to the output file.

Column 2: source sentence. Column 3: Error detail for the translation. Could be empty. Column 4 (only present if a glossary is provided in the request): Error when applying the glossary.
