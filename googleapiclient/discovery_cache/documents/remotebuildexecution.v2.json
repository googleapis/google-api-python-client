The server MAY enforce the requirements and return errors if a non-canonical input is received. It MAY also proceed without verifying some or all of the requirements, such as for performance reasons.

The operation can also be queried using Operations API. The server NEED NOT implement other methods or functionality of the Operations API. Errors discovered during creation of the `Operation` will be reported as gRPC Status errors, while errors that occurred while running the action will be reported in the `status` field of the `ExecuteResponse`. The server MUST NOT set the `error` field of the `Operation` proto.

The client should retry. * `INTERNAL`: An internal error occurred in the execution engine or the worker. * `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The execution timed out. * `CANCELLED`: The operation was cancelled by the client. This status is only possible if the server implements the Operations API CancelOperation method, and it was called for the current execution.

Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory. In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a a `Directory`: * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment. Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed. * Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name). Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is legal to call the API with a Directory that has both \"Foo\" and \"foo\" as children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon execution. * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes. * The NodeProperties of files, directories, and symlinks must be sorted in lexicographical order by property name. A `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form. As an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened for readability): ```json // (Directory proto) { files: [ { name: \"bar\", digest: { hash: \"4a73bc9d03...\", size: 65534 }, node_properties: [ { \"name\": \"MTime\", \"value\": \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" } ] } ], directories: [ { name: \"foo\", digest: { hash: \"4cf2eda940...\", size: 43 } } ] } // (Directory proto with hash \"4cf2eda940...\" and size 43) { files: [ { name: \"baz\", digest: { hash: \"b2c941073e...\", size: 1294, }, is_executable: true } ] } ```",

The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request. The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff. When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message: * Fields are serialized in tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type. Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance, concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.",
