# Library maintenance
This client library is supported but in maintenance mode only.  We are fixing necessary bugs and adding essential features to ensure this library continues to meet your needs for accessing Google APIs.  Non-critical issues will be closed.  Any issue may be reopened if it is causing ongoing problems.

# About
This is the Python client library for Google's discovery based APIs. To get started, please see the [full documentation for this library](http://google.github.io/google-api-python-client). Additionally, [dynamically generated documentation](http://api-python-client-doc.appspot.com/) is available for all of the APIs supported by this library.

## Google Cloud Platform APIs
If you're working with **Google Cloud Platform** APIs such as Datastore or Pub/Sub, consider using the [Cloud Client Libraries for Python](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-python) instead. These are the new and idiomatic Python libraries targeted specifically at Google Cloud Platform Services.

# Installation
To install, simply use `pip` or `easy_install`:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
```
or
```bash
$ easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client
```

See the [Developers Guide](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/get_started) for more detailed instructions and additional documentation.

# Python Version
Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 are fully supported and tested. This library may work on later versions of 3, but we do not currently run tests against those versions.
