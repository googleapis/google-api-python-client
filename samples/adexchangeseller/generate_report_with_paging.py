"""This example retrieves a report for the specified ad client.

Please only use pagination if your application requires it due to memory or
storage constraints.
If you need to retrieve more than 5000 rows, please check generate_report.py, as
due to current limitations you will not be able to use paging for large reports.
To get ad clients, run get_all_ad_clients.py.
