    The list method of the resource should be called with the "crowdBy"
    parameter.  Each parameter should be designed as <attribute>:<occurence>,
    where <occurrence> is the number of that <attribute> that will be used. For
    example, to crowd by the 5 top brands, the parameter would be "brand:5". The
    possible rules for crowding are currently:

    account_id:<occurrence> (eg account_id:5)
    brand:<occurrence> (eg brand:5)
    condition:<occurrence> (eg condition:3)
    gtin:<occurrence> (eg gtin:10)
    price:<occurrence> (eg price:10)

    Multiple crowding rules should be specified by separating them with a comma,
    for example to crowd by the top 5 brands and then condition of those items,
    the parameter should be crowdBy="brand:5,condition:3"
