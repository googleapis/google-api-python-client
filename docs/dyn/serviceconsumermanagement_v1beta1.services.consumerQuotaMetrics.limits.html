<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a summary of quota information for a specific quota limit.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the quota limit, returned by a
ListConsumerQuotaMetrics or GetConsumerQuotaMetric call.

An example name would be:
`services/compute.googleapis.com/projects/123/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion` (required)
  view: string, Specifies the level of detail for quota information in the response.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Consumer quota settings for a quota limit.
    &quot;isPrecise&quot;: True or False, # Whether this limit is precise or imprecise.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the quota limit.
