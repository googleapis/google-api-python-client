<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all Sessions by their parent DataStore.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The data store resource name. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection}/dataStores/{data_store_id}` (required)
  filter: string, A comma-separated list of fields to filter by, in EBNF grammar. The supported fields are: * `user_pseudo_id` * `state` * `display_name` * `starred` * `is_pinned` * `labels` * `create_time` * `update_time` Examples: * `user_pseudo_id = some_id` * `display_name = &quot;some_name&quot;` * `starred = true` * `is_pinned=true AND (NOT labels:hidden)` * `create_time &gt; &quot;1970-01-01T12:00:00Z&quot;`
  orderBy: string, A comma-separated list of fields to order by, sorted in ascending order. Use &quot;desc&quot; after a field name for descending. Supported fields: * `update_time` * `create_time` * `session_name` * `is_pinned` Example: * `update_time desc` * `create_time` * `is_pinned desc,update_time desc`: list sessions by is_pinned first, then by update_time.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of results to return. If unspecified, defaults to 50. Max allowed value is 1000.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListSessions` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
