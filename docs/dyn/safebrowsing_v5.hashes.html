  <pre>Search for full hashes matching the specified prefixes. This is a custom method as defined by https://google.aip.dev/136 (the custom method refers to this method having a custom name within Google&#x27;s general API development nomenclature; it does not refer to using a custom HTTP method).

Args:
  hashPrefixes: string, Required. The hash prefixes to be looked up. Clients MUST NOT send more than 1000 hash prefixes. However, following the URL processing procedure, clients SHOULD NOT need to send more than 30 hash prefixes. Currently each hash prefix is required to be exactly 4 bytes long. This MAY be relaxed in the future. (repeated)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response returned after searching threat hashes. If nothing is found, the server will return an OK status (HTTP status code 200) with the `full_hashes` field empty, rather than returning a NOT_FOUND status (HTTP status code 404). **What&#x27;s new in V5**: There is a separation between FullHash and FullHashDetail. In the case when a hash represents a site having multiple threats (e.g. both MALWARE and SOCIAL_ENGINEERING), the full hash does not need to be sent twice as in V4. Furthermore, the cache duration has been simplified into a single `cache_duration` field.
  &quot;cacheDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The client-side cache duration. The client MUST add this duration to the current time to determine the expiration time. The expiration time then applies to every hash prefix queried by the client in the request, regardless of how many full hashes are returned in the response. Even if the server returns no full hashes for a particular hash prefix, this fact MUST also be cached by the client. Important: the client MUST NOT assume that the server will return the same cache duration for all responses. The server MAY choose different cache durations for different responses depending on the situation.
  &quot;fullHashes&quot;: [ # Unordered list. The unordered list of full hashes found.
    { # The full hash identified with one or more matches.
      &quot;fullHash&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The matching full hash. This is the SHA256 hash. The length will be exactly 32 bytes.
      &quot;fullHashDetails&quot;: [ # Unordered list. A repeated field identifying the details relevant to this full hash.
        { # Details about a matching full hash. An important note about forward compatibility: new threat types and threat attributes may be added by the server at any time; those additions are considered minor version changes. It is Google&#x27;s policy not to expose minor version numbers in APIs (see https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/versioning for the versioning policy), so clients MUST be prepared to receive `FullHashDetail` messages containing `ThreatType` enum values or `ThreatAttribute` enum values that are considered invalid by the client. Therefore, it is the client&#x27;s responsibility to check for the validity of all `ThreatType` and `ThreatAttribute` enum values; if any value is considered invalid, the client MUST disregard the entire `FullHashDetail` message.
          &quot;attributes&quot;: [ # Unordered list. Additional attributes about those full hashes. This may be empty.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;threatType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of threat. This field will never be empty.
        },
      ],
