<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addSignedUrlKey">addSignedUrlKey(project, backendBucket, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds a key for validating requests with signed URLs for this backend bucket.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  backendBucket: string, Name of the BackendBucket resource to which the Signed URL Key should be added. The name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a customer-supplied Signing Key used by Cloud CDN Signed URLs
    "keyName": "A String", # Name of the key. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
    "keyValue": "A String", # 128-bit key value used for signing the URL. The key value must be a valid RFC 4648 Section 5 base64url encoded string.
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.
      #
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups, Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions defined by IAM.
      #
      # **JSON Example**
      #
      # { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/owner", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/viewer", "members": ["user:sean@example.com"] } ] }

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="insert">insert(project, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a BackendBucket resource in the specified project using the data included in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A BackendBucket resource. This resource defines a Cloud Storage bucket.
    "kind": "compute#backendBucket", # Type of the resource.
    "description": "A String", # An optional textual description of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
    "cdnPolicy": { # Message containing Cloud CDN configuration for a backend bucket. # Cloud CDN configuration for this BackendBucket.
      "signedUrlKeyNames": [ # [Output Only] Names of the keys for signing request URLs.
        "A String",
      ],
      "signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec": "A String", # Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses will not be altered.
    },
    "enableCdn": True or False, # If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendBucket.
    "selfLinkWithId": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with the resource id.
    "bucketName": "A String", # Cloud Storage bucket name.
    "creationTimestamp": "A String", # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
    "id": "A String", # [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.
    "selfLink": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    "name": "A String", # Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of BackendBucket resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Contains a list of BackendBucket resources.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(project, backendBucket, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the specified BackendBucket resource with the data included in the request. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  backendBucket: string, Name of the BackendBucket resource to patch. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A BackendBucket resource. This resource defines a Cloud Storage bucket.
    "kind": "compute#backendBucket", # Type of the resource.
    "description": "A String", # An optional textual description of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
    "cdnPolicy": { # Message containing Cloud CDN configuration for a backend bucket. # Cloud CDN configuration for this BackendBucket.
      "signedUrlKeyNames": [ # [Output Only] Names of the keys for signing request URLs.
        "A String",
      ],
      "signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec": "A String", # Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses will not be altered.
    },
    "enableCdn": True or False, # If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendBucket.
    "selfLinkWithId": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with the resource id.
    "bucketName": "A String", # Cloud Storage bucket name.
    "creationTimestamp": "A String", # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
    "id": "A String", # [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.
    "selfLink": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    "name": "A String", # Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

      # A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups, Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions defined by IAM.
      #
      # **JSON Example**
      #
      # { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/owner", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/viewer", "members": ["user:sean@example.com"] } ] }
      #
      # **YAML Example**
      #
      # bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/owner - members: - user:sean@example.com role: roles/viewer

  <pre>Updates the specified BackendBucket resource with the data included in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  backendBucket: string, Name of the BackendBucket resource to update. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

The actual headers served in responses will not be altered.
    },

    "name": "A String", # Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
