<div class="method">

  <pre>Creates a new WorkloadIdentityPool. You cannot reuse the name of a deleted pool until 30 days after deletion.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource to create the pool in. The only supported location is `global`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a collection of external workload identities. You can define IAM policies to grant these identities access to Google Cloud resources.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the pool. Cannot exceed 256 characters.
  &quot;disabled&quot;: True or False, # Whether the pool is disabled. You cannot use a disabled pool to exchange tokens, or use existing tokens to access resources. If the pool is re-enabled, existing tokens grant access again.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A display name for the pool. Cannot exceed 32 characters.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the pool.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the pool.
}

  workloadIdentityPoolId: string, Required. The ID to use for the pool, which becomes the final component of the resource name. This value should be 4-32 characters, and may contain the characters [a-z0-9-]. The prefix `gcp-` is reserved for use by Google, and may not be specified.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
