<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchDelete">batchDelete(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a list of Job postings by filter.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only. Batch delete jobs request.
    &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The filter string specifies the jobs to be deleted. Supported operator: =, AND The fields eligible for filtering are: * `companyName` (Required) * `requisitionId` (Required) Sample Query: companyName = &quot;companies/123&quot; AND requisitionId = &quot;req-1&quot;
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new job. Typically, the job becomes searchable within 10 seconds, but it may take up to 5 minutes.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only. Create job request.
    &quot;job&quot;: { # A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a &quot;job listing&quot; or &quot;job requisition&quot;). A job belongs to a Company, which is the hiring entity responsible for the job. # Required. The Job to be created.
      &quot;expiryDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, e.g. a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are not significant. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. This can represent: * A full date, with non-zero year, month and day values * A month and day value, with a zero year, e.g. an anniversary * A year on its own, with zero month and day values * A year and month value, with a zero day, e.g. a credit card expiration date Related types are google.type.TimeOfDay and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # Deprecated. Use expire_time instead. Optional but strongly recommended to be provided for the best service experience. The expiration date of the job in UTC time. After 12 am on this date, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration date. It can also remain expired. Updating an expired job to be open fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are removed first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. A valid date range is between 1970/1/1 and 2100/12/31. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expiry date not provided. If this value is not provided on job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_date, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
        &quot;year&quot;: 42, # Year of date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 if specifying a date without a year.
        &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Day of month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 if specifying a year by itself or a year and month where the day is not significant.
        &quot;month&quot;: 42, # Month of year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 if specifying a year without a month and day.

However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. The format of this field is RFC 3339 date strings. Example: 2000-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). A valid date range is between 1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z and 2100-12-31T23:59:59.999Z. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expire time not provided. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is used. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.

A map of fields to hold filterable custom job attributes not captured by the standard fields such as job_title, company_name, or level. These custom fields store arbitrary string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the structured rather than custom fields is recommended. Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and searched against by keyword searches (see SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]). The map key must be a number between 1-20. If an invalid key is provided on job create or update, an error is returned.

For example, &quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and &quot;Kansas City, KS, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY.
          &quot;radiusMeters&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 7885.79 meters.
          &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
            &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
            &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
            &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
              &quot;A String&quot;,
            ],
            &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

            ],
            &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
            &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
            &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
            &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
            &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.

    { # A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a &quot;job listing&quot; or &quot;job requisition&quot;). A job belongs to a Company, which is the hiring entity responsible for the job.
    &quot;expiryDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, e.g. a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are not significant. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. This can represent: * A full date, with non-zero year, month and day values * A month and day value, with a zero year, e.g. an anniversary * A year on its own, with zero month and day values * A year and month value, with a zero day, e.g. a credit card expiration date Related types are google.type.TimeOfDay and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # Deprecated. Use expire_time instead. Optional but strongly recommended to be provided for the best service experience. The expiration date of the job in UTC time. After 12 am on this date, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration date. It can also remain expired. Updating an expired job to be open fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are removed first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. A valid date range is between 1970/1/1 and 2100/12/31. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expiry date not provided. If this value is not provided on job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_date, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.

For example, &quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and &quot;Kansas City, KS, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY.
        &quot;radiusMeters&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 7885.79 meters.
        &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
          &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

          &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.

    { # A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a &quot;job listing&quot; or &quot;job requisition&quot;). A job belongs to a Company, which is the hiring entity responsible for the job.
    &quot;expiryDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, e.g. a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are not significant. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. This can represent: * A full date, with non-zero year, month and day values * A month and day value, with a zero year, e.g. an anniversary * A year on its own, with zero month and day values * A year and month value, with a zero day, e.g. a credit card expiration date Related types are google.type.TimeOfDay and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # Deprecated. Use expire_time instead. Optional but strongly recommended to be provided for the best service experience. The expiration date of the job in UTC time. After 12 am on this date, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration date. It can also remain expired. Updating an expired job to be open fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are removed first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. A valid date range is between 1970/1/1 and 2100/12/31. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expiry date not provided. If this value is not provided on job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_date, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.

An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. The format of this field is RFC 3339 date strings. Example: 2000-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). A valid date range is between 1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z and 2100-12-31T23:59:59.999Z. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expire time not provided. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is used. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields.

    &quot;filterableCustomFields&quot;: { # Deprecated. Use custom_attributes instead. Optional. A map of fields to hold filterable custom job attributes not captured by the standard fields such as job_title, company_name, or level. These custom fields store arbitrary string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the structured rather than custom fields is recommended. Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and searched against by keyword searches (see SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]). The map key must be a number between 1-20. If an invalid key is provided on job create or update, an error is returned.

      { # Output only. A resource that represents a location with full geographic information.
        &quot;locationType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, &quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and &quot;Kansas City, KS, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY.
        &quot;radiusMeters&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 7885.79 meters.
        &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
          &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
          &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
          &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.

If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job if an exact location match is not specified. If this field is set, setting job locations to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(idsOnly=None, filter=None, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists jobs by filter.

Args:
  idsOnly: boolean, Optional. If set to `true`, only Job.name, Job.requisition_id and Job.language_code will be returned. A typical use case is to synchronize job repositories. Defaults to false.
  filter: string, Required. The filter string specifies the jobs to be enumerated. Supported operator: =, AND The fields eligible for filtering are: * `companyName` (Required) * `requisitionId` (Optional) Sample Query: * companyName = &quot;companies/123&quot; * companyName = &quot;companies/123&quot; AND requisitionId = &quot;req-1&quot;
  pageToken: string, Optional. The starting point of a query result.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of jobs to be returned per page of results. If ids_only is set to true, the maximum allowed page size is 1000. Otherwise, the maximum allowed page size is 100. Default is 100 if empty or a number &lt; 1 is specified.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Output only. List jobs response.
    &quot;jobs&quot;: [ # The Jobs for a given company. The maximum number of items returned is based on the limit field provided in the request.
      { # A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a &quot;job listing&quot; or &quot;job requisition&quot;). A job belongs to a Company, which is the hiring entity responsible for the job.
        &quot;expiryDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, e.g. a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are not significant. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. This can represent: * A full date, with non-zero year, month and day values * A month and day value, with a zero year, e.g. an anniversary * A year on its own, with zero month and day values * A year and month value, with a zero day, e.g. a credit card expiration date Related types are google.type.TimeOfDay and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # Deprecated. Use expire_time instead. Optional but strongly recommended to be provided for the best service experience. The expiration date of the job in UTC time. After 12 am on this date, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration date. It can also remain expired. Updating an expired job to be open fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are removed first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. A valid date range is between 1970/1/1 and 2100/12/31. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expiry date not provided. If this value is not provided on job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_date, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
          &quot;year&quot;: 42, # Year of date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 if specifying a date without a year.
          &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Day of month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 if specifying a year by itself or a year and month where the day is not significant.

However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. The format of this field is RFC 3339 date strings. Example: 2000-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).

If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is used. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.

A map of fields to hold filterable custom job attributes not captured by the standard fields such as job_title, company_name, or level. These custom fields store arbitrary string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the structured rather than custom fields is recommended. Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and searched against by keyword searches (see SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]). The map key must be a number between 1-20. If an invalid key is provided on job create or update, an error is returned.
          &quot;a_key&quot;: { # Resource that represents the custom data not captured by the standard fields.

            &quot;locationType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, &quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and &quot;Kansas City, KS, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY.
            &quot;radiusMeters&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 7885.79 meters.
            &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
              &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
              &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
              &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

              ],
              &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
              &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
              &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
              &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
              &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
              &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.

    &quot;job&quot;: { # A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a &quot;job listing&quot; or &quot;job requisition&quot;). A job belongs to a Company, which is the hiring entity responsible for the job. # Required. The Job to be updated.
      &quot;expiryDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, e.g. a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are not significant. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. This can represent: * A full date, with non-zero year, month and day values * A month and day value, with a zero year, e.g. an anniversary * A year on its own, with zero month and day values * A year and month value, with a zero day, e.g. a credit card expiration date Related types are google.type.TimeOfDay and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # Deprecated. Use expire_time instead. Optional but strongly recommended to be provided for the best service experience. The expiration date of the job in UTC time. After 12 am on this date, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration date. It can also remain expired. Updating an expired job to be open fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are removed first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. A valid date range is between 1970/1/1 and 2100/12/31. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expiry date not provided. If this value is not provided on job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_date, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.

However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. The format of this field is RFC 3339 date strings. Example: 2000-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). A valid date range is between 1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z and 2100-12-31T23:59:59.999Z. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expire time not provided. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is used. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields.

A map of fields to hold filterable custom job attributes not captured by the standard fields such as job_title, company_name, or level. These custom fields store arbitrary string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the structured rather than custom fields is recommended. Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and searched against by keyword searches (see SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]). The map key must be a number between 1-20. If an invalid key is provided on job create or update, an error is returned.

For example, &quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and &quot;Kansas City, KS, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY.
          &quot;radiusMeters&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 7885.79 meters.
          &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
            &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
            &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
            &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

            &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
            &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
            &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
            &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
            &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.

    &quot;expiryDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, e.g. a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are not significant.

Use expire_time instead. Optional but strongly recommended to be provided for the best service experience. The expiration date of the job in UTC time. After 12 am on this date, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration date. It can also remain expired. Updating an expired job to be open fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are removed first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. A valid date range is between 1970/1/1 and 2100/12/31. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expiry date not provided. If this value is not provided on job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_date, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.

      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. The format of this field is RFC 3339 date strings. Example: 2000-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). A valid date range is between 1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z and 2100-12-31T23:59:59.999Z. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expire time not provided. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is used. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
    &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # Optional. The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;filterableCustomFields&quot;: { # Deprecated. Use custom_attributes instead. Optional. A map of fields to hold filterable custom job attributes not captured by the standard fields such as job_title, company_name, or level. These custom fields store arbitrary string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the structured rather than custom fields is recommended. Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and searched against by keyword searches (see SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]). The map key must be a number between 1-20. If an invalid key is provided on job create or update, an error is returned.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: { # Resource that represents the custom data not captured by the standard fields.

      { # Output only. A resource that represents a location with full geographic information.
        &quot;locationType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, &quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and &quot;Kansas City, KS, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY.
        &quot;radiusMeters&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 7885.79 meters.
        &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
          &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

          &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

          ],
          &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
          &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.

  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest. This call constrains the visibility of jobs present in the database, and only returns jobs that the caller has permission to search against.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only. The Request body of the `SearchJobs` call.
    &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # Optional. A limit on the number of jobs returned in the search results. Increasing this value above the default value of 10 can increase search response time. The value can be between 1 and 100.
    &quot;offset&quot;: 42, # Optional. An integer that specifies the current offset (that is, starting result location, amongst the jobs deemed by the API as relevant) in search results. This field is only considered if page_token is unset. For example, 0 means to return results starting from the first matching job, and 10 means to return from the 11th job. This can be used for pagination, (for example, pageSize = 10 and offset = 10 means to return from the second page).
    &quot;disableRelevanceThresholding&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Controls whether to disable relevance thresholding. Relevance thresholding removes jobs that have low relevance in search results, for example, removing &quot;Assistant to the CEO&quot; positions from the search results of a search for &quot;CEO&quot;. Disabling relevance thresholding improves the accuracy of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false.
    &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Mode of a search.
    &quot;requestMetadata&quot;: { # Input only. Meta information related to the job searcher or entity conducting the job search. This information is used to improve the performance of the service. # Required. The meta information collected about the job searcher, used to improve the search quality of the service. The identifiers, (such as `user_id`) are provided by users, and must be unique and consistent.
      &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The client-defined scope or source of the service call, which typically is the domain on which the service has been implemented and is currently being run. For example, if the service is being run by client *Foo, Inc.*, on job board www.foo.com and career site www.bar.com, then this field is set to &quot;foo.com&quot; for use on the job board, and &quot;bar.com&quot; for use on the career site. If this field is not available for some reason, send &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;. Note that any improvements to the service model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to some domain.
      &quot;deviceInfo&quot;: { # Input only. Device information collected from the job seeker, candidate, or other entity conducting the job search. Providing this information improves the quality of the search results across devices. # Optional. The type of device used by the job seeker at the time of the call to the service.
        &quot;deviceType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Type of the device.

      },
      &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique user identification string, as determined by the client. The client is responsible for ensuring client-level uniqueness of this value in order to have the strongest positive impact on search quality. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the service. If this field is not available for some reason, please send &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;. Note that any improvements to the service model for a particular tenant site, rely on this field being set correctly to some unique user_id.
      &quot;sessionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique session identification string. A session is defined as the duration of an end user&#x27;s interaction with the service over a period. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the API. If this field is not available for some reason, please send &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;.

Updating an expired job to be open fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are removed first.

The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. This can represent: * A full date, with non-zero year, month and day values * A month and day value, with a zero year, e.g. an anniversary * A year on its own, with zero month and day values * A year and month value, with a zero day, e.g. a credit card expiration date Related types are google.type.TimeOfDay and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # Optional.

          &quot;applicationEmailList&quot;: [ # Optional but at least one of application_urls, application_email_list or application_instruction must be specified. Use this field to specify email address(es) to which resumes or applications can be sent. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. The format of this field is RFC 3339 date strings. Example: 2000-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). A valid date range is between 1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z and 2100-12-31T23:59:59.999Z. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expire time not provided. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is used. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
          &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # Optional. The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.

          &quot;filterableCustomFields&quot;: { # Deprecated. Use custom_attributes instead. Optional. A map of fields to hold filterable custom job attributes not captured by the standard fields such as job_title, company_name, or level. These custom fields store arbitrary string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the structured rather than custom fields is recommended. Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and searched against by keyword searches (see SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]). The map key must be a number between 1-20. If an invalid key is provided on job create or update, an error is returned.
            &quot;a_key&quot;: { # Resource that represents the custom data not captured by the standard fields.

            { # Output only. A resource that represents a location with full geographic information.
              &quot;locationType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, &quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and &quot;Kansas City, KS, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY.
              &quot;radiusMeters&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 7885.79 meters.
              &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
                &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
                &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
                &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

                &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
                &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
                &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="searchForAlert">searchForAlert(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest. This API call is intended for the use case of targeting passive job seekers (for example, job seekers who have signed up to receive email alerts about potential job opportunities), and has different algorithmic adjustments that are targeted to passive job seekers. This call constrains the visibility of jobs present in the database, and only returns jobs the caller has permission to search against.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only. The Request body of the `SearchJobs` call.
    &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # Optional. A limit on the number of jobs returned in the search results. Increasing this value above the default value of 10 can increase search response time. The value can be between 1 and 100.
    &quot;offset&quot;: 42, # Optional. An integer that specifies the current offset (that is, starting result location, amongst the jobs deemed by the API as relevant) in search results. This field is only considered if page_token is unset. For example, 0 means to return results starting from the first matching job, and 10 means to return from the 11th job. This can be used for pagination, (for example, pageSize = 10 and offset = 10 means to return from the second page).
    &quot;disableRelevanceThresholding&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Controls whether to disable relevance thresholding. Relevance thresholding removes jobs that have low relevance in search results, for example, removing &quot;Assistant to the CEO&quot; positions from the search results of a search for &quot;CEO&quot;. Disabling relevance thresholding improves the accuracy of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false.
    &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Mode of a search.
    &quot;requestMetadata&quot;: { # Input only. Meta information related to the job searcher or entity conducting the job search. This information is used to improve the performance of the service. # Required. The meta information collected about the job searcher, used to improve the search quality of the service. The identifiers, (such as `user_id`) are provided by users, and must be unique and consistent.
      &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The client-defined scope or source of the service call, which typically is the domain on which the service has been implemented and is currently being run. For example, if the service is being run by client *Foo, Inc.*, on job board www.foo.com and career site www.bar.com, then this field is set to &quot;foo.com&quot; for use on the job board, and &quot;bar.com&quot; for use on the career site. If this field is not available for some reason, send &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;. Note that any improvements to the service model for a particular tenant site rely on this field being set correctly to some domain.
      &quot;deviceInfo&quot;: { # Input only. Device information collected from the job seeker, candidate, or other entity conducting the job search. Providing this information improves the quality of the search results across devices. # Optional. The type of device used by the job seeker at the time of the call to the service.
        &quot;deviceType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Type of the device.
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A device-specific ID. The ID must be a unique identifier that distinguishes the device from other devices.
      },
      &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique user identification string, as determined by the client. The client is responsible for ensuring client-level uniqueness of this value in order to have the strongest positive impact on search quality. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the service. If this field is not available for some reason, please send &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;. Note that any improvements to the service model for a particular tenant site, rely on this field being set correctly to some unique user_id.
      &quot;sessionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique session identification string. A session is defined as the duration of an end user&#x27;s interaction with the service over a period. Obfuscate this field for privacy concerns before providing it to the API. If this field is not available for some reason, please send &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;. Note that any improvements to the service model for a particular tenant site, rely on this field being set correctly to some unique session_id.
    },
    &quot;sortBy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Defaults to SortBy.RELEVANCE_DESC if no value is specified.
    &quot;orderBy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Deprecated. Use sort_by instead. Optional. The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Defaults to SortBy.RELEVANCE_DESC if no value is specified.
    &quot;filters&quot;: { # Input only. Deprecated. Use JobQuery instead. The filters required to perform a search query or histogram. # Deprecated. Use query instead. Optional. Restrictions on the scope of the search request, such as filtering by location.
      &quot;customAttributeFilter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. This filter specifies a structured syntax to match against the Job.custom_attributes that are marked as `filterable`. The syntax for this expression is a subset of Google SQL syntax.

However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are removed first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. A valid date range is between 1970/1/1 and 2100/12/31. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expiry date not provided. If this value is not provided on job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_date, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.

          &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. The format of this field is RFC 3339 date strings. Example: 2000-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). A valid date range is between 1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z and 2100-12-31T23:59:59.999Z. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expire time not provided. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is used. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.

A map of fields to hold filterable custom job attributes not captured by the standard fields such as job_title, company_name, or level. These custom fields store arbitrary string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the structured rather than custom fields is recommended. Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and searched against by keyword searches (see SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]). The map key must be a number between 1-20. If an invalid key is provided on job create or update, an error is returned.

              &quot;locationType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, &quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and &quot;Kansas City, KS, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY.
              &quot;radiusMeters&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in meters of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng coves the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 7885.79 meters.
              &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
                &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
                &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
                &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

                &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
                &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
                &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
