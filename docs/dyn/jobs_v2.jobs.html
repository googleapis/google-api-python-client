<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchDelete">batchDelete(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a list of Job postings by filter.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only.
      # 
      # Batch delete jobs request.
    &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The filter string specifies the jobs to be deleted.
        # 
        # Supported operator: =, AND
        # 
        # The fields eligible for filtering are:
        # 
        # * `companyName` (Required)
        # * `requisitionId` (Required)
        # 
        # Sample Query: companyName = &quot;companies/123&quot; AND requisitionId = &quot;req-1&quot;
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.

              # &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
              # address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the

              # &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of
              # an address can be selected based on the language.

          &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used
              # in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like

              # alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot;

          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if

              # transliterated equivalents.
              # This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical

synchronously wait for validation, indexing, and general processing to be
completed before the response is returned.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Deprecated. Use BatchDeleteJobsRequest instead.
      # 
      # Input only.
      # 
      # Delete job by filter request.
      # 
      # The job typically becomes unsearchable within 10 seconds, but it may take
      # up to 5 minutes.
    &quot;disableFastProcess&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If set to true, this call waits for all processing steps to complete
        # before the job is cleaned up. Otherwise, the call returns while some
        # steps are still taking place asynchronously, hence faster.
    &quot;filter&quot;: { # Deprecated. Use BatchDeleteJobsRequest instead. # Required. Restrictions on the scope of the delete request.

              # addresses of a country or region.
              # For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.

              # sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
              # &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
              # address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the
              # address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is

              # &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of
              # an address can be selected based on the language.

              # &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number
              # alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot;

          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if

              # transliterated equivalents.
              # This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical

                  # In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit
                  # into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
              &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal
                  # addresses of a country or region.
                  # For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.
                  # Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous
                  # community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;).
                  # Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g.
                  # in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.

                  #
                  # Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may
                  # sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
                  # &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
                  # address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the
                  # address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is
                  # used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and
                  # &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of
                  # an address can be selected based on the language.
                  #
                  # The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists
                  # of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the
                  # address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very
                  # approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be
                  # made about any of the address components until it was at least
                  # partially resolved.
                  #
                  # Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and
                  # then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured
                  # addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be

                # &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of

            #    https://github.com/google/libaddressinput)

          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal
              # addresses of a country or region.
              # For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.

              # sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
              # &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
              # address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the
              # address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is

              # &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of
              # an address can be selected based on the language.

              # partially resolved.
              #

          &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used
              # in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like
              # &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number
              # alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot;

          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if

              # to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their
              # transliterated equivalents.
              # This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical
              # to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or
              # other non-formatting related operations.

              # &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of

              # &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of

  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest.

This API call is intended for the use case of targeting passive job
seekers (for example, job seekers who have signed up to receive email
alerts about potential job opportunities), and has different algorithmic
adjustments that are targeted to passive job seekers.

This call constrains the visibility of jobs
present in the database, and only returns jobs the caller has
permission to search against.

Args:

        # 
        # For example, 0 means to  return results starting from the first matching
        # job, and 10 means to return from the 11th job. This can be used for
        # pagination, (for example, pageSize = 10 and offset = 10 means to return
        # from the second page).
    &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # Optional. A limit on the number of jobs returned in the search results.

            #    https://github.com/google/libaddressinput)

          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal
              # addresses of a country or region.
              # For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.

              # community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;).

              # sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
              # &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
              # address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the
              # address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is

              # &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of
              # an address can be selected based on the language.

              # partially resolved.

              # additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip
              # validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used
              # in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like
              # &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number
              # alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot;
              # (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if
              # known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected
              # to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their
              # transliterated equivalents.
              # This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical
