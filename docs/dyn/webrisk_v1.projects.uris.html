<p class="firstline">Submits a URI suspected of containing malicious content to be reviewed. Returns a google.longrunning.Operation which, once the review is complete, is updated with its result. You can use the [Pub/Sub API] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub) to receive notifications for the returned Operation. If the result verifies the existence of malicious content, the site will be added to the [Google's Social Engineering lists] (https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6350487/) in order to protect users that could get exposed to this threat in the future. Only allowlisted projects can use this method during Early Access. Please reach out to Sales or your customer engineer to obtain access.</p>

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project that is making the submission. This string is in the format &quot;projects/{project_number}&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to send a potentially malicious URI to WebRisk.
  &quot;submission&quot;: { # Wraps a URI that might be displaying malicious content. # Required. The submission that contains the URI to be scanned.
    &quot;threatTypes&quot;: [ # ThreatTypes found to be associated with the submitted URI after reviewing it. This might be empty if the URI was not added to any list.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The URI that is being reported for malicious content to be analyzed.
  },
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Contains a `SubmitUriMetadata` object.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Matches the `/v1/{project-name}/operations/{operation-id}` pattern.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
