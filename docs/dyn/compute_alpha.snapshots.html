<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of Snapshot resources contained within the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setLabels">setLabels(project, resource, body)</code>
  <pre>Sets the labels on a snapshot. To learn more about labels, read the Labeling or Tagging Resources documentation.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  resource: string, Name of the resource for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "labelFingerprint": "A String", # The fingerprint of the previous set of labels for this resource, used to detect conflicts. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash when updating or changing labels. Make a get() request to the resource to get the latest fingerprint.
    "labels": { # A list of labels to apply for this resource. Each label key & value must comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. For example, "webserver-frontend": "images". A label value can also be empty (e.g. "my-label": "").
      "a_key": "A String",
    },
  }


Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Operation resource, used to manage asynchronous API requests.

    "clientOperationId": "A String", # [Output Only] Reserved for future use.
    "creationTimestamp": "A String", # [Deprecated] This field is deprecated.
    "id": "A String", # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
    "zone": "A String", # [Output Only] The URL of the zone where the operation resides. Only available when performing per-zone operations.
    "insertTime": "A String", # [Output Only] The time that this operation was requested. This value is in RFC3339 text format.
    "operationType": "A String", # [Output Only] The type of operation, such as insert, update, or delete, and so on.
    "httpErrorMessage": "A String", # [Output Only] If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error message that was returned, such as NOT FOUND.
    "progress": 42, # [Output Only] An optional progress indicator that ranges from 0 to 100. There is no requirement that this be linear or support any granularity of operations. This should not be used to guess when the operation will be complete. This number should monotonically increase as the operation progresses.
    "httpErrorStatusCode": 42, # [Output Only] If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error status code that was returned. For example, a 404 means the resource was not found.
    "statusMessage": "A String", # [Output Only] An optional textual description of the current status of the operation.
    "status": "A String", # [Output Only] The status of the operation, which can be one of the following: PENDING, RUNNING, or DONE.
    "description": "A String", # [Output Only] A textual description of the operation, which is set when the operation is created.
    "warnings": [ # [Output Only] If warning messages are generated during processing of the operation, this field will be populated.
      {
        "message": "A String", # [Output Only] A human-readable description of the warning code.
        "code": "A String", # [Output Only] A warning code, if applicable. For example, Compute Engine returns NO_RESULTS_ON_PAGE if there are no results in the response.
        "data": [ # [Output Only] Metadata about this warning in key: value format. For example:
            # "data": [ { "key": "scope", "value": "zones/us-east1-d" }

            "value": "A String", # [Output Only] A warning data value corresponding to the key.
            "key": "A String", # [Output Only] A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding).

    "selfLink": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    "targetLink": "A String", # [Output Only] The URL of the resource that the operation modifies. For operations related to creating a snapshot, this points to the persistent disk that the snapshot was created from.
