  <pre>Creates a QaQuestionTag.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the QaQuestionTag. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A tag is a resource which aims to categorize a set of questions across multiple scorecards, e.g., &quot;Customer Satisfaction&quot;,&quot;Billing&quot;, etc.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the question tag was created.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A user-specified display name for the tag.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. Resource name for the QaQuestionTag Format projects/{project}/locations/{location}/qaQuestionTags/{qa_question_tag} In the above format, the last segment, i.e., qa_question_tag, is a server-generated ID corresponding to the tag resource.
  &quot;qaQuestionIds&quot;: [ # Optional. The list of Scorecard Question IDs that the tag applies to. Each QaQuestionId is represented as a full resource name containing the Question ID. Lastly, Since a tag may not necessarily be referenced by any Scorecard Questions, we treat this field as optional.

  ],
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The most recent time at which the question tag was updated.
}

  qaQuestionTagId: string, Optional. A unique ID for the new QaQuestionTag. This ID will become the final component of the QaQuestionTag&#x27;s resource name.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
