  <pre>Creates a new `ManagementDnsZoneBinding` resource in a private cloud. This RPC creates the DNS binding and the resource that represents the DNS binding of the consumer VPC network to the management DNS zone. A management DNS zone is the Cloud DNS cross-project binding zone that VMware Engine creates for each private cloud. It contains FQDNs and corresponding IP addresses for the private cloud&#x27;s ESXi hosts and management VM appliances like vCenter and NSX Manager.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the private cloud to create a new management DNS zone binding for. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a binding between a network and the management DNS zone. A management DNS zone is the Cloud DNS cross-project binding zone that VMware Engine creates for each private cloud. It contains FQDNs and corresponding IP addresses for the private cloud&#x27;s ESXi hosts and management VM appliances like vCenter and NSX Manager.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of this resource.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User-provided description for this resource.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of this binding. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud/managementDnsZoneBindings/my-management-dns-zone-binding`
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the resource.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. System-generated unique identifier for the resource.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of this resource.
  &quot;vmwareEngineNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Network to bind is a VMware Engine network. Specify the name in the following form for VMware engine network: `projects/{project}/locations/global/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}`. `{project}` can either be a project number or a project ID.
  &quot;vpcNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Network to bind is a standard consumer VPC. Specify the name in the following form for consumer VPC network: `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network_id}`. `{project}` can either be a project number or a project ID.
}

  managementDnsZoneBindingId: string, Required. The user-provided identifier of the `ManagementDnsZoneBinding` resource to be created. This identifier must be unique among `ManagementDnsZoneBinding` resources within the parent and becomes the final token in the name URI. The identifier must meet the following requirements: * Only contains 1-63 alphanumeric characters and hyphens * Begins with an alphabetical character * Ends with a non-hyphen character * Not formatted as a UUID * Complies with [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) (section 3.5)
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="repair">repair(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retries to create a `ManagementDnsZoneBinding` resource that is in failed state.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the management DNS zone binding to repair. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud/managementDnsZoneBindings/my-management-dns-zone-binding` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for VmwareEngine.RepairManagementDnsZoneBindings
  &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
