  <pre>Create a new watch. If a watch ID is provided, it must be unused. For each invoking project, the per form limit is one watch per Watch.EventType. A watch expires seven days after it is created (see Watch.expire_time).

Args:
  formId: string, Required. ID of the Form to watch. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Create a new watch.
  &quot;watch&quot;: { # A watch for events for a form. When the designated event happens, a notification will be published to the specified target. The notification&#x27;s attributes will include a `formId` key that has the ID of the watched form and an `eventType` key that has the string of the type. Messages are sent with at-least-once delivery and are only dropped in extraordinary circumstances. Typically all notifications should be reliably delivered within a few seconds; however, in some situations notifications may be delayed. A watch expires seven days after it is created unless it is renewed with watches.renew # Required. The watch object. No ID should be set on this object; use `watch_id` instead.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp of when this was created.
    &quot;errorType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The most recent error type for an attempted delivery. To begin watching the form again a call can be made to watches.renew which also clears this error information.
    &quot;eventType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Which event type to watch for.
    &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp for when this will expire. Each watches.renew call resets this to seven days in the future.
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The ID of this watch. See notes on CreateWatchRequest.watch_id.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the watch. Additional details about suspended watches can be found by checking the `error_type`.
    &quot;target&quot;: { # The target for notification delivery. # Required. Where to send the notification.
      &quot;topic&quot;: { # A Pub/Sub topic. # A Pub/Sub topic. To receive notifications, the topic must grant publish privileges to the Forms service account `serviceAccount:forms-notifications@system.gserviceaccount.com`. Only the project that owns a topic may create a watch with it. Pub/Sub delivery guarantees should be considered.
        &quot;topicName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A fully qualified Pub/Sub topic name to publish the events to. This topic must be owned by the calling project and already exist in Pub/Sub.
      },
    },
  },
  &quot;watchId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID to use for the watch. If specified, the ID must not already be in use. If not specified, an ID is generated. This value should be 4-63 characters, and valid characters are /a-z-/.
