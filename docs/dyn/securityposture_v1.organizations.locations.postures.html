To prevent concurrent updates from overwriting each other, always follow the read-modify-write pattern when you update a posture: 1. Call GetPosture to get the current version of the posture. 2. Update the fields in the posture as needed. 3. Call UpdatePosture to update the posture. Ensure that your request includes the `etag` value from the GetPosture response. **Important:** If you omit the `etag` when you call UpdatePosture, then the updated posture unconditionally overwrites the existing posture.</p>

  <pre>Updates a revision of an existing Posture. If the posture revision that you update is currently deployed, then a new revision of the posture is created.

Update the fields in the posture as needed. 3. Call UpdatePosture to update the posture. Ensure that your request includes the `etag` value from the GetPosture response. **Important:** If you omit the `etag` when you call UpdatePosture, then the updated posture unconditionally overwrites the existing posture.

Optionally, you can add the `is:` prefix to these values. If the value contains a colon (`:`), then the `is:` prefix is required. Some constraints allow you to specify a portion of the resource hierarchy, known as a [_hierarchy subtree_](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/help/organization-policy/hierarchy-subtree), that the constraint applies to. To specify a hierarchy subtree, use the `under:` prefix, followed by a value with one of these formats: - `projects/{project_id}` (for example, `projects/tokyo-rain-123`) - `folders/{folder_id}` (for example, `folders/1234567890123`) - `organizations/{organization_id}` (for example, `organizations/123456789012`) A constraint&#x27;s `supports_under` field indicates whether you can specify a hierarchy subtree. To learn which predefined constraints let you specify a hierarchy subtree, see the [constraints reference](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/help/organization-policy/constraints/reference). # The allowed and denied values for a list constraint. Valid only for list constraints.
