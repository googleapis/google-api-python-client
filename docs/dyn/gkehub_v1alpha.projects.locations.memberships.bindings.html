<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, membershipBindingId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a MembershipBinding.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent (project and location) where the MembershipBinding will be created. Specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*/memberships/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # MembershipBinding is a subresource of a Membership, representing what Fleet Scopes (or other, future Fleet resources) a Membership is bound to.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the membership binding was created.
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the membership binding was deleted.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels for this MembershipBinding.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name for the membershipbinding itself `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/memberships/{membership}/bindings/{membershipbinding}`
  &quot;scope&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A Scope resource name in the format `projects/*/locations/*/scopes/*`.
  &quot;state&quot;: { # MembershipBindingLifecycleState describes the state of a Binding resource. # Output only. State of the membership binding resource.
    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the MembershipBinding resource.
  },
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Google-generated UUID for this resource. This is unique across all membershipbinding resources. If a membershipbinding resource is deleted and another resource with the same name is created, it gets a different uid.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the membership binding was last updated.
}

  membershipBindingId: string, Required. The ID to use for the MembershipBinding.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
