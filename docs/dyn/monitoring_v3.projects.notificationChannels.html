Args:

The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER] This names the container into which the channel will be written, this does not name the newly created channel. The resulting channel&#x27;s name will have a normalized version of this field as a prefix, but will add /notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID] to identify the channel. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  <pre>Requests a verification code for an already verified channel that can then be used in a call to VerifyNotificationChannel() on a different channel with an equivalent identity in the same or in a different project.

If omitted, a default expiration will be used, which may be less than the max permissible expiration (so specifying an expiration may extend the code&#x27;s lifetime over omitting an expiration, even though the API does impose an upper limit on the maximum expiration that is permitted).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="sendVerificationCode">sendVerificationCode(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Causes a verification code to be delivered to the channel. The code can then be supplied in VerifyNotificationChannel to verify the channel.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The notification channel to which to send a verification code. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode request.
}

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for Empty is empty JSON object {}.
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="verify">verify(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Verifies a NotificationChannel by proving receipt of the code delivered to the channel as a result of calling SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The notification channel to verify. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The VerifyNotificationChannel request.
  &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The verification code that was delivered to the channel as a result of invoking the SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode API method or that was retrieved from a verified channel via GetNotificationChannelVerificationCode. For example, one might have &quot;G-123456&quot; or &quot;TKNZGhhd2EyN3I1MnRnMjRv&quot; (in general, one is only guaranteed that the code is valid UTF-8; one should not make any assumptions regarding the structure or format of the code).
