  dataset: string, Determines which dataset to use for fetching completion. &quot;user-data&quot; will use the imported dataset through CompletionService.ImportCompletionData. &quot;cloud-retail&quot; will use the dataset generated by cloud retail based on user events. If leave empty, it will use the &quot;user-data&quot;. Current supported values: * user-data * cloud-retail This option requires additional allowlisting. Before using cloud-retail, contact Cloud Retail support team first.
  deviceType: string, The device type context for completion suggestions. It is useful to apply different suggestions on different device types, e.g. `DESKTOP`, `MOBILE`. If it is empty, the suggestions are across all device types. Supported formats: * `UNKNOWN_DEVICE_TYPE` * `DESKTOP` * `MOBILE` * A customized string starts with `OTHER_`, e.g. `OTHER_IPHONE`.

When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Please submit a form [here](https://cloud.google.com/contact) to contact cloud sales if you are interested in using Retail Search.

Args:
  catalog: string, Full resource name of the catalog, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message to set a specified branch as new default_branch.
  &quot;branchId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The final component of the resource name of a branch. This field must be one of &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot;. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
  &quot;note&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Some note on this request, this can be retrieved by CatalogService.GetDefaultBranch before next valid default branch set occurs. This field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
