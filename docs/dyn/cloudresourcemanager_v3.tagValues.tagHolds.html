  <pre>Creates a TagHold. Returns ALREADY_EXISTS if a TagHold with the same resource and origin exists under the same TagValue.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the TagHold&#x27;s parent TagValue. Must be of the form: `tagValues/{tag-value-id}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A TagHold represents the use of a TagValue that is not captured by TagBindings. If a TagValue has any TagHolds, deletion will be blocked. This resource is intended to be created in the same cloud location as the `holder`.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time this TagHold was created.
  &quot;helpLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A URL where an end user can learn more about removing this hold. E.g. `https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/tags/tags-creating-and-managing`
  &quot;holder&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the resource where the TagValue is being used. Must be less than 200 characters. E.g. `//compute.googleapis.com/compute/projects/myproject/regions/us-east-1/instanceGroupManagers/instance-group`
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of a TagHold. This is a String of the form: `tagValues/{tag-value-id}/tagHolds/{tag-hold-id}` (e.g. `tagValues/123/tagHolds/456`). This resource name is generated by the server.
  &quot;origin&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An optional string representing the origin of this request. This field should include human-understandable information to distinguish origins from each other. Must be less than 200 characters. E.g. `migs-35678234`
}

  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. Set to true to perform the validations necessary for creating the resource, but not actually perform the action.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
}</pre>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, validateOnly=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a TagHold.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the TagHold to delete. Must be of the form: `tagValues/{tag-value-id}/tagHolds/{tag-hold-id}`. (required)
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. Set to true to perform the validations necessary for deleting the resource, but not actually perform the action.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists TagHolds under a TagValue.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the parent TagValue. Must be of the form: `tagValues/{tag-value-id}`. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Criteria used to select a subset of TagHolds parented by the TagValue to return. This field follows the syntax defined by aip.dev/160; the `holder` and `origin` fields are supported for filtering. Currently only `AND` syntax is supported. Some example queries are: * `holder = //compute.googleapis.com/compute/projects/myproject/regions/us-east-1/instanceGroupManagers/instance-group` * `origin = 35678234` * `holder = //compute.googleapis.com/compute/projects/myproject/regions/us-east-1/instanceGroupManagers/instance-group AND origin = 35678234`
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of TagHolds to return in the response. The server allows a maximum of 300 TagHolds to return. If unspecified, the server will use 100 as the default.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A pagination token returned from a previous call to `ListTagHolds` that indicates where this listing should continue from.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The ListTagHolds response.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Pagination token. If the result set is too large to fit in a single response, this token is returned. It encodes the position of the current result cursor. Feeding this value into a new list request with the `page_token` parameter gives the next page of the results. When `next_page_token` is not filled in, there is no next page and the list returned is the last page in the result set. Pagination tokens have a limited lifetime.
  &quot;tagHolds&quot;: [ # A possibly paginated list of TagHolds.
    { # A TagHold represents the use of a TagValue that is not captured by TagBindings. If a TagValue has any TagHolds, deletion will be blocked. This resource is intended to be created in the same cloud location as the `holder`.
      &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time this TagHold was created.
      &quot;helpLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A URL where an end user can learn more about removing this hold. E.g. `https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/tags/tags-creating-and-managing`
      &quot;holder&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the resource where the TagValue is being used. Must be less than 200 characters. E.g. `//compute.googleapis.com/compute/projects/myproject/regions/us-east-1/instanceGroupManagers/instance-group`
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of a TagHold. This is a String of the form: `tagValues/{tag-value-id}/tagHolds/{tag-hold-id}` (e.g. `tagValues/123/tagHolds/456`). This resource name is generated by the server.
      &quot;origin&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An optional string representing the origin of this request. This field should include human-understandable information to distinguish origins from each other. Must be less than 200 characters. E.g. `migs-35678234`

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
