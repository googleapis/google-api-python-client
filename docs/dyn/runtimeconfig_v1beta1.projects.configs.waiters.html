  <pre>Creates a Waiter resource. This operation returns a long-running Operation
resource which can be polled for completion. However, a waiter with the
given name will exist (and can be retrieved) prior to the operation
completing. If the operation fails, the failed Waiter resource will
still exist and must be deleted prior to subsequent creation attempts.

Args:
  parent: string, The path to the configuration that will own the waiter.
The configuration must exist beforehand; the path must by in the format:

`projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME]`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Waiter resource waits for some end condition within a RuntimeConfig resource
      # to be met before it returns. For example, assume you have a distributed
      # system where each node writes to a Variable resource indidicating the node's

      # 
      # You then configure a Waiter resource with the success condition set to wait
      # until some number of nodes have checked in. Afterwards, your application
      # runs some arbitrary code after the condition has been met and the waiter
      # returns successfully.
      #

        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There will be a
          # common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {
          "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
    },
    "createTime": "A String", # [Output Only] The instant at which this Waiter resource was created. Adding
        # the value of `timeout` to this instant yields the timeout deadline for the
        # waiter.
  }

  requestId: string, An optional but recommended unique `request_id`. If the server
receives two `create()` requests  with the same
`request_id`, then the second request will be ignored and the
first resource created and stored in the backend is returned.
Empty `request_id` fields are ignored.

It is responsibility of the client to ensure uniqueness of the
`request_id` strings.

`request_id` strings are limited to 64 characters.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

          #
          # # Overview
          #
          # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
          # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
          # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
          # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
          # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
          # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
          # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
          # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
          # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
          #
          # # Language mapping
          #
          # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
          # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
          # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
          # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
          # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
          #
          # # Other uses
          #
          # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
          # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
          # consistent developer experience across different environments.
          #
          # Example uses of this error model include:
          #
          # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
          #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
          #     errors.
          #
          # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
          #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
          #
          # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
          #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
          #     each error sub-response.
          #
          # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
          #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
          #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
          #
          # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
          #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
        "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
            # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
            # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
        "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
