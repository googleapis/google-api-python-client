    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a Waiter resource. This operation returns a long-running Operation
resource which can be polled for completion. However, a waiter with the
given name will exist (and can be retrieved) prior to the operation
completing. If the operation fails, the failed Waiter resource will
still exist and must be deleted prior to subsequent creation attempts.

Args:
  parent: string, The path to the configuration that will own the waiter.
The configuration must exist beforehand; the path must be in the format:

`projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME]`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Waiter resource waits for some end condition within a RuntimeConfig
      # resource to be met before it returns. For example, assume you have a
      # distributed system where each node writes to a Variable resource indicating
      # the node's readiness as part of the startup process.
      # 
      # You then configure a Waiter resource with the success condition set to wait
      # until some number of nodes have checked in. Afterwards, your application
      # runs some arbitrary code after the condition has been met and the waiter
      # returns successfully.
      # 
      # Once created, a Waiter resource is immutable.
      # 
      # To learn more about using waiters, read the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
  }</pre>
