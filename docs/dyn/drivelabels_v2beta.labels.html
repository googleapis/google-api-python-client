By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset.

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # The color of the badge.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, useAdminAccess=None, writeControl_requiredRevisionId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Permanently deletes a Label and related metadata on Drive Items. Once deleted, the Label and related Drive item metadata will be deleted. Only draft Labels, and disabled Labels may be deleted.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Label resource name. (required)
  useAdminAccess: boolean, Set to `true` in order to use the user&#x27;s admin credentials. The server will verify the user is an admin for the Label before allowing access.
  writeControl_requiredRevisionId: string, The revision_id of the label that the write request will be applied to. If this is not the latest revision of the label, the request will not be processed and will return a 400 Bad Request error.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delta">delta(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates a single Label by applying a set of update requests resulting in a new draft revision. The batch update is all-or-nothing: If any of the update requests are invalid, no changes are applied. The resulting draft revision must be published before the changes may be used with Drive Items.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the Label to update. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # The color of the badge.

  <pre>List labels.

Args:
  customer: string, The customer to scope this list request to. For example: &quot;customers/abcd1234&quot;. If unset, will return all labels within the current customer.
  languageCode: string, The BCP-47 language code to use for evaluating localized field labels. When not specified, values in the default configured language are used.
  minimumRole: string, Specifies the level of access the user must have on the returned Labels. The minimum role a user must have on a label. Defaults to `READER`.
    Allowed values
      LABEL_ROLE_UNSPECIFIED - Unknown role.
      READER - A reader can read the label and associated metadata applied to Drive items.
      APPLIER - An applier can write associated metadata on Drive items in which they also have write access to. Implies `READER`.
      ORGANIZER - An organizer can pin this label in shared drives they manage and add new appliers to the label.
      EDITOR - Editors can make any update including deleting the label which also deletes the associated Drive item metadata. Implies `APPLIER`.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of labels to return per page. Default: 50. Max: 200.
  pageToken: string, The token of the page to return.
  publishedOnly: boolean, Whether to include only published labels in the results. * When `true`, only the current published label revisions are returned. Disabled labels are included. Returned label resource names reference the published revision (`labels/{id}/{revision_id}`). * When `false`, the current label revisions are returned, which might not be published. Returned label resource names don&#x27;t reference a specific revision (`labels/{id}`).
  useAdminAccess: boolean, Set to `true` in order to use the user&#x27;s admin credentials. This will return all Labels within the customer.
  view: string, When specified, only certain fields belonging to the indicated view are returned.
    Allowed values
      LABEL_VIEW_BASIC - Implies the field mask: `name,id,revision_id,label_type,properties.*`
      LABEL_VIEW_FULL - All possible fields.

This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
        </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="publish">publish(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Publish all draft changes to the Label. Once published, the Label may not return to its draft state. See `google.apps.drive.labels.v2.Lifecycle` for more information. Publishing a Label will result in a new published revision. All previous draft revisions will be deleted. Previous published revisions will be kept but are subject to automated deletion as needed. Once published, some changes are no longer permitted. Generally, any change that would invalidate or cause new restrictions on existing metadata related to the Label will be rejected. For example, the following changes to a Label will be rejected after the Label is published: * The label cannot be directly deleted. It must be disabled first, then deleted. * Field.FieldType cannot be changed. * Changes to Field validation options cannot reject something that was previously accepted. * Reducing the max entries.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Label resource name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # The color of the badge. When not specified, no badge is rendered. The background, foreground, and solo (light and dark mode) colors set here are changed in the Drive UI into the closest recommended supported color.
                  &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset.

  <pre>Updates a Label&#x27;s permissions. If a permission for the indicated principal doesn&#x27;t exist, a new Label Permission is created, otherwise the existing permission is updated. Permissions affect the Label resource as a whole, are not revisioned, and do not require publishing.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent Label resource name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The permission that applies to a principal (user, group, audience) on a label.
  &quot;audience&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Audience to grant a role to. The magic value of `audiences/default` may be used to apply the role to the default audience in the context of the organization that owns the Label.
  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the email address for a user or group pricinpal. Not populated for audience principals. User and Group permissions may only be inserted using email address. On update requests, if email address is specified, no principal should be specified.
  &quot;group&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Group resource name.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name of this permission.
  &quot;person&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Person resource name.
  &quot;role&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The role the principal should have.
}

  useAdminAccess: boolean, Set to `true` in order to use the user&#x27;s admin credentials. The server will verify the user is an admin for the Label before allowing access.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The permission that applies to a principal (user, group, audience) on a label.
  &quot;audience&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Audience to grant a role to. The magic value of `audiences/default` may be used to apply the role to the default audience in the context of the organization that owns the Label.
  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the email address for a user or group pricinpal. Not populated for audience principals. User and Group permissions may only be inserted using email address. On update requests, if email address is specified, no principal should be specified.
  &quot;group&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Group resource name.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name of this permission.
  &quot;person&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Person resource name.
  &quot;role&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The role the principal should have.
