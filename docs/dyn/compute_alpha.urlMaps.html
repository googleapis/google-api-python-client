<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of UrlMap resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Contains a list of UrlMap resources.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="validate">validate(project, urlMap, body)</code>
  <pre>Runs static validation for the UrlMap. In particular, the tests of the provided UrlMap will be run. Calling this method does NOT create the UrlMap.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  urlMap: string, Name of the UrlMap resource to be validated as. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "resource": { # A UrlMap resource. This resource defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService resource, based on the "longest-match" of the URL's host and path. # Content of the UrlMap to be validated.
        "kind": "compute#urlMap", # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#urlMaps for url maps.
        "description": "A String", # An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
        "defaultService": "A String", # The URL of the BackendService resource if none of the hostRules match.
        "tests": [ # The list of expected URL mappings. Request to update this UrlMap will succeed only if all of the test cases pass.
          { # Message for the expected URL mappings.

        "selfLink": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
        "fingerprint": "A String", # Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when inserting a UrlMap. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the UrlMap.
        "pathMatchers": [ # The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL.
          { # A matcher for the path portion of the URL. The BackendService from the longest-matched rule will serve the URL. If no rule was matched, the default service will be used.
            "defaultService": "A String", # The full or partial URL to the BackendService resource. This will be used if none of the pathRules defined by this PathMatcher is matched by the URL's path portion. For example, the following are all valid URLs to a BackendService resource:

        "hostRules": [ # The list of HostRules to use against the URL.
          { # UrlMaps A host-matching rule for a URL. If matched, will use the named PathMatcher to select the BackendService.
            "hosts": [ # The list of host patterns to match. They must be valid hostnames, except * will match any string of ([a-z0-9-.]*). In that case, * must be the first character and must be followed in the pattern by either - or ..

        "name": "A String", # Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
