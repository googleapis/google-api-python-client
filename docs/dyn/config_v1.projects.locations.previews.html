If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Previews in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent in whose context the Previews are listed. The parent value is in the format: &#x27;projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}&#x27;. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Lists the Deployments that match the filter expression. A filter expression filters the resources listed in the response. The expression must be of the form &#x27;{field} {operator} {value}&#x27; where operators: &#x27;&lt;&#x27;, &#x27;&gt;&#x27;, &#x27;&lt;=&#x27;, &#x27;&gt;=&#x27;, &#x27;!=&#x27;, &#x27;=&#x27;, &#x27;:&#x27; are supported (colon &#x27;:&#x27; represents a HAS operator which is roughly synonymous with equality). {field} can refer to a proto or JSON field, or a synthetic field. Field names can be camelCase or snake_case. Examples: - Filter by name: name = &quot;projects/foo/locations/us-central1/deployments/bar - Filter by labels: - Resources that have a key called &#x27;foo&#x27; labels.foo:* - Resources that have a key called &#x27;foo&#x27; whose value is &#x27;bar&#x27; labels.foo = bar - Filter by state: - Deployments in CREATING state. state=CREATING
  orderBy: string, Optional. Field to use to sort the list.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. When requesting a page of resources, &#x27;page_size&#x27; specifies number of resources to return. If unspecified, at most 500 will be returned. The maximum value is 1000.
  pageToken: string, Optional. Token returned by previous call to &#x27;ListDeployments&#x27; which specifies the position in the list from where to continue listing the resources.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
