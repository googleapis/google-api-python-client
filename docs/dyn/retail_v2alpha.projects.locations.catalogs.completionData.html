The operation is successfully finished only after the imported suggestions are indexed successfully and ready for serving. The process takes hours. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Enable Retail Search on Cloud Console before using this feature.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The catalog which the suggestions dataset belongs to. Format: `projects/1234/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for ImportCompletionData methods.
  &quot;inputConfig&quot;: { # The input config source for completion data. # Required. The desired input location of the data.
    &quot;bigQuerySource&quot;: { # BigQuery source import data from. # Required. BigQuery input source. Add the IAM permission &quot;BigQuery Data Viewer&quot; for cloud-retail-customer-data-access@system.gserviceaccount.com before using this feature otherwise an error is thrown.
      &quot;dataSchema&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The schema to use when parsing the data from the source. Supported values for product imports: * `product` (default): One JSON Product per line. Each product must have a valid Product.id. * `product_merchant_center`: See [Importing catalog data from Merchant Center](https://cloud.google.com/retail/recommendations-ai/docs/upload-catalog#mc). Supported values for user events imports: * `user_event` (default): One JSON UserEvent per line. * `user_event_ga360`: The schema is available here: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719. * `user_event_ga4`: The schema is available here: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7029846. Supported values for autocomplete imports: * `suggestions` (default): One JSON completion suggestion per line. * `denylist`: One JSON deny suggestion per line. * `allowlist`: One JSON allow suggestion per line.
      &quot;datasetId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The BigQuery data set to copy the data from with a length limit of 1,024 characters.
      &quot;gcsStagingDir&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Intermediate Cloud Storage directory used for the import with a length limit of 2,000 characters. Can be specified if one wants to have the BigQuery export to a specific Cloud Storage directory.
      &quot;partitionDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, such as a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are insignificant. The date is relative to the Gregorian Calendar. This can represent one of the following: * A full date, with non-zero year, month, and day values. * A month and day, with a zero year (for example, an anniversary). * A year on its own, with a zero month and a zero day. * A year and month, with a zero day (for example, a credit card expiration date). Related types: * google.type.TimeOfDay * google.type.DateTime * google.protobuf.Timestamp # BigQuery time partitioned table&#x27;s _PARTITIONDATE in YYYY-MM-DD format. Only supported in ImportProductsRequest.
        &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn&#x27;t significant.
        &quot;month&quot;: 42, # Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day.
        &quot;year&quot;: 42, # Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without a year.
      },
      &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The project ID (can be project # or ID) that the BigQuery source is in with a length limit of 128 characters. If not specified, inherits the project ID from the parent request.
      &quot;tableId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The BigQuery table to copy the data from with a length limit of 1,024 characters.
    },
  },
  &quot;notificationPubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Pub/Sub topic for receiving notification. If this field is set, when the import is finished, a notification is sent to specified Pub/Sub topic. The message data is JSON string of a Operation. Format of the Pub/Sub topic is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
