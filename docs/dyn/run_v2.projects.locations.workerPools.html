Cloud Run supports `ALPHA`, `BETA`, and `GA`. If no value is specified, GA is assumed. Set the launch stage to a preview stage on input to allow use of preview features in that stage. On read (or output), describes whether the resource uses preview features. For example, if ALPHA is provided as input, but only BETA and GA-level features are used, this field will be BETA on output.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The fully qualified name of this WorkerPool. In CreateWorkerPoolRequest, this field is ignored, and instead composed from CreateWorkerPoolRequest.parent and CreateWorkerPoolRequest.worker_id.

  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Returns true if the WorkerPool is currently being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state. When a new WorkerPool is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the WorkerPool to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation`, `latest_ready_revison`, `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the serving state matches the WorkerPool, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in `terminal_condition.state`. If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: `traffic` and `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation` and `generation`, `latest_ready_revision` and `latest_created_revision`. If reconciliation failed, `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation`, and `latest_ready_revision` will have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for newly created WorkerPools. Additional information on the failure can be found in `terminal_condition` and `conditions`.

    &quot;maxSurge&quot;: 42, # Optional. A maximum percentage of instances that will be moved in each step of traffic split changes. When set to a positive value, the server will bring up, at most, that percentage of new instances at a time before moving traffic to them. After moving traffic, the server will bring down instances of the old revision. This can reduce a spike of total active instances during changes from one revision to another but specifying how many extra instances can be brought up at a time.
    &quot;maxUnavailable&quot;: 42, # Optional. A maximum percentage of instances that may be unavailable during changes from one revision to another. When set to a positive value, the server may bring down instances before bringing up new instances. This can prevent a spike of total active instances during changes from one revision by reducing the pool of instances before bringing up new ones. Some requests may be slow or fail to serve during the transition.
    &quot;minInstanceCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The minimum count of instances distributed among revisions based on the specified instance split percentages.
    &quot;scalingMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The scaling mode for the worker pool.

  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Returns true if the WorkerPool is currently being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state. When a new WorkerPool is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the WorkerPool to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation`, `latest_ready_revison`, `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the serving state matches the WorkerPool, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in `terminal_condition.state`. If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: `traffic` and `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation` and `generation`, `latest_ready_revision` and `latest_created_revision`. If reconciliation failed, `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation`, and `latest_ready_revision` will have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for newly created WorkerPools. Additional information on the failure can be found in `terminal_condition` and `conditions`.

For chmod 755 (u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx), set to 0755 (octal) or 493 (base-10). * This might be in conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set.

When a new WorkerPool is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the WorkerPool to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation`, `latest_ready_revison`, `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the serving state matches the WorkerPool, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in `terminal_condition.state`. If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: `traffic` and `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation` and `generation`, `latest_ready_revision` and `latest_created_revision`. If reconciliation failed, `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation`, and `latest_ready_revision` will have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for newly created WorkerPools. Additional information on the failure can be found in `terminal_condition` and `conditions`.

As with most Google APIs, its JSON representation will be a `string` instead of an `integer`.
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Returns true if the WorkerPool is currently being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state. When a new WorkerPool is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the WorkerPool to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation`, `latest_ready_revison`, `traffic_statuses`, and `uri` will have transient values that might mismatch the intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the serving state matches the WorkerPool, or there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in `terminal_condition.state`. If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will match: `traffic` and `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation` and `generation`, `latest_ready_revision` and `latest_created_revision`. If reconciliation failed, `traffic_statuses`, `observed_generation`, and `latest_ready_revision` will have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for newly created WorkerPools. Additional information on the failure can be found in `terminal_condition` and `conditions`.

When set to a positive value, the server may bring down instances before bringing up new instances.
