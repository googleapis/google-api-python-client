  <pre>Gets an entry by its target resource name. The resource name comes from the source Google Cloud Platform service.

Args:
  fullyQualifiedName: string, Fully qualified name (FQN) of the resource. FQNs take two forms: * For non-regionalized resources: `{SYSTEM}:{PROJECT}.{PATH_TO_RESOURCE_SEPARATED_WITH_DOTS}` * For regionalized resources: `{SYSTEM}:{PROJECT}.{LOCATION_ID}.{PATH_TO_RESOURCE_SEPARATED_WITH_DOTS}` Example for a DPMS table: `dataproc_metastore:{PROJECT_ID}.{LOCATION_ID}.{INSTANCE_ID}.{DATABASE_ID}.{TABLE_ID}`
  linkedResource: string, The full name of the Google Cloud Platform resource the Data Catalog entry represents. For more information, see [Full Resource Name] (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name). Full names are case-sensitive. For example: * `//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/tables/{TABLE_ID}` * `//pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/topics/{TOPIC_ID}`
  sqlResource: string, The SQL name of the entry. SQL names are case-sensitive. Examples: * `pubsub.topic.{PROJECT_ID}.{TOPIC_ID}` * `pubsub.topic.{PROJECT_ID}.`\``{TOPIC.ID.SEPARATED.WITH.DOTS}`\` * `bigquery.table.{PROJECT_ID}.{DATASET_ID}.{TABLE_ID}` * `bigquery.dataset.{PROJECT_ID}.{DATASET_ID}` * `datacatalog.entry.{PROJECT_ID}.{LOCATION_ID}.{ENTRY_GROUP_ID}.{ENTRY_ID}` Identifiers (`*_ID`) should comply with the [Lexical structure in Standard SQL] (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Entry metadata. A Data Catalog entry represents another resource in Google Cloud Platform (such as a BigQuery dataset or a Pub/Sub topic) or outside of it. You can use the `linked_resource` field in the entry resource to refer to the original resource ID of the source system. An entry resource contains resource details, for example, its schema.
