This flag indicates that this Runnable must be run even if the Task has already failed. This is useful for Runnables that copy output files off of the VM or for debugging. The always_run flag does not override the Task&#x27;s overall max_run_duration. If the max_run_duration has expired then no further Runnables will execute, not even always_run Runnables.

Background runnables are allowed continue running in the background while the task executes subsequent runnables. For example, background runnables are useful for providing services to other runnables or providing debugging-support tools like SSH servers. Specifically, background runnables are killed automatically (if they have not already exited) a short time after all foreground runnables have completed. Even though this is likely to result in a non-zero exit status for the background runnable, these automatic kills are not treated as task failures.

When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container runtime is [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker. Additionally, this container runnable only supports the following `container` subfields: `imageUri`, `commands[]`, `entrypoint`, and `volumes[]`; any other `container` subfields are ignored.

When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container runtime is [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker. Additionally, this container runnable only supports the following `container` subfields: `imageUri`, `commands[]`, `entrypoint`, and `volumes[]`; any other `container` subfields are ignored.

  reason: string, Optional. Reason for this deletion.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Format the value of this field as a time limit in seconds followed by `s`—for example, `3600s` for 1 hour. The field accepts any value between 0 and the maximum listed for the `Duration` field type at https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#duration; however, the actual maximum run time for a job will be limited to the maximum run time for a job listed at https://cloud.google.com/batch/quotas#max-job-duration.
        &quot;runnables&quot;: [ # Required. The sequence of one or more runnables (executable scripts, executable containers, and/or barriers) for each task in this task group to run. Each task runs this list of runnables in order. For a task to succeed, all of its script and container runnables each must meet at least one of the following conditions: + The runnable exited with a zero status. + The runnable didn&#x27;t finish, but you enabled its `background` subfield. + The runnable exited with a non-zero status, but you enabled its `ignore_exit_status` subfield.

            &quot;alwaysRun&quot;: True or False, # By default, after a Runnable fails, no further Runnable are executed. This flag indicates that this Runnable must be run even if the Task has already failed. This is useful for Runnables that copy output files off of the VM or for debugging. The always_run flag does not override the Task&#x27;s overall max_run_duration. If the max_run_duration has expired then no further Runnables will execute, not even always_run Runnables.
            &quot;background&quot;: True or False, # Normally, a runnable that doesn&#x27;t exit causes its task to fail. However, you can set this field to `true` to configure a background runnable. Background runnables are allowed continue running in the background while the task executes subsequent runnables. For example, background runnables are useful for providing services to other runnables or providing debugging-support tools like SSH servers. Specifically, background runnables are killed automatically (if they have not already exited) a short time after all foreground runnables have completed. Even though this is likely to result in a non-zero exit status for the background runnable, these automatic kills are not treated as task failures.
            &quot;barrier&quot;: { # A barrier runnable automatically blocks the execution of subsequent runnables until all the tasks in the task group reach the barrier. # Barrier runnable.

Use Image streaming to allow the runnable to initialize without waiting for the entire container image to download, which can significantly reduce startup time for large container images. When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container runtime is [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker. Additionally, this container runnable only supports the following `container` subfields: `imageUri`, `commands[]`, `entrypoint`, and `volumes[]`; any other `container` subfields are ignored. For more information about the requirements and limitations for using Image streaming with Batch, see the [`image-streaming` sample on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/batch-samples/tree/main/api-samples/image-streaming).

For security, it is strongly recommended to specify an encrypted password by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. Warning: If you specify the password using plain text, you risk the password being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the password instead. Learn more about [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [using Secret Manager with Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/create-run-job-secret-manager).

You can either specify the username directly by using plain text or specify an encrypted username by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. However, using a secret is recommended for enhanced security. Caution: If you specify the username using plain text, you risk the username being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the username instead.

If the `TaskSpec.Volumes` field is specified but this field is not, Batch will mount each volume from the host machine to the container with the same mount path by default. In this case, the default mount option for containers will be read-only (`ro`) for existing persistent disks and read-write (`rw`) for other volume types, regardless of the original mount options specified in `TaskSpec.Volumes`. If you need different mount settings, you can explicitly configure them in this field.

                  &quot;options&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required for some container images. Arbitrary additional options to include in the `docker run` command when running this container—for example, `--network host`. For the `--volume` option, use the `volumes` field for the container.
                  &quot;password&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required if the container image is from a private Docker registry. The password to login to the Docker registry that contains the image. For security, it is strongly recommended to specify an encrypted password by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. Warning: If you specify the password using plain text, you risk the password being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the password instead.

                  &quot;username&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required if the container image is from a private Docker registry. The username to login to the Docker registry that contains the image. You can either specify the username directly by using plain text or specify an encrypted username by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. However, using a secret is recommended for enhanced security. Caution: If you specify the username using plain text, you risk the username being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the username instead.

If the `TaskSpec.Volumes` field is specified but this field is not, Batch will mount each volume from the host machine to the container with the same mount path by default. In this case, the default mount option for containers will be read-only (`ro`) for existing persistent disks and read-write (`rw`) for other volume types, regardless of the original mount options specified in `TaskSpec.Volumes`. If you need different mount settings, you can explicitly configure them in this field.
