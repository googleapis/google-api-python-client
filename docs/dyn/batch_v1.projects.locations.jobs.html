Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource name where the Job will be created. Pattern: &quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}&quot; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

        &quot;blockProjectSshKeys&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Set this field to `true` if you want Batch to block project-level SSH keys from accessing this job&#x27;s VMs. Alternatively, you can configure the job to specify a VM instance template that blocks project-level SSH keys. In either case, Batch blocks project-level SSH keys while creating the VMs for this job. Batch allows project-level SSH keys for a job&#x27;s VMs only if all the following are true: + This field is undefined or set to `false`. + The job&#x27;s VM instance template (if any) doesn&#x27;t block project-level SSH keys. Notably, you can override this behavior by manually updating a VM to block or allow project-level SSH keys. For more information about blocking project-level SSH keys, see the Compute Engine documentation: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/restrict-ssh-keys#block-keys

        &quot;instanceTemplate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of an instance template used to create VMs. Named the field as &#x27;instance_template&#x27; instead of &#x27;template&#x27; to avoid C++ keyword conflict. Batch only supports global instance templates. You can specify the global instance template as a full or partial URL.

If the `type` specifies a local SSD, this field should be a multiple of 375 GB, otherwise, the final size will be the next greater multiple of 375 GB. **Boot Disk**: Batch will calculate the boot disk size based on source image and task requirements if you do not speicify the size. If both this field and the `boot_disk_mib` field in task spec&#x27;s `compute_resource` are defined, Batch will only honor this field. Also, this field should be no smaller than the source disk&#x27;s size when the `data_source` is set as `snapshot` or `image`. For example, if you set an image as the `data_source` field and the image&#x27;s default disk size 30 GB, you can only use this field to make the disk larger or equal to 30 GB.
              &quot;snapshot&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of a snapshot used as the data source. Snapshot is not supported as boot disk now.

Persistent disks and boot disks use &quot;pd-balanced&quot;, &quot;pd-extreme&quot;, &quot;pd-ssd&quot; or &quot;pd-standard&quot;. If not specified, &quot;pd-standard&quot; will be used as the default type for non-boot disks, &quot;pd-balanced&quot; will be used as the default type for boot disks.

This flag indicates that this Runnable must be run even if the Task has already failed. This is useful for Runnables that copy output files off of the VM or for debugging. The always_run flag does not override the Task&#x27;s overall max_run_duration. If the max_run_duration has expired then no further Runnables will execute, not even always_run Runnables.

Background runnables are allowed continue running in the background while the task executes subsequent runnables. For example, background runnables are useful for providing services to other runnables or providing debugging-support tools like SSH servers. Specifically, background runnables are killed automatically (if they have not already exited) a short time after all foreground runnables have completed. Even though this is likely to result in a non-zero exit status for the background runnable, these automatic kills are not treated as task failures.

Use Image streaming to allow the runnable to initialize without waiting for the entire container image to download, which can significantly reduce startup time for large container images. When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container runtime is [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker. Additionally, this container runnable only supports the following `container` subfields: `imageUri`, `commands[]`, `entrypoint`, and `volumes[]`; any other `container` subfields are ignored.

Warning: If you specify the password using plain text, you risk the password being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the password instead.

You can either specify the username directly by using plain text or specify an encrypted username by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. However, using a secret is recommended for enhanced security. Caution: If you specify the username using plain text, you risk the username being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs.

If the `TaskSpec.Volumes` field is specified but this field is not, Batch will mount each volume from the host machine to the container with the same mount path by default. In this case, the default mount option for containers will be read-only (`ro`) for existing persistent disks and read-write (`rw`) for other volume types, regardless of the original mount options specified in `TaskSpec.Volumes`. If you need different mount settings, you can explicitly configure them in this field.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container runtime is [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker. Additionally, this container runnable only supports the following `container` subfields: `imageUri`, `commands[]`, `entrypoint`, and `volumes[]`; any other `container` subfields are ignored.

The field accepts any value between 0 and the maximum listed for the `Duration` field type at https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#duration; however, the actual maximum run time for a job will be limited to the maximum run time for a job listed at https://cloud.google.com/batch/quotas#max-job-duration.

This flag indicates that this Runnable must be run even if the Task has already failed. This is useful for Runnables that copy output files off of the VM or for debugging. The always_run flag does not override the Task&#x27;s overall max_run_duration. If the max_run_duration has expired then no further Runnables will execute, not even always_run Runnables.

Background runnables are allowed continue running in the background while the task executes subsequent runnables. For example, background runnables are useful for providing services to other runnables or providing debugging-support tools like SSH servers. Specifically, background runnables are killed automatically (if they have not already exited) a short time after all foreground runnables have completed. Even though this is likely to result in a non-zero exit status for the background runnable, these automatic kills are not treated as task failures.

Use Image streaming to allow the runnable to initialize without waiting for the entire container image to download, which can significantly reduce startup time for large container images. When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container runtime is [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker. Additionally, this container runnable only supports the following `container` subfields: `imageUri`, `commands[]`, `entrypoint`, and `volumes[]`; any other `container` subfields are ignored.

For security, it is strongly recommended to specify an encrypted password by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. Warning: If you specify the password using plain text, you risk the password being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the password instead.

You can either specify the username directly by using plain text or specify an encrypted username by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. However, using a secret is recommended for enhanced security. Caution: If you specify the username using plain text, you risk the username being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs.

If the `TaskSpec.Volumes` field is specified but this field is not, Batch will mount each volume from the host machine to the container with the same mount path by default. In this case, the default mount option for containers will be read-only (`ro`) for existing persistent disks and read-write (`rw`) for other volume types, regardless of the original mount options specified in `TaskSpec.Volumes`. If you need different mount settings, you can explicitly configure them in this field.

            &quot;runnables&quot;: [ # Required. The sequence of one or more runnables (executable scripts, executable containers, and/or barriers) for each task in this task group to run. Each task runs this list of runnables in order. For a task to succeed, all of its script and container runnables each must meet at least one of the following conditions: + The runnable exited with a zero status. + The runnable didn&#x27;t finish, but you enabled its `background` subfield. + The runnable exited with a non-zero status, but you enabled its `ignore_exit_status` subfield.
              { # Runnable describes instructions for executing a specific script or container as part of a Task.
                &quot;alwaysRun&quot;: True or False, # By default, after a Runnable fails, no further Runnable are executed. This flag indicates that this Runnable must be run even if the Task has already failed. This is useful for Runnables that copy output files off of the VM or for debugging. The always_run flag does not override the Task&#x27;s overall max_run_duration. If the max_run_duration has expired then no further Runnables will execute, not even always_run Runnables.
                &quot;background&quot;: True or False, # Normally, a runnable that doesn&#x27;t exit causes its task to fail. However, you can set this field to `true` to configure a background runnable. Background runnables are allowed continue running in the background while the task executes subsequent runnables. For example, background runnables are useful for providing services to other runnables or providing debugging-support tools like SSH servers. Specifically, background runnables are killed automatically (if they have not already exited) a short time after all foreground runnables have completed. Even though this is likely to result in a non-zero exit status for the background runnable, these automatic kills are not treated as task failures.
                &quot;barrier&quot;: { # A barrier runnable automatically blocks the execution of subsequent runnables until all the tasks in the task group reach the barrier. # Barrier runnable.
                  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Barriers are identified by their index in runnable list. Names are not required, but if present should be an identifier.
                },
                &quot;container&quot;: { # Container runnable. # Container runnable.
                  &quot;blockExternalNetwork&quot;: True or False, # If set to true, external network access to and from container will be blocked, containers that are with block_external_network as true can still communicate with each other, network cannot be specified in the `container.options` field.
                  &quot;commands&quot;: [ # Required for some container images. Overrides the `CMD` specified in the container. If there is an `ENTRYPOINT` (either in the container image or with the `entrypoint` field below) then these commands are appended as arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT`.
                    &quot;A String&quot;,
                  ],
                  &quot;enableImageStreaming&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If set to true, this container runnable uses Image streaming. Use Image streaming to allow the runnable to initialize without waiting for the entire container image to download, which can significantly reduce startup time for large container images. When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container runtime is [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker. Additionally, this container runnable only supports the following `container` subfields: `imageUri`, `commands[]`, `entrypoint`, and `volumes[]`; any other `container` subfields are ignored. For more information about the requirements and limitations for using Image streaming with Batch, see the [`image-streaming` sample on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/batch-samples/tree/main/api-samples/image-streaming).
                  &quot;entrypoint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required for some container images. Overrides the `ENTRYPOINT` specified in the container.
                  &quot;imageUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The URI to pull the container image from.
                  &quot;options&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required for some container images. Arbitrary additional options to include in the `docker run` command when running this container—for example, `--network host`. For the `--volume` option, use the `volumes` field for the container.
                  &quot;password&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required if the container image is from a private Docker registry. The password to login to the Docker registry that contains the image. For security, it is strongly recommended to specify an encrypted password by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. Warning: If you specify the password using plain text, you risk the password being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the password instead. Learn more about [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [using Secret Manager with Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/create-run-job-secret-manager).
                  &quot;username&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required if the container image is from a private Docker registry. The username to login to the Docker registry that contains the image. You can either specify the username directly by using plain text or specify an encrypted username by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. However, using a secret is recommended for enhanced security. Caution: If you specify the username using plain text, you risk the username being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the username instead.

                  &quot;volumes&quot;: [ # Volumes to mount (bind mount) from the host machine files or directories into the container, formatted to match `--volume` option for the `docker run` command—for example, `/foo:/bar` or `/foo:/bar:ro`. If the `TaskSpec.Volumes` field is specified but this field is not, Batch will mount each volume from the host machine to the container with the same mount path by default. In this case, the default mount option for containers will be read-only (`ro`) for existing persistent disks and read-write (`rw`) for other volume types, regardless of the original mount options specified in `TaskSpec.Volumes`. If you need different mount settings, you can explicitly configure them in this field.

                },
                &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. DisplayName is an optional field that can be provided by the caller. If provided, it will be used in logs and other outputs to identify the script, making it easier for users to understand the logs. If not provided the index of the runnable will be used for outputs.
                &quot;environment&quot;: { # An Environment describes a collection of environment variables to set when executing Tasks. # Environment variables for this Runnable (overrides variables set for the whole Task or TaskGroup).
