  },
  &quot;networkMatch&quot;: { # Represents a match condition that incoming network traffic is evaluated against. # A match condition that incoming packets are evaluated against for CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK security policies. If it matches, the corresponding &#x27;action&#x27; is enforced. The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like &#x27;srcIpRanges&#x27;) and potentially multiple user-defined match fields (&#x27;userDefinedFields&#x27;). Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. &#x27;srcRegionCodes&#x27;). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. &#x27;srcPorts&#x27;). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it&#x27;s not required to be present. For strings specifying &#x27;*&#x27; is also equivalent to match all. For a packet to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding field values derived from the packet. Example: networkMatch: srcIpRanges: - &quot;192.0.2.0/24&quot; - &quot;198.51.100.0/24&quot; userDefinedFields: - name: &quot;ipv4_fragment_offset&quot; values: - &quot;1-0x1fff&quot; The above match condition matches packets with a source IP in 192.0.2.0/24 or 198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named &quot;ipv4_fragment_offset&quot; with a value between 1 and 0x1fff inclusive.

    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, filter=None, includeAllScopes=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of all SecurityPolicy resources, regional and global, available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Name of the project scoping this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  includeAllScopes: boolean, Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like &#x27;srcIpRanges&#x27;) and potentially multiple user-defined match fields (&#x27;userDefinedFields&#x27;). Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. &#x27;srcRegionCodes&#x27;). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. &#x27;srcPorts&#x27;). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it&#x27;s not required to be present. For strings specifying &#x27;*&#x27; is also equivalent to match all. For a packet to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding field values derived from the packet.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(project, securityPolicy, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the specified policy.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  securityPolicy: string, Name of the security policy to delete. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like &#x27;srcIpRanges&#x27;) and potentially multiple user-defined match fields (&#x27;userDefinedFields&#x27;). Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. &#x27;srcRegionCodes&#x27;). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. &#x27;srcPorts&#x27;). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it&#x27;s not required to be present.

The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like &#x27;srcIpRanges&#x27;) and potentially multiple user-defined match fields (&#x27;userDefinedFields&#x27;). Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. &#x27;srcRegionCodes&#x27;). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. &#x27;srcPorts&#x27;). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it&#x27;s not required to be present. For strings specifying &#x27;*&#x27; is also equivalent to match all. For a packet to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding field values derived from the packet.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, If true, the request will not be committed.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>List all the policies that have been configured for the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like &#x27;srcIpRanges&#x27;) and potentially multiple user-defined match fields (&#x27;userDefinedFields&#x27;). Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. &#x27;srcRegionCodes&#x27;). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. &#x27;srcPorts&#x27;). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it&#x27;s not required to be present.

    <code class="details" id="listPreconfiguredExpressionSets">listPreconfiguredExpressionSets(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the current list of preconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF) expressions.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

If it matches, the corresponding &#x27;action&#x27; is enforced. The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like &#x27;srcIpRanges&#x27;) and potentially multiple user-defined match fields (&#x27;userDefinedFields&#x27;). Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. &#x27;srcRegionCodes&#x27;). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. &#x27;srcPorts&#x27;). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it&#x27;s not required to be present. For strings specifying &#x27;*&#x27; is also equivalent to match all. For a packet to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding field values derived from the packet.

  paths: string, A parameter (repeated)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Indicates fields to be cleared as part of this request.

The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like &#x27;srcIpRanges&#x27;) and potentially multiple user-defined match fields (&#x27;userDefinedFields&#x27;). Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. &#x27;srcRegionCodes&#x27;). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. &#x27;srcPorts&#x27;). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it&#x27;s not required to be present. For strings specifying &#x27;*&#x27; is also equivalent to match all. For a packet to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding field values derived from the packet.
