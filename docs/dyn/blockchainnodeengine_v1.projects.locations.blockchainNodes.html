}

  blockchainNodeId: string, Required. ID of the requesting object.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.

      &quot;executionClientPrometheusMetricsApiEndpoint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The assigned URL for the node&#x27;s execution client&#x27;s Prometheus metrics endpoint.
    },
    &quot;apiEnableAdmin&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Enables JSON-RPC access to functions in the `admin` namespace. Defaults to `false`.

      &quot;beaconFeeRecipient&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An Ethereum address which the beacon client will send fee rewards to if no recipient is configured in the validator client. See https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/suggested-fee-recipient.html or https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/execution-node/fee-recipient for examples of how this is used. Note that while this is often described as &quot;suggested&quot;, as we run the execution node we can trust the execution node, and therefore this is considered enforced.
      &quot;managedValidatorClient&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. When true, deploys a GCP-managed validator client alongside the beacon client.
      &quot;mevRelayUrls&quot;: [ # URLs for MEV-relay services to use for block building. When set, a GCP-managed MEV-boost service is configured on the beacon client.

      ],
    },
  },
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-provided key-value pairs.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,

  &quot;privateServiceConnectEnabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. When true, the node is only accessible via Private Service Connect; no public endpoints are exposed. Otherwise, the node is only accessible via public endpoints. Warning: Private Service Connect enabled nodes may require a manual migration effort to remain compatible with future versions of the product. If this feature is enabled, you will be notified of these changes along with any required action to avoid disruption. See https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A status representing the state of the node.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp at which the blockchain node was last updated.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Blockchain node resource by the update. The fields specified in the `update_mask` are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
