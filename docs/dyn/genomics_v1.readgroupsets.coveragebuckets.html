<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(readGroupSetId, targetBucketWidth=None, x__xgafv=None, end=None, start=None, referenceName=None, pageToken=None, pageSize=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists fixed width coverage buckets for a read group set, each of which
correspond to a range of a reference sequence. Each bucket summarizes
coverage information across its corresponding genomic range.

For the definitions of read group sets and other genomics resources, see
[Fundamentals of Google
Genomics](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/fundamentals-of-google-genomics)

Coverage is defined as the number of reads which are aligned to a given
base in the reference sequence. Coverage buckets are available at several
precomputed bucket widths, enabling retrieval of various coverage 'zoom
levels'. The caller must have READ permissions for the target read group
set.

Args:
  readGroupSetId: string, Required. The ID of the read group set over which coverage is requested. (required)
  targetBucketWidth: string, The desired width of each reported coverage bucket in base pairs. This
will be rounded down to the nearest precomputed bucket width; the value
of which is returned as `bucketWidth` in the response. Defaults
to infinity (each bucket spans an entire reference sequence) or the length
of the target range, if specified. The smallest precomputed
`bucketWidth` is currently 2048 base pairs; this is subject to
change.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  end: string, The end position of the range on the reference, 0-based exclusive. If
specified, `referenceName` must also be specified. If unset or 0, defaults
to the length of the reference.
  start: string, The start position of the range on the reference, 0-based inclusive. If
specified, `referenceName` must also be specified. Defaults to 0.
  referenceName: string, The name of the reference to query, within the reference set associated
with this query. Optional.
  pageToken: string, The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets.
To get the next page of results, set this parameter to the value of
`nextPageToken` from the previous response.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of results to return in a single page. If unspecified,
defaults to 1024. The maximum value is 2048.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets.
        # Provide this value in a subsequent request to return the next page of
        # results. This field will be empty if there aren't any additional results.
    "coverageBuckets": [ # The coverage buckets. The list of buckets is sparse; a bucket with 0
        # overlapping reads is not returned. A bucket never crosses more than one
        # reference sequence. Each bucket has width `bucketWidth`, unless
        # its end is the end of the reference sequence.
      { # A bucket over which read coverage has been precomputed. A bucket corresponds
          # to a specific range of the reference sequence.
        "meanCoverage": 3.14, # The average number of reads which are aligned to each individual
            # reference base in this bucket.
        "range": { # A 0-based half-open genomic coordinate range for search requests. # The genomic coordinate range spanned by this bucket.
          "start": "A String", # The start position of the range on the reference, 0-based inclusive.
          "end": "A String", # The end position of the range on the reference, 0-based exclusive.
          "referenceName": "A String", # The reference sequence name, for example `chr1`,
              # `1`, or `chrX`.
        },
      },
    ],
    "bucketWidth": "A String", # The length of each coverage bucket in base pairs. Note that buckets at the
        # end of a reference sequence may be shorter. This value is omitted if the
        # bucket width is infinity (the default behaviour, with no range or
        # `targetBucketWidth`).
  }</pre>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
