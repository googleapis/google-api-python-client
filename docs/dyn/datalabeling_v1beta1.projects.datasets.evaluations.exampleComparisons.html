  <pre>Searches example comparisons from an evaluation. The return format is a list of example comparisons that show ground truth and prediction(s) for a single input. Search by providing an evaluation ID.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the Evaluation resource to search for example comparisons from. Format: &quot;projects/{project_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/evaluations/ {evaluation_id}&quot; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message of SearchExampleComparisons.
  &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # Optional. Requested page size. Server may return fewer results than requested. Default value is 100.
  &quot;pageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A token identifying a page of results for the server to return. Typically obtained by the nextPageToken of the response to a previous search rquest. If you don&#x27;t specify this field, the API call requests the first page of the search.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
