<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body=None, validateOnly=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a TagBinding between a TagValue and a cloud resource (currently project, folder, or organization).

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A TagBinding represents a connection between a TagValue and a cloud resource (currently project, folder, or organization). Once a TagBinding is created, the TagValue is applied to all the descendants of the cloud resource.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the TagBinding. This is a String of the form: `tagBindings/{full-resource-name}/{tag-value-name}` (e.g. `tagBindings/%2F%2Fcloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2F123/tagValues/456`).
  &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full resource name of the resource the TagValue is bound to. E.g. `//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/123`
  &quot;tagValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The TagValue of the TagBinding. Must be of the form `tagValues/456`.
}

  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. Set to true to perform the validations necessary for creating the resource, but not actually perform the action.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(pageSize=None, pageToken=None, parent=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the TagBindings for the given cloud resource, as specified with `parent`. NOTE: The `parent` field is expected to be a full resource name: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name

Args:
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of TagBindings to return in the response. The server allows a maximum of 300 TagBindings to return. If unspecified, the server will use 100 as the default.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A pagination token returned from a previous call to `ListTagBindings` that indicates where this listing should continue from.
  parent: string, Required. The full resource name of a resource for which you want to list existing TagBindings. E.g. &quot;//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/123&quot;
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The ListTagBindings response.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Pagination token. If the result set is too large to fit in a single response, this token is returned. It encodes the position of the current result cursor. Feeding this value into a new list request with the `page_token` parameter gives the next page of the results. When `next_page_token` is not filled in, there is no next page and the list returned is the last page in the result set. Pagination tokens have a limited lifetime.
  &quot;tagBindings&quot;: [ # A possibly paginated list of TagBindings for the specified TagValue or resource.
    { # A TagBinding represents a connection between a TagValue and a cloud resource (currently project, folder, or organization). Once a TagBinding is created, the TagValue is applied to all the descendants of the cloud resource.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the TagBinding. This is a String of the form: `tagBindings/{full-resource-name}/{tag-value-name}` (e.g. `tagBindings/%2F%2Fcloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2F123/tagValues/456`).

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
