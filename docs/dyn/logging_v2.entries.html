  <pre>Lists log entries.  Use this method to retrieve log entries from Cloud
Logging.  For ways to export log entries, see
[Exporting Logs](/logging/docs/export).

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The parameters to `ListLogEntries`.
    "orderBy": "A String", # Optional. How the results should be sorted.  Presently, the only permitted
        # values are `"timestamp asc"` (default) and `"timestamp desc"`. The first
        # option returns entries in order of increasing values of
        # `LogEntry.timestamp` (oldest first), and the second option returns entries
        # in order of decreasing timestamps (newest first).  Entries with equal
        # timestamps are returned in order of `LogEntry.insertId`.
    "resourceNames": [ # Required. One or more cloud resources from which to retrieve log entries.
        # Example: `"projects/my-project-1A"`, `"projects/1234567890"`.  Projects
        # listed in `projectIds` are added to this list.
      "A String",
    ],
    "pageSize": 42, # Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request.
        # Non-positive values are ignored.  The presence of `nextPageToken` in the
        # response indicates that more results might be available.
    "filter": "A String", # Optional. A filter that chooses which log entries to return.  See [Advanced
        # Logs Filters](/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters).  Only log entries that
        # match the filter are returned.  An empty filter matches all log entries.
    "pageToken": "A String", # Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the
        # preceding call to this method.  `pageToken` must be the value of
        # `nextPageToken` from the previous response.  The values of other method
        # parameters should be identical to those in the previous call.
    "projectIds": [ # Deprecated. One or more project identifiers or project numbers from which
        # to retrieve log entries.  Examples: `"my-project-1A"`, `"1234567890"`. If
        # present, these project identifiers are converted to resource format and
        # added to the list of resources in `resourceNames`. Callers should use
        # `resourceNames` rather than this parameter.
