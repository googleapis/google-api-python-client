  <pre>Creates a new GrpcRoute in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the GrpcRoute. Must be in the format `projects/*/locations/global`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # GrpcRoute is the resource defining how gRPC traffic routed by a Mesh or Gateway resource is routed.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A free-text description of the resource. Max length 1024 characters.
  &quot;gateways&quot;: [ # Optional. Gateways defines a list of gateways this GrpcRoute is attached to, as one of the routing rules to route the requests served by the gateway. Each gateway reference should match the pattern: `projects/*/locations/global/gateways/`
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;hostnames&quot;: [ # Required. Service hostnames with an optional port for which this route describes traffic. Format: [:] Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions: - IPs are not allowed. - A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be &quot;precise&quot; which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. `foo.example.com`) or &quot;wildcard&quot;, which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`). Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or &#x27;-&#x27;, and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateway must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames `*.foo.bar.com` and `*.bar.com` to be associated with the same route, it is not possible to associate two routes both with `*.bar.com` or both with `bar.com`. If a port is specified, then gRPC clients must use the channel URI with the port to match this rule (i.e. &quot;xds:///service:123&quot;), otherwise they must supply the URI without a port (i.e. &quot;xds:///service&quot;).

            &quot;weight&quot;: 42, # Optional. Specifies the proportion of requests forwarded to the backend referenced by the serviceName field. This is computed as: - weight/Sum(weights in this destination list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an implementation supports. If only one serviceName is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100% of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weights are specified for any one service name, they need to be specified for all of them. If weights are unspecified for all services, then, traffic is distributed in equal proportions to all of them.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
