<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(filterSetName=None, 123, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all metrics that are measured in terms of number of bids.

Args:
  filterSetName: string, Name of the filter set that should be applied to the requested metrics.
For example:

- For a bidder-level filter set for bidder 123:
  `bidders/123/filterSets/abc`

- For an account-level filter set for the buyer account representing bidder
  123: `bidders/123/accounts/123/filterSets/abc`

- For an account-level filter set for the child seat buyer account 456
  whose bidder is 123: `bidders/123/accounts/456/filterSets/abc` (required)
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. The server may return fewer results than requested.
If unspecified, the server will pick an appropriate default.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying a page of results the server should return.
Typically, this is the value of
ListBidMetricsResponse.nextPageToken
returned from the previous call to the bidMetrics.list
method.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
