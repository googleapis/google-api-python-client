<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent=None, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a variable within the given configuration. You cannot create
a variable with a name that is a prefix of an existing variable name, or a
name that has an existing variable name as a prefix.

To learn more about creating a variable, read the
[Setting and Getting Data](/deployment-manager/runtime-configurator/set-and-get-variables)
documentation.

Args:
  parent: string, The path to the RutimeConfig resource that this variable should belong to.
The configuration must exist beforehand; the path must by in the format:

`projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME]` (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a single variable within a RuntimeConfig resource.
    # The name denotes the hierarchical variable name. For example,
    # `ports/serving_port` is a valid variable name. The variable value is an
    # opaque string and only leaf variables can have values (that is, variables
    # that do not have any child variables).
  "text": "A String", # The textual value of the variable. The length of the value must be less
      # than 4096 bytes. Empty values are also accepted.
      # NB: Only one of value and string_value can be set at the same time.
  "updateTime": "A String", # [Output Only] The time of the last variable update.

      # The `[VARIABLE_NAME]` can contain ASCII letters, numbers, slashes and
      # dashes. Slashes are used as path element separators and are not part of the
      # `[VARIABLE_NAME]` itself, so `[VARIABLE_NAME]` must contain at least one
      # non-slash character. Multiple slashes are coalesced into single slash
      # character. Each path segment should follow RFC 1035 segment specification.
      # The length of a `[VARIABLE_NAME]` must be less than 256 bytes.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="watch">watch(name=None, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Watches a specific variable and waits for a change in the variable's value.
When there is a change, this method returns the new value or times out.

If a variable is deleted while being watched, the `variableState` state is
set to `DELETED` and the method returns the last known variable `value`.

If you set the deadline for watching to a larger value than internal timeout
(60 seconds), the current variable value is returned and the `variableState`
will be `VARIABLE_STATE_UNSPECIFIED`.

documentation.

Args:

        # The `[PROJECT_ID]` must be a valid project ID, `[CONFIG_NAME]` must be a
        # valid RuntimeConfig reource and `[VARIABLE_NAME]` follows Unix file system
        # file path naming.
        #
        # The `[VARIABLE_NAME]` can contain ASCII letters, numbers, slashes and
        # dashes. Slashes are used as path element separators and are not part of the
        # `[VARIABLE_NAME]` itself, so `[VARIABLE_NAME]` must contain at least one
        # non-slash character. Multiple slashes are coalesced into single slash
        # character. Each path segment should follow RFC 1035 segment specification.
        # The length of a `[VARIABLE_NAME]` must be less than 256 bytes.
        #
        # Once you create a variable, you cannot change the variable name.
