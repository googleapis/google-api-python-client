<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, backupId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts creating a new Cloud Spanner Backup.
The returned backup long-running operation
will have a name of the format
`projects/&lt;project&gt;/instances/&lt;instance&gt;/backups/&lt;backup&gt;/operations/&lt;operation_id&gt;`
and can be used to track creation of the backup. The
metadata field type is
CreateBackupMetadata. The
response field type is
Backup, if successful. Cancelling the returned operation will stop the
creation and delete the backup.
There can be only one pending backup creation per database. Backup creation
of different databases can run concurrently.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the instance in which the backup will be
created. This must be the same instance that contains the database the
backup will be created from. The backup will be stored in the
location(s) specified in the instance configuration of this
instance. Values are of the form
`projects/&lt;project&gt;/instances/&lt;instance&gt;`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A backup of a Cloud Spanner database.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The backup will contain an externally consistent
        # copy of the database at the timestamp specified by
        # `create_time`. `create_time` is approximately the time the
        # CreateBackup request is received.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the backup.
    &quot;database&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required for the CreateBackup operation.
        # Name of the database from which this backup was
        # created. This needs to be in the same instance as the backup.
        # Values are of the form
        # `projects/&lt;project&gt;/instances/&lt;instance&gt;/databases/&lt;database&gt;`.
    &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required for the CreateBackup
        # operation. The expiration time of the backup, with microseconds
        # granularity that must be at least 6 hours and at most 366 days
        # from the time the CreateBackup request is processed. Once the `expire_time`
        # has passed, the backup is eligible to be automatically deleted by Cloud
        # Spanner to free the resources used by the backup.
    &quot;referencingDatabases&quot;: [ # Output only. The names of the restored databases that reference the backup.
        # The database names are of
        # the form `projects/&lt;project&gt;/instances/&lt;instance&gt;/databases/&lt;database&gt;`.
        # Referencing databases may exist in different instances. The existence of
        # any referencing database prevents the backup from being deleted. When a
        # restored database from the backup enters the `READY` state, the reference
        # to the backup is removed.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;sizeBytes&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Size of the backup in bytes.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only for the CreateBackup operation.
        # Required for the UpdateBackup operation.

        # The final segment of the name must be between 2 and 60 characters
        # in length.
        #

        # by the prefix of the backup name of the form
        # `projects/&lt;project&gt;/instances/&lt;instance&gt;`.
  }

  backupId: string, Required. The id of the backup to be created. The `backup_id` appended to

        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, filter=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists completed and pending backups.
Backups returned are ordered by `create_time` in descending order,
starting from the most recent `create_time`.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The instance to list backups from.  Values are of the
form `projects/&lt;project&gt;/instances/&lt;instance&gt;`. (required)
  pageSize: integer, Number of backups to be returned in the response. If 0 or
less, defaults to the server&#x27;s maximum allowed page size.
  pageToken: string, If non-empty, `page_token` should contain a
next_page_token from a
previous ListBackupsResponse to the same `parent` and with the same
`filter`.
  filter: string, An expression that filters the list of returned backups.

A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison operator, and a
value for filtering.
The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator
must be one of: `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=`, `!=`, `=`, or `:`.
Colon `:` is the contains operator. Filter rules are not case sensitive.

The following fields in the Backup are eligible for filtering:

  * `name`
  * `database`
  * `state`
  * `create_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
  * `expire_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
  * `size_bytes`

You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each expression in
parentheses. By default, expressions are combined with AND logic, but
you can specify AND, OR, and NOT logic explicitly.

Here are a few examples:

  * `name:Howl` - The backup&#x27;s name contains the string &quot;howl&quot;.
  * `database:prod`
         - The database&#x27;s name contains the string &quot;prod&quot;.
  * `state:CREATING` - The backup is pending creation.
  * `state:READY` - The backup is fully created and ready for use.
  * `(name:howl) AND (create_time &lt; \&quot;2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\&quot;)`
         - The backup name contains the string &quot;howl&quot; and `create_time`
             of the backup is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z.
  * `expire_time &lt; \&quot;2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\&quot;`
         - The backup `expire_time` is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z.
  * `size_bytes &gt; 10000000000` - The backup&#x27;s size is greater than 10GB

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help

        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

        #
        # Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value
        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that the caller has on the specified database or backup
resource.

Attempting this RPC on a non-existent Cloud Spanner database will
result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has
`spanner.databases.list` permission on the containing Cloud
Spanner instance. Otherwise returns an empty set of permissions.
Calling this method on a backup that does not exist will
result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has
`spanner.backups.list` permission on the containing instance.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The Cloud Spanner resource for which permissions are being tested. The format is `projects/&lt;project ID&gt;/instances/&lt;instance ID&gt;` for instance resources and `projects/&lt;project ID&gt;/instances/&lt;instance ID&gt;/databases/&lt;database ID&gt;` for database resources. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # REQUIRED: The set of permissions to check for &#x27;resource&#x27;.
        # Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.instances.*&#x27;) are not allowed.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
