There can be only one pending backup creation per database. Backup creation of different databases can run concurrently.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the instance in which the backup will be created. This must be the same instance that contains the database the backup will be created from. The backup will be stored in the location(s) specified in the instance configuration of this instance. Values are of the form `projects//instances/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A backup of a Cloud Spanner database.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the CreateBackup request is received. If the request does not specify `version_time`, the `version_time` of the backup will be equivalent to the `create_time`.
  &quot;database&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required for the CreateBackup operation. Name of the database from which this backup was created. This needs to be in the same instance as the backup. Values are of the form `projects//instances//databases/`.
  &quot;encryptionInfo&quot;: { # Encryption information for a Cloud Spanner database or backup. # Output only. The encryption information for the backup.
    &quot;encryptionStatus&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Output only. If present, the status of a recent encrypt/decrypt call on underlying data for this database or backup. Regardless of status, data is always encrypted at rest.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only for the CreateBackup operation. Required for the UpdateBackup operation. A globally unique identifier for the backup which cannot be changed. Values are of the form `projects//instances//backups/a-z*[a-z0-9]` The final segment of the name must be between 2 and 60 characters in length. The backup is stored in the location(s) specified in the instance configuration of the instance containing the backup, identified by the prefix of the backup name of the form `projects//instances/`.
  &quot;referencingDatabases&quot;: [ # Output only. The names of the restored databases that reference the backup. The database names are of the form `projects//instances//databases/`.

    Allowed values
      ENCRYPTION_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED - Unspecified. Do not use.
      USE_DATABASE_ENCRYPTION - Use the same encryption configuration as the database. This is the default option when encryption_config is empty. For example, if the database is using `Customer_Managed_Encryption`, the backup will be using the same Cloud KMS key as the database.
      GOOGLE_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION - Use Google default encryption.
      CUSTOMER_MANAGED_ENCRYPTION - Use customer managed encryption. If specified, `kms_key_name` must contain a valid Cloud KMS key.
  encryptionConfig_kmsKeyName: string, Optional. The Cloud KMS key that will be used to protect the backup. This field should be set only when encryption_type is `CUSTOMER_MANAGED_ENCRYPTION`. Values are of the form `projects//locations//keyRings//cryptoKeys/`.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists completed and pending backups. Backups returned are ordered by `create_time` in descending order, starting from the most recent `create_time`.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The instance to list backups from. Values are of the form `projects//instances/`. (required)
  filter: string, An expression that filters the list of returned backups. A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=`, `!=`, `=`, or `:`. Colon `:` is the contains operator. Filter rules are not case sensitive. The following fields in the Backup are eligible for filtering: * `name` * `database` * `state` * `create_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `expire_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `version_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `size_bytes` You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each expression in parentheses. By default, expressions are combined with AND logic, but you can specify AND, OR, and NOT logic explicitly. Here are a few examples: * `name:Howl` - The backup&#x27;s name contains the string &quot;howl&quot;. * `database:prod` - The database&#x27;s name contains the string &quot;prod&quot;. * `state:CREATING` - The backup is pending creation. * `state:READY` - The backup is fully created and ready for use. * `(name:howl) AND (create_time &lt; \&quot;2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\&quot;)` - The backup name contains the string &quot;howl&quot; and `create_time` of the backup is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z. * `expire_time &lt; \&quot;2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\&quot;` - The backup `expire_time` is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z. * `size_bytes &gt; 10000000000` - The backup&#x27;s size is greater than 10GB
  pageSize: integer, Number of backups to be returned in the response. If 0 or less, defaults to the server&#x27;s maximum allowed page size.
  pageToken: string, If non-empty, `page_token` should contain a next_page_token from a previous ListBackupsResponse to the same `parent` and with the same `filter`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.

See the service documentation for additional information. # The condition that is associated with this binding. If the condition evaluates to `true`, then this binding applies to the current request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding might grant the same role to one or more of the members in this binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

      &quot;members&quot;: [ # Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that the caller has on the specified database or backup resource. Attempting this RPC on a non-existent Cloud Spanner database will result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has `spanner.databases.list` permission on the containing Cloud Spanner instance. Otherwise returns an empty set of permissions. Calling this method on a backup that does not exist will result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has `spanner.backups.list` permission on the containing instance.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The Cloud Spanner resource for which permissions are being tested. The format is `projects//instances/` for instance resources and `projects//instances//databases/` for database resources. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # REQUIRED: The set of permissions to check for &#x27;resource&#x27;. Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.instances.*&#x27;) are not allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
