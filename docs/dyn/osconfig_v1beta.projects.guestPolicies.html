Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the parent using one of the following forms: `projects/{project_number}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

Otherwise, the targeted VM instances must meet all the criteria specified. So if both labels and zones are specified, the policy applies to VM instances with those labels and in those zones. # Required. Specifies the VM instances that are assigned to this policy. This allows you to target sets or groups of VM instances by different parameters such as labels, names, OS, or zones. If left empty, all VM instances underneath this policy are targeted. At the same level in the resource hierarchy (that is within a project), the service prevents the creation of multiple policies that conflict with each other. For more information, see how the service [handles assignment conflicts](/compute/docs/os-config-management/create-guest-policy#handle-conflicts).

Additionally, recipes support executing a script (either defined in a file or directly in this api) in bash, sh, cmd, and powershell. Updating a software recipe If a recipe is assigned to an instance and there is a recipe with the same name but a lower version already installed and the assigned state of the recipe is `UPDATED`, then the recipe is updated to the new version.

Additionally, recipes support executing a script (either defined in a file or directly in this api) in bash, sh, cmd, and powershell. Updating a software recipe If a recipe is assigned to an instance and there is a recipe with the same name but a lower version already installed and the assigned state of the recipe is `UPDATED`, then the recipe is updated to the new version.

Additionally, recipes support executing a script (either defined in a file or directly in this api) in bash, sh, cmd, and powershell. Updating a software recipe If a recipe is assigned to an instance and there is a recipe with the same name but a lower version already installed and the assigned state of the recipe is `UPDATED`, then the recipe is updated to the new version.

Additionally, recipes support executing a script (either defined in a file or directly in this api) in bash, sh, cmd, and powershell. Updating a software recipe If a recipe is assigned to an instance and there is a recipe with the same name but a lower version already installed and the assigned state of the recipe is `UPDATED`, then the recipe is updated to the new version.

    { # A software recipe is a set of instructions for installing and configuring a piece of software. It consists of a set of artifacts that are downloaded, and a set of steps that install, configure, and/or update the software. Recipes support installing and updating software from artifacts in the following formats: Zip archive, Tar archive, Windows MSI, Debian package, and RPM package. Additionally, recipes support executing a script (either defined in a file or directly in this api) in bash, sh, cmd, and powershell. Updating a software recipe If a recipe is assigned to an instance and there is a recipe with the same name but a lower version already installed and the assigned state of the recipe is `UPDATED`, then the recipe is updated to the new version. Script Working Directories Each script or execution step is run in its own temporary directory which is deleted after completing the step.
      &quot;artifacts&quot;: [ # Resources available to be used in the steps in the recipe.
        { # Specifies a resource to be used in the recipe.
          &quot;allowInsecure&quot;: True or False, # Defaults to false. When false, recipes are subject to validations based on the artifact type: Remote: A checksum must be specified, and only protocols with transport-layer security are permitted. GCS: An object generation number must be specified.
          &quot;gcs&quot;: { # Specifies an artifact available as a Google Cloud Storage object. # A Google Cloud Storage artifact.
            &quot;bucket&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Bucket of the Google Cloud Storage object. Given an example URL: `https://storage.googleapis.com/my-bucket/foo/bar#1234567` this value would be `my-bucket`.

If the checksum is not empty and it doesn&#x27;t match the artifact then the recipe installation fails before running any of the steps.
