  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Immutable. The creation time of the membership, such as when a member joined or was invited to join a space. This field is output only, except when used to import historical memberships in import mode spaces.
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Immutable. The deletion time of the membership, such as when a member left or was removed from a space. This field is output only, except when used to import historical memberships in import mode spaces.
  &quot;groupMember&quot;: { # A Google Group in Google Chat. # Optional. The Google Group the membership corresponds to. Reading or mutating memberships for Google Groups requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user).

The Google Chat user or app the membership corresponds to. If your Chat app [authenticates as a user](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user), the output populates the [user](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/User) `name` and `type`.
    &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The user&#x27;s display name.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, showGroups=None, showInvited=None, useAdminAccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists memberships in a space. For an example, see [List users and Google Chat apps in a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/list-members). Listing memberships with [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) lists memberships in spaces that the Chat app has access to, but excludes Chat app memberships, including its own. Listing memberships with [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) lists memberships in spaces that the authenticated user has access to. Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) You can authenticate and authorize this method with administrator privileges by setting the `use_admin_access` field in the request.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the space for which to fetch a membership list. Format: spaces/{space} (required)
  filter: string, Optional. A query filter. You can filter memberships by a member&#x27;s role ([`role`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.members#membershiprole)) and type ([`member.type`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/User#type)). To filter by role, set `role` to `ROLE_MEMBER` or `ROLE_MANAGER`. To filter by type, set `member.type` to `HUMAN` or `BOT`. You can also filter for `member.type` using the `!=` operator. To filter by both role and type, use the `AND` operator. To filter by either role or type, use the `OR` operator. Either `member.type = &quot;HUMAN&quot;` or `member.type != &quot;BOT&quot;` is required when `use_admin_access` is set to true. Other member type filters will be rejected. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` role = &quot;ROLE_MANAGER&quot; OR role = &quot;ROLE_MEMBER&quot; member.type = &quot;HUMAN&quot; AND role = &quot;ROLE_MANAGER&quot; member.type != &quot;BOT&quot; ``` The following queries are invalid: ``` member.type = &quot;HUMAN&quot; AND member.type = &quot;BOT&quot; role = &quot;ROLE_MANAGER&quot; AND role = &quot;ROLE_MEMBER&quot; ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of memberships to return. The service might return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 memberships are returned. The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value more than 1000, it&#x27;s automatically changed to 1000. Negative values return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous call to list memberships. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other parameters might lead to unexpected results.
  showGroups: boolean, Optional. When `true`, also returns memberships associated with a Google Group, in addition to other types of memberships. If a filter is set, Google Group memberships that don&#x27;t match the filter criteria aren&#x27;t returned.
  showInvited: boolean, Optional. When `true`, also returns memberships associated with invited members, in addition to other types of memberships. If a filter is set, invited memberships that don&#x27;t match the filter criteria aren&#x27;t returned. Currently requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user).
  useAdminAccess: boolean, Optional. When `true`, the method runs using the user&#x27;s Google Workspace administrator privileges. The calling user must be a Google Workspace administrator with the [manage chat and spaces conversations privilege](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13369245). Requires either the `chat.admin.memberships.readonly` or `chat.admin.memberships` [OAuth 2.0 scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes). Listing app memberships in a space isn&#x27;t supported when using admin access.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
