<p class="firstline">Creates a human membership or app membership for the calling app. Creating memberships for other apps isn't supported. For an example, see [Invite or add a user or a Google Chat app to a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-members). When creating a membership, if the specified member has their auto-accept policy turned off, then they're invited, and must accept the space invitation before joining. Otherwise, creating a membership adds the member directly to the specified space. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user). To specify the member to add, set the `membership.member.name` for the human or app member, or set the `membership.group_member.name` for the group member. - To add the calling app to a space or a direct message between two human users, use `users/app`. Unable to add other apps to the space. - To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `id` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person profile ID for `user@example.com` is `123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. - To add or invite a Google group in a named space, use `groups/{group}`, where `{group}` is the `id` for the group from the Cloud Identity Groups API. For example, you can use [Cloud Identity Groups lookup API](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups/lookup) to retrieve the ID `123456789` for group email `group@example.com`, then you can add or invite the group to a named space by setting the `membership.group_member.name` to `groups/123456789`.

  <pre>Lists memberships in a space. For an example, see [List users and Google Chat apps in a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/list-members). Listing memberships with [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) lists memberships in spaces that the Chat app has access to, but excludes Chat app memberships, including its own. Listing memberships with [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) lists memberships in spaces that the authenticated user has access to. Requires [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize). Supports [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) and [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user).

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the space for which to fetch a membership list. Format: spaces/{space} (required)
  filter: string, Optional. A query filter. You can filter memberships by a member&#x27;s role ([`role`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.members#membershiprole)) and type ([`member.type`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/User#type)). To filter by role, set `role` to `ROLE_MEMBER` or `ROLE_MANAGER`. To filter by type, set `member.type` to `HUMAN` or `BOT`. Developer Preview: You can also filter for `member.type` using the `!=` operator. To filter by both role and type, use the `AND` operator. To filter by either role or type, use the `OR` operator. Either `member.type = &quot;HUMAN&quot;` or `member.type != &quot;BOT&quot;` is required when `use_admin_access` is set to true. Other member type filters will be rejected. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` role = &quot;ROLE_MANAGER&quot; OR role = &quot;ROLE_MEMBER&quot; member.type = &quot;HUMAN&quot; AND role = &quot;ROLE_MANAGER&quot; member.type != &quot;BOT&quot; ``` The following queries are invalid: ``` member.type = &quot;HUMAN&quot; AND member.type = &quot;BOT&quot; role = &quot;ROLE_MANAGER&quot; AND role = &quot;ROLE_MEMBER&quot; ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of memberships to return. The service might return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 memberships are returned. The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value more than 1000, it&#x27;s automatically changed to 1000. Negative values return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous call to list memberships. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other parameters might lead to unexpected results.
  showGroups: boolean, Optional. When `true`, also returns memberships associated with a Google Group, in addition to other types of memberships. If a filter is set, Google Group memberships that don&#x27;t match the filter criteria aren&#x27;t returned.
  showInvited: boolean, Optional. When `true`, also returns memberships associated with invited members, in addition to other types of memberships. If a filter is set, invited memberships that don&#x27;t match the filter criteria aren&#x27;t returned. Currently requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user).
