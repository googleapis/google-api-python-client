For an example, see [ Create a membership](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/create). When creating a membership, if the specified member has their auto-accept policy turned off, then they're invited, and must accept the space invitation before joining. Otherwise, creating a membership adds the member directly to the specified space. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users) and the `chat.memberships` (for human membership) or `chat.memberships.app` (for app membership) scope. To specify the member to add, set the `membership.member.name` in the `CreateMembershipRequest`: - To add the calling app to a space or a direct message between two human users, use `users/app`. Unable to add other apps to the space. - To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` is either the `{person_id}` for the [person](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people) from the People API, or the `id` for the [user](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users) in the Directory API. For example, if the People API `Person` `resourceName` is `people/123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/123456789`.</p>

  <pre>Lists memberships in a space. For an example, see [List memberships](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/list). Listing memberships with [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/service-accounts) lists memberships in spaces that the Chat app has access to, but excludes Chat app memberships, including its own. Listing memberships with [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users) lists memberships in spaces that the authenticated user has access to. Requires [authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth). Fully supports [service account authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/service-accounts) and [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users). [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users) requires the `chat.memberships` or `chat.memberships.readonly` authorization scope.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the space for which to fetch a membership list. Format: spaces/{space} (required)
  filter: string, Optional. A query filter. You can filter memberships by a member&#x27;s role ([`role`](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.members#membershiprole)) and type ([`member.type`](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/User#type)). To filter by role, set `role` to `ROLE_MEMBER` or `ROLE_MANAGER`. To filter by type, set `member.type` to `HUMAN` or `BOT`. To filter by both role and type, use the `AND` operator. To filter by either role or type, use the `OR` operator. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` role = &quot;ROLE_MANAGER&quot; OR role = &quot;ROLE_MEMBER&quot; member.type = &quot;HUMAN&quot; AND role = &quot;ROLE_MANAGER&quot; ``` The following queries are invalid: ``` member.type = &quot;HUMAN&quot; AND member.type = &quot;BOT&quot; role = &quot;ROLE_MANAGER&quot; AND role = &quot;ROLE_MEMBER&quot; ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of memberships to return. The service might return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 memberships are returned. The maximum value is 1,000. If you use a value more than 1,000, it&#x27;s automatically changed to 1,000. Negative values return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous call to list memberships. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other parameters might lead to unexpected results.
  showInvited: boolean, Optional. When `true`, also returns memberships associated with invited members, in addition to other types of memberships. If a filter is set, invited memberships that don&#x27;t match the filter criteria aren&#x27;t returned. Currently requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
