<div class="method">

  <pre>Creates an Environment in the specified Agent.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The Agent to create an Environment for. Format: `projects//locations//agents/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents an environment for an agent. You can create multiple versions of your agent and publish them to separate environments. When you edit an agent, you are editing the draft agent. At any point, you can save the draft agent as an agent version, which is an immutable snapshot of your agent. When you save the draft agent, it is published to the default environment. When you create agent versions, you can publish them to custom environments. You can create a variety of custom environments for testing, development, production, etc.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The human-readable description of the environment. The maximum length is 500 characters. If exceeded, the request is rejected.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human-readable name of the environment (unique in an agent). Limit of 64 characters.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the environment. Format: `projects//locations//agents//environments/`.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Update time of this environment.
  &quot;versionConfigs&quot;: [ # Required. A list of configurations for flow versions. You should include version configs for all flows that are reachable from `Start Flow` in the agent. Otherwise, an error will be returned.
    { # Configuration for the version.
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Format: projects//locations//agents//flows//versions/.
    },
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
