  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="runContinuousTest">runContinuousTest(environment, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Kicks off a continuous test under the specified Environment. This method is a [long-running operation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/how/long-running-operation). The returned `Operation` type has the following method-specific fields: - `metadata`: RunContinuousTestMetadata - `response`: RunContinuousTestResponse

Args:
  environment: string, Required. Format: `projects//locations//agents//environments/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for Environments.RunContinuousTest.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
