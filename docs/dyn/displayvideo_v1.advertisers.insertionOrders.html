<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(advertiserId, filter=None, pageToken=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists insertion orders in an advertiser.

The order is defined by the order_by
parameter.
If a filter by
entity_status is not specified, insertion
orders with `ENTITY_STATUS_ARCHIVED` will not be included in the results.

Args:
  advertiserId: string, Required. The ID of the advertiser to list insertion orders for. (required)
  filter: string, Allows filtering by insertion order properties.

Supported syntax:

* Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions.
* Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A
sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`.
* A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`.
* The operator must be `EQUALS (=)`.
* Supported fields:
    - `campaignId`
    - `entityStatus`

Examples:

* All insertion orders under a campaign: `campaignId=&quot;1234&quot;`
* All `ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE` or `ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED` insertion orders
under an advertiser:
`(entityStatus=&quot;ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE&quot; OR
entityStatus=&quot;ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED&quot;)`

The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying a page of results the server should return.
Typically, this is the value of
next_page_token returned
from the previous call to `ListInsertionOrders` method. If not specified,
the first page of results will be returned.
  orderBy: string, Field by which to sort the list.
Acceptable values are:

* &quot;displayName&quot; (default)
* &quot;entityStatus&quot;

The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for
a field, a suffix &quot;desc&quot; should be added to the field name. Example:
`displayName desc`.
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. Must be between `1` and `100`. If unspecified will
default to `100`. Returns error code `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if an invalid value
is specified.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
