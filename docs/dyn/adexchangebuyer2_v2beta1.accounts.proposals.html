Args:
  accountId: string, Account ID of the buyer. (required)
  proposalId: string, The ID of the proposal to accept. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to accept a proposal.
    &quot;proposalRevision&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The last known client revision number of the proposal.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="completeSetup">completeSetup(accountId, proposalId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Update the given proposal to indicate that setup has been completed.
This method is called by the buyer when the line items have been created
on their end for a finalized proposal and all the required creatives
have been uploaded using the creatives API. This call updates the
`is_setup_completed` bit on the proposal and also notifies the seller.
The server will advance the revision number of the most recent proposal.

Args:
  accountId: string, Account ID of the buyer. (required)
  proposalId: string, The ID of the proposal to mark as setup completed. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for indicating that the proposal&#x27;s setup step is complete.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(accountId, pageToken=None, filterSyntax=None, filter=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>List proposals. A filter expression (PQL query) may be specified to
filter the results. To retrieve all finalized proposals, regardless if a
proposal is being renegotiated, see the FinalizedProposals resource.
Note that Bidder/ChildSeat relationships differ from the usual behavior.
A Bidder account can only see its child seats&#x27; proposals by specifying
the ChildSeat&#x27;s accountId in the request path.

Args:
  accountId: string, Account ID of the buyer. (required)
  pageToken: string, The page token as returned from ListProposalsResponse.
  filterSyntax: string, Syntax the filter is written in. Current implementation defaults to PQL
but in the future it will be LIST_FILTER.
  filter: string, An optional PQL filter query used to query for proposals.

Nested repeated fields, such as proposal.deals.targetingCriterion,
cannot be filtered.
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. The server may return fewer results than requested.
If unspecified, the server will pick an appropriate default.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  <pre>Update the given proposal at the client known revision number. If the
server revision has advanced since the passed-in
`proposal.proposal_revision`, an `ABORTED` error message will be returned.
Only the buyer-modifiable fields of the proposal will be updated.

Note that the deals in the proposal will be updated to match the passed-in
copy.
If a passed-in deal does not have a `deal_id`, the server will assign a new
unique ID and create the deal.
If passed-in deal has a `deal_id`, it will be updated to match the
passed-in copy.
Any existing deals not present in the passed-in proposal will be deleted.
It is an error to pass in a deal with a `deal_id` not present at head.

Args:
  accountId: string, Account ID of the buyer. (required)
  proposalId: string, The unique ID of the proposal. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
