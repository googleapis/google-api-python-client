<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#accept">accept(accountId, proposalId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Mark the proposal as accepted at the given revision number. If the number does not match the server's revision number an `ABORTED` error message will be returned. This call updates the proposal_state from `PROPOSED` to `BUYER_ACCEPTED`, or from `SELLER_ACCEPTED` to `FINALIZED`. Upon calling this endpoint, the buyer implicitly agrees to the terms and conditions optionally set within the proposal by the publisher.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#addNote">addNote(accountId, proposalId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Create a new note and attach it to the proposal. The note is assigned a unique ID by the server. The proposal revision number will not increase when associated with a new note.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#cancelNegotiation">cancelNegotiation(accountId, proposalId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Cancel an ongoing negotiation on a proposal. This does not cancel or end serving for the deals if the proposal has been finalized, but only cancels a negotiation unilaterally.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#close">close()</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Close httplib2 connections.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#completeSetup">completeSetup(accountId, proposalId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Update the given proposal to indicate that setup has been completed. This method is called by the buyer when the line items have been created on their end for a finalized proposal and all the required creatives have been uploaded using the creatives API. This call updates the `is_setup_completed` bit on the proposal and also notifies the seller. The server will advance the revision number of the most recent proposal.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#create">create(accountId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Create the given proposal. Each created proposal and any deals it contains are assigned a unique ID by the server.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#get">get(accountId, proposalId, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets a proposal given its ID. The proposal is returned at its head revision.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#list">list(accountId, filter=None, filterSyntax=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">List proposals. A filter expression (PQL query) may be specified to filter the results. To retrieve all finalized proposals, regardless if a proposal is being renegotiated, see the FinalizedProposals resource. Note that Bidder/ChildSeat relationships differ from the usual behavior. A Bidder account can only see its child seats' proposals by specifying the ChildSeat's accountId in the request path.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Retrieves the next page of results.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#pause">pause(accountId, proposalId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Update the given proposal to pause serving. This method will set the `DealServingMetadata.DealPauseStatus.has_buyer_paused` bit to true for all deals in the proposal. It is a no-op to pause an already-paused proposal. It is an error to call PauseProposal for a proposal that is not finalized or renegotiating.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#resume">resume(accountId, proposalId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Update the given proposal to resume serving. This method will set the `DealServingMetadata.DealPauseStatus.has_buyer_paused` bit to false for all deals in the proposal. Note that if the `has_seller_paused` bit is also set, serving will not resume until the seller also resumes. It is a no-op to resume an already-running proposal. It is an error to call ResumeProposal for a proposal that is not finalized or renegotiating.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#update">update(accountId, proposalId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Update the given proposal at the client known revision number. If the server revision has advanced since the passed-in `proposal.proposal_revision`, an `ABORTED` error message will be returned. Only the buyer-modifiable fields of the proposal will be updated. Note that the deals in the proposal will be updated to match the passed-in copy. If a passed-in deal does not have a `deal_id`, the server will assign a new unique ID and create the deal. If passed-in deal has a `deal_id`, it will be updated to match the passed-in copy. Any existing deals not present in the passed-in proposal will be deleted. It is an error to pass in a deal with a `deal_id` not present at head.</p>
<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">

  <pre>List proposals. A filter expression (PQL query) may be specified to filter the results. To retrieve all finalized proposals, regardless if a proposal is being renegotiated, see the FinalizedProposals resource. Note that Bidder/ChildSeat relationships differ from the usual behavior. A Bidder account can only see its child seats&#x27; proposals by specifying the ChildSeat&#x27;s accountId in the request path.

Args:
  accountId: string, Account ID of the buyer. (required)
  filter: string, An optional PQL filter query used to query for proposals. Nested repeated fields, such as proposal.deals.targetingCriterion, cannot be filtered.
  filterSyntax: string, Syntax the filter is written in. Current implementation defaults to PQL but in the future it will be LIST_FILTER.
    Allowed values
      FILTER_SYNTAX_UNSPECIFIED - A placeholder for an undefined filter syntax.
      PQL - PQL query syntax. Visit https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/pqlreference for PQL documentation and examples.
      LIST_FILTER - API list filtering syntax. Read about syntax and usage at https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/apis/guides/v2/list-filters.
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. The server may return fewer results than requested. If unspecified, the server will pick an appropriate default.
  pageToken: string, The page token as returned from ListProposalsResponse.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="resume">resume(accountId, proposalId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Update the given proposal to resume serving. This method will set the `DealServingMetadata.DealPauseStatus.has_buyer_paused` bit to false for all deals in the proposal. Note that if the `has_seller_paused` bit is also set, serving will not resume until the seller also resumes. It is a no-op to resume an already-running proposal. It is an error to call ResumeProposal for a proposal that is not finalized or renegotiating.

Args:
  accountId: string, Account ID of the buyer. (required)
  proposalId: string, The ID of the proposal to resume. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

  <pre>Update the given proposal at the client known revision number. If the server revision has advanced since the passed-in `proposal.proposal_revision`, an `ABORTED` error message will be returned. Only the buyer-modifiable fields of the proposal will be updated. Note that the deals in the proposal will be updated to match the passed-in copy. If a passed-in deal does not have a `deal_id`, the server will assign a new unique ID and create the deal. If passed-in deal has a `deal_id`, it will be updated to match the passed-in copy. Any existing deals not present in the passed-in proposal will be deleted. It is an error to pass in a deal with a `deal_id` not present at head.
