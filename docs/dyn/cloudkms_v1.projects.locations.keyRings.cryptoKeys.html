    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.

        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

        #
        # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
        # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
        # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
        # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
        # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

      &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
          # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
          # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
          # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
          # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
          # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
          # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
          #
          # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
          # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
          # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

          # are rejected.
          #
          # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
          # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
          #
          # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
          # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
          # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
          # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
          #   that includes conditions

          # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
          # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows

      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.
        #
        # Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value
        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
