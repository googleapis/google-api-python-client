<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of operation resources contained within the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, Maximum count of results to be returned.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Use this parameter if you want to list the next page of results. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: FIELD_NAME COMPARISON_STRING LITERAL_STRING.

The FIELD_NAME is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The COMPARISON_STRING must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The LITERAL_STRING is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, filter=name ne example-instance.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Contains a list of Operation resources.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] A token used to continue a truncate.
    "items": [ # [Output Only] The Operation resources.
