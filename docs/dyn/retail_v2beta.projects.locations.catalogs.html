<p class="firstline">Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using "default_branch" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.</p>

  <pre>Completes the specified prefix with keyword suggestions. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Enable Retail Search on Cloud Console before using this feature.

Args:
  catalog: string, Required. Catalog for which the completion is performed. Full resource name of catalog, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`. (required)
  dataset: string, Determines which dataset to use for fetching completion. &quot;user-data&quot; will use the imported dataset through CompletionService.ImportCompletionData. &quot;cloud-retail&quot; will use the dataset generated by cloud retail based on user events. If leave empty, it will use the &quot;user-data&quot;. Current supported values: * user-data * cloud-retail: This option requires enabling auto-learning function first. See [guidelines](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/completion-overview#generated-completion-dataset).
  deviceType: string, The device type context for completion suggestions. We recommend that you leave this field empty. It can apply different suggestions on different device types, e.g. `DESKTOP`, `MOBILE`. If it is empty, the suggestions are across all device types. Supported formats: * `UNKNOWN_DEVICE_TYPE` * `DESKTOP` * `MOBILE` * A customized string starts with `OTHER_`, e.g. `OTHER_IPHONE`.
  languageCodes: string, Note that this field applies for `user-data` dataset only. For requests with `cloud-retail` dataset, setting this field has no effect. The language filters applied to the output suggestions. If set, it should contain the language of the query. If not set, suggestions are returned without considering language restrictions. This is the BCP-47 language code, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47). The maximum number of language codes is 3. (repeated)
  maxSuggestions: integer, Completion max suggestions. If left unset or set to 0, then will fallback to the configured value CompletionConfig.max_suggestions. The maximum allowed max suggestions is 20. If it is set higher, it will be capped by 20.
  query: string, Required. The query used to generate suggestions. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
  visitorId: string, Required field. A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if the visitor logs in or out of the website. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Otherwise, a INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
          &quot;text&quot;: [ # The textual values of this custom attribute. For example, `[&quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;]` when the key is &quot;color&quot;. Empty string is not allowed.

  ],
  &quot;recentSearchResults&quot;: [ # Matched recent searches of this user. The maximum number of recent searches is 10. This field is a restricted feature. Contact Retail Search support team if you are interested in enabling it. This feature is only available when CompleteQueryRequest.visitor_id field is set and UserEvent is imported. The recent searches satisfy the follow rules: * They are ordered from latest to oldest. * They are matched with CompleteQueryRequest.query case insensitively. * They are transformed to lower case. * They are UTF-8 safe. Recent searches are deduplicated. More recent searches will be reserved when duplication happens.

This field is `False` for pre-loaded CatalogAttributes. Only pre-loaded catalog attributes that are neither in use by products nor predefined can be deleted. Catalog attributes that are either in use by products or are predefined attributes cannot be deleted; however, their configuration properties will reset to default values upon removal request. After catalog changes, it takes about 10 minutes for this field to update.

To be indexable, the attribute name can contain only alpha-numeric characters and underscores. For example, an attribute named `attributes.abc_xyz` can be indexed, but an attribute named `attributes.abc-xyz` cannot be indexed. If the attribute key starts with `attributes.`, then the attribute is a custom attribute. Attributes such as `brands`, `patterns`, and `title` are built-in and called system attributes.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setDefaultBranch">setDefaultBranch(catalog, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using &quot;default_branch&quot; to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.

Args:
  catalog: string, Full resource name of the catalog, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`. (required)

  &quot;branchId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The final component of the resource name of a branch. This field must be one of &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot;. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. If there are no sufficient active products in the targeted branch and force is not set, a FAILED_PRECONDITION error is returned.
  &quot;force&quot;: True or False, # If set to true, it permits switching to a branch with branch_id even if it has no sufficient active products.
  &quot;note&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Some note on this request, this can be retrieved by CatalogService.GetDefaultBranch before next valid default branch set occurs. This field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

Catalog attributes that are either in use by products or are predefined attributes cannot be deleted; however, their configuration properties will reset to default values upon removal request. After catalog changes, it takes about 10 minutes for this field to update.

If the attribute key starts with `attributes.`, then the attribute is a custom attribute. Attributes such as `brands`, `patterns`, and `title` are built-in and called system attributes.
