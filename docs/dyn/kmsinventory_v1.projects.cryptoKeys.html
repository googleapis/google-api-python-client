  <pre>Returns cryptographic keys managed by Cloud KMS in a given Cloud project. Note that this data is sourced from snapshots, meaning it may not completely reflect the actual state of key metadata at call time.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The Google Cloud project for which to retrieve key metadata, in the format `projects/*` (required)
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of keys to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 1000 keys will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.
  pageToken: string, Optional. Pass this into a subsequent request in order to receive the next page of results.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
