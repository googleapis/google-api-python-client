<div class="method">

  <pre>Creates course work.

The resulting course work (and corresponding student submissions) are
associated with the Developer Console project of the
[OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to
make the request. Classroom API requests to modify course work and student
submissions must be made with an OAuth client ID from the associated
Developer Console project.

This method returns the following error codes:

* `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the
requested course, create course work in the requested course, share a
Drive attachment, or for access errors.
* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed.
* `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course does not exist.
* `FAILED_PRECONDITION` for the following request error:
    * AttachmentNotVisible
