  <pre>Returns a list of course work that the requester is permitted to view. Course students may only view `PUBLISHED` course work. Course teachers and domain administrators may view all course work. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the requested course or for access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed. * `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course does not exist.

Args:
  courseId: string, Identifier of the course. This identifier can be either the Classroom-assigned identifier or an alias. (required)
  orderBy: string, Optional sort ordering for results. A comma-separated list of fields with an optional sort direction keyword. Supported fields are `updateTime` and `dueDate`. Supported direction keywords are `asc` and `desc`. If not specified, `updateTime desc` is the default behavior. Examples: `dueDate asc,updateTime desc`, `updateTime,dueDate desc`
  courseWorkStates: string, Restriction on the work status to return. Only courseWork that matches is returned. If unspecified, items with a work status of `PUBLISHED` is returned. (repeated)
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of items to return. Zero or unspecified indicates that the server may assign a maximum. The server may return fewer than the specified number of results.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
  pageToken: string, nextPageToken value returned from a previous list call, indicating that the subsequent page of results should be returned. The list request must be otherwise identical to the one that resulted in this token.
