  <pre>Creates course work.

The resulting course work (and corresponding student submissions) are
associated with the Developer Console project of the
[OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to
make the request. Classroom API requests to modify course work and student
submissions must be made with an OAuth client ID from the associated
Developer Console project.

This method returns the following error codes:

* `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the
requested course, create course work in the requested course, share a
Drive attachment, or for access errors.
* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed.
* `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course does not exist.
* `FAILED_PRECONDITION` for the following request error:
    * AttachmentNotVisible

This method returns the following error codes:

* `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting developer project did not create
the corresponding course work, if the requesting user is not permitted
to delete the requested course or for access errors.
* `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the requested course work has already been
deleted.
* `NOT_FOUND` if no course exists with the requested ID.

Args:
  courseId: string, Identifier of the course.
This identifier can be either the Classroom-assigned identifier or an
alias. (required)
  id: string, Identifier of the course work to delete.
This identifier is a Classroom-assigned identifier. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
