Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for EstimateCostScenarioWithListPrice.
  &quot;costScenario&quot;: { # Encapsulates all the information needed to perform a cost estimate. It includes a specification of the Google Cloud usage whose costs are estimated, and configuration options. # The scenario to estimate costs for.
    &quot;commitments&quot;: [ # New commitments to estimate the costs for. The cost of the commitments will be included in the estimate result and discounts the commitment entitles will be included in the workload cost estimates. A maximum of 100 workloads can be provided.
      { # Commitments give you the ability to pay a recurring fee in exchange for a benefit, such as a discount for your use. For example, this object might contain details of a [spend-based committed use discount (CUD)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds#spend_based_commitments). Within a CostScenario, adding a commitment includes the cost of the commitment and any discounts.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A name for this commitment. All commitments in a CostScenario must have unique names. Each name may be at most 128 characters long.

Duration must be at least 1 hour (3,600 seconds) and at most 10 years (315,360,000 seconds). The calculations for years and months are based on a 730-hour (2,628,000-second) month. For durations longer than one month (2,628,000 seconds), the duration is rounded up to the next month, so the estimate shows you the costs for full months. For example, a duration of 3,232,800 seconds (roughly 5 weeks) is rounded up to 2 months.
