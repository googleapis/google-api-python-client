<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, endpointId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates an endpoint, and returns the new endpoint.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the service that this endpoint provides. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An individual endpoint that provides a service. The service must already exist to create an endpoint.
  &quot;address&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An IPv4 or IPv6 address. Service Directory rejects bad addresses like: * `8.8.8` * `8.8.8.8:53` * `test:bad:address` * `[::1]` * `[::1]:8080` Limited to 45 characters.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the endpoint was created.
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Optional. Metadata for the endpoint. This data can be consumed by service clients. Restrictions: * The entire metadata dictionary may contain up to 512 characters, spread accoss all key-value pairs. Metadata that goes beyond this limit are rejected * Valid metadata keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (/). The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/). Metadata that fails to meet these requirements are rejected Note: This field is equivalent to the `annotations` field in the v1 API. They have the same syntax and read/write to the same location in Service Directory.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The resource name for the endpoint in the format `projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*/endpoints/*`.
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The Google Compute Engine network (VPC) of the endpoint in the format `projects//locations/global/networks/*`. The project must be specified by project number (project id is rejected). Incorrectly formatted networks are rejected, but no other validation is performed on this field (ex. network or project existence, reachability, or permissions).
  &quot;port&quot;: 42, # Optional. Service Directory rejects values outside of `[0, 65535]`.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the endpoint was last updated.
}

  endpointId: string, Required. The Resource ID must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all endpoints.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the service whose endpoints you&#x27;d like to list. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. The filter to list results by. General `filter` string syntax: ` ()` * `` can be `name`, `address`, `port`, `metadata.` for map field, or `attributes.` for attributes field * `` can be `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=`, `!=`, `=`, `:`. Of which `:` means `HAS`, and is roughly the same as `=` * `` must be the same data type as field * `` can be `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` Examples of valid filters: * `metadata.owner` returns endpoints that have a metadata with the key `owner`, this is the same as `metadata:owner` * `metadata.protocol=gRPC` returns endpoints that have key/value `protocol=gRPC` * `address=192.108.1.105` returns endpoints that have this address * `port&gt;8080` returns endpoints that have port number larger than 8080 * `name&gt;projects/my-project/locations/us-east1/namespaces/my-namespace/services/my-service/endpoints/endpoint-c` returns endpoints that have name that is alphabetically later than the string, so &quot;endpoint-e&quot; is returned but &quot;endpoint-a&quot; is not * `metadata.owner!=sd AND metadata.foo=bar` returns endpoints that have `owner` in metadata key but value is not `sd` AND have key/value `foo=bar` * `doesnotexist.foo=bar` returns an empty list. Note that endpoint doesn&#x27;t have a field called &quot;doesnotexist&quot;. Since the filter does not match any endpoints, it returns no results * `attributes.kubernetes_resource_type=KUBERNETES_RESOURCE_TYPE_CLUSTER_ IP` returns endpoints with the corresponding kubernetes_resource_type For more information about filtering, see [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160).
  orderBy: string, Optional. The order to list results by. General `order_by` string syntax: ` () (,)` * `` allows values: `name`, `address`, `port` * `` ascending or descending order by ``. If this is left blank, `asc` is used Note that an empty `order_by` string results in default order, which is order by `name` in ascending order.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of items to return.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The next_page_token value returned from a previous List request, if any.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
