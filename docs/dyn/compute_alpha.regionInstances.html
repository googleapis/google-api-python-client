  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

This should not be used to guess when the operation will be complete. This number should monotonically increase as the operation progresses.
  &quot;region&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the region where the operation resides. Only applicable when performing regional operations.
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
  &quot;selfLinkWithId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with the resource id.
  &quot;startTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The time that this operation was started by the server. This value is in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The status of the operation, which can be one of the following: `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, or `DONE`.
  &quot;statusMessage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] An optional textual description of the current status of the operation.
  &quot;targetId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The unique target ID, which identifies a specific incarnation of the target resource.
  &quot;targetLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the resource that the operation modifies. For operations related to creating a snapshot, this points to the persistent disk that the snapshot was created from.
  &quot;user&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] User who requested the operation, for example: `user@example.com`.
  &quot;warnings&quot;: [ # [Output Only] If warning messages are generated during processing of the operation, this field will be populated.
    {
      &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A warning code, if applicable. For example, Compute Engine returns NO_RESULTS_ON_PAGE if there are no results in the response.
      &quot;data&quot;: [ # [Output Only] Metadata about this warning in key: value format. For example:
          # &quot;data&quot;: [ { &quot;key&quot;: &quot;scope&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;zones/us-east1-d&quot; }
        {
          &quot;key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding).
          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A warning data value corresponding to the key.
        },
      ],

    },
  ],
  &quot;zone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the zone where the operation resides. Only applicable when performing per-zone operations.
