<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getExecutionDetails">getExecutionDetails(projectId, location, jobId, stageId, endTime=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, startTime=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Request detailed information about the execution status of a stage of the job. EXPERIMENTAL. This API is subject to change or removal without notice.

Args:
  projectId: string, A project id. (required)
  location: string, The [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) that contains the job specified by job_id. (required)
  jobId: string, The job to get execution details for. (required)
  stageId: string, The stage for which to fetch information. (required)
  endTime: string, Upper time bound of work items to include, by start time.
  pageSize: integer, If specified, determines the maximum number of work items to return. If unspecified, the service may choose an appropriate default, or may return an arbitrarily large number of results.
  pageToken: string, If supplied, this should be the value of next_page_token returned by an earlier call. This will cause the next page of results to be returned.
  startTime: string, Lower time bound of work items to include, by start time.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
