This type can represent a civil time in one of a few possible ways: * When utc_offset is set and time_zone is unset: a civil time on a calendar day with a particular offset from UTC. * When time_zone is set and utc_offset is unset: a civil time on a calendar day in a particular time zone. * When neither time_zone nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar day in local time. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set. Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also would like to store the user&#x27;s timezone, that can be done in another field.

The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set. Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also would like to store the user&#x27;s timezone, that can be done in another field.

  },
  &quot;incrementalRefreshInterval&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The refresh interval specifically for incremental data syncs. If unset, incremental syncs will use the default from env, set to 3hrs. The minimum is 30 minutes and maximum is 7 days. Applicable to only 3P connectors. When the refresh interval is set to the same value as the incremental refresh interval, incremental sync will be disabled.
  &quot;incrementalSyncDisabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether incremental syncs are paused for this connector. This is independent of auto_run_disabled. Applicable to only 3P connectors. When the refresh interval is set to the same value as the incremental refresh interval, incremental sync will be disabled, i.e. set to true.
  &quot;jsonParams&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required data connector parameters in json string format.
  &quot;kmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Input only. The KMS key to be used to protect the DataStores managed by this connector.

  &quot;latestPauseTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The most recent timestamp when this DataConnector was paused, affecting all functionalities such as data synchronization. Pausing a connector has the following effects: - All functionalities, including data synchronization, are halted. - Any ongoing data synchronization job will be canceled. - No future data synchronization runs will be scheduled nor can be triggered.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The full resource name of the Data Connector. Format: `projects/*/locations/*/collections/*/dataConnector`.
  &quot;nextSyncTime&quot;: { # Represents civil time (or occasionally physical time). This type can represent a civil time in one of a few possible ways: * When utc_offset is set and time_zone is unset: a civil time on a calendar day with a particular offset from UTC. * When time_zone is set and utc_offset is unset: a civil time on a calendar day in a particular time zone. * When neither time_zone nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar day in local time. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set. Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also would like to store the user&#x27;s timezone, that can be done in another field. This type is more flexible than some applications may want. Make sure to document and validate your application&#x27;s limitations. # Defines the scheduled time for the next data synchronization. This field requires hour , minute, and time_zone from the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). This is utilized when the data connector has a refresh interval greater than 1 day. When the hours or minutes are not specified, we will assume a sync time of 0:00. The user must provide a time zone to avoid ambiguity.

    &quot;seconds&quot;: 42, # Optional. Seconds of minutes of the time. Must normally be from 0 to 59, defaults to 0. An API may allow the value 60 if it allows leap-seconds.
