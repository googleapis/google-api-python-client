<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#acknowledge">acknowledge(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Acknowledges the messages associated with the `ack_ids` in the `AcknowledgeRequest`. The Pub/Sub system can remove the relevant messages from the subscription. Acknowledging a message whose ack deadline has expired may succeed, but such a message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging a message more than once will not result in an error.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#close">close()</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Close httplib2 connections.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#create">create(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Creates a subscription to a given topic. See the [resource name rules] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). If the subscription already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`. If the corresponding topic doesn't exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this subscription on the same project as the topic, conforming to the [resource name format] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). The generated name is populated in the returned Subscription object. Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#delete">delete(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Deletes an existing subscription. All messages retained in the subscription are immediately dropped. Calls to `Pull` after deletion will return `NOT_FOUND`. After a subscription is deleted, a new one may be created with the same name, but the new one has no association with the old subscription or its topic unless the same topic is specified.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#detach">detach(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Detaches a subscription from this topic. All messages retained in the subscription are dropped. Subsequent `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the endpoint will stop.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#get">get(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets the configuration details of a subscription.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, options_requestedPolicyVersion=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#list">list(project, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#modifyAckDeadline">modifyAckDeadline(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Modifies the ack deadline for a specific message. This method is useful to indicate that more time is needed to process a message by the subscriber, or to make the message available for redelivery if the processing was interrupted. Note that this does not modify the subscription-level `ackDeadlineSeconds` used for subsequent messages.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#modifyPushConfig">modifyPushConfig(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Modifies the `PushConfig` for a specified subscription. This may be used to change a push subscription to a pull one (signified by an empty `PushConfig`) or vice versa, or change the endpoint URL and other attributes of a push subscription. Messages will accumulate for delivery continuously through the call regardless of changes to the `PushConfig`.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#patch">patch(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Updates an existing subscription. Note that certain properties of a subscription, such as its topic, are not modifiable.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#pull">pull(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Pulls messages from the server.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#seek">seek(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Seeks an existing subscription to a point in time or to a given snapshot, whichever is provided in the request. Snapshots are used in [Seek] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. Note that both the subscription and the snapshot must be on the same topic.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces any existing policy. Can return `NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.</p>
<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="acknowledge">acknowledge(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Acknowledges the messages associated with the `ack_ids` in the `AcknowledgeRequest`. The Pub/Sub system can remove the relevant messages from the subscription. Acknowledging a message whose ack deadline has expired may succeed, but such a message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging a message more than once will not result in an error.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The subscription whose message is being acknowledged. Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the Acknowledge method.
  &quot;ackIds&quot;: [ # Required. The acknowledgment ID for the messages being acknowledged that was returned by the Pub/Sub system in the `Pull` response. Must not be empty.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="close">close()</code>
  <pre>Close httplib2 connections.</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a subscription to a given topic. See the [resource name rules] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). If the subscription already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`. If the corresponding topic doesn&#x27;t exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this subscription on the same project as the topic, conforming to the [resource name format] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). The generated name is populated in the returned Subscription object. Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the subscription. It must have the format `&quot;projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}&quot;`. `{subscription}` must start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`), plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with `&quot;goog&quot;`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A subscription resource. If none of `push_config` or `bigquery_config` is set, then the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods. At most one of these fields may be set.
  &quot;ackDeadlineSeconds&quot;: 42, # The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be _outstanding_. During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.
  &quot;bigqueryConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for a BigQuery subscription. # If delivery to BigQuery is used with this subscription, this field is used to configure it.
    &quot;dropUnknownFields&quot;: True or False, # When true and use_topic_schema is true, any fields that are a part of the topic schema that are not part of the BigQuery table schema are dropped when writing to BigQuery. Otherwise, the schemas must be kept in sync and any messages with extra fields are not written and remain in the subscription&#x27;s backlog.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. An output-only field that indicates whether or not the subscription can receive messages.
    &quot;table&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the table to which to write data, of the form {projectId}.{datasetId}.{tableId}
    &quot;useTopicSchema&quot;: True or False, # When true, use the topic&#x27;s schema as the columns to write to in BigQuery, if it exists.
    &quot;writeMetadata&quot;: True or False, # When true, write the subscription name, message_id, publish_time, attributes, and ordering_key to additional columns in the table. The subscription name, message_id, and publish_time fields are put in their own columns while all other message properties (other than data) are written to a JSON object in the attributes column.
  },
  &quot;deadLetterPolicy&quot;: { # Dead lettering is done on a best effort basis. The same message might be dead lettered multiple times. If validation on any of the fields fails at subscription creation/updation, the create/update subscription request will fail. # A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering is disabled. The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscriptions&#x27;s parent project (i.e., service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
    &quot;deadLetterTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be published. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`.The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with the enclosing subscription&#x27;s parent project (i.e., service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have permission to Publish() to this topic. The operation will fail if the topic does not exist. Users should ensure that there is a subscription attached to this topic since messages published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.
    &quot;maxDeliveryAttempts&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must be between 5 and 100. The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of NACKs and number of times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message). A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines. This field will be honored on a best effort basis. If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.
  },
  &quot;detached&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic. Detached subscriptions don&#x27;t receive messages from their topic and don&#x27;t retain any backlog. `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the endpoint will not be made.
  &quot;enableExactlyOnceDelivery&quot;: True or False, # If true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the delivery of a message with a given value of `message_id` on this subscription: * The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent before the message&#x27;s acknowledgement deadline expires. * An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber. Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a message when `enable_exactly_once_delivery` is true if the message was published multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are considered distinct by Pub/Sub and have distinct `message_id` values.
  &quot;enableMessageOrdering&quot;: True or False, # If true, messages published with the same `ordering_key` in `PubsubMessage` will be delivered to the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be delivered in any order.
  &quot;expirationPolicy&quot;: { # A policy that specifies the conditions for resource expiration (i.e., automatic resource deletion). # A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription&#x27;s expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription. If `expiration_policy` is not set, a *default policy* with `ttl` of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for `expiration_policy.ttl` is 1 day. If `expiration_policy` is set, but `expiration_policy.ttl` is not set, the subscription never expires.
    &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the &quot;time-to-live&quot; duration for an associated resource. The resource expires if it is not active for a period of `ttl`. The definition of &quot;activity&quot; depends on the type of the associated resource. The minimum and maximum allowed values for `ttl` depend on the type of the associated resource, as well. If `ttl` is not set, the associated resource never expires.
  },
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An expression written in the Pub/Sub [filter language](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering). If non-empty, then only `PubsubMessage`s whose `attributes` field matches the filter are delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered out.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # See [Creating and managing labels](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels).
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;messageRetentionDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription&#x27;s backlog, from the moment a message is published. If `retain_acked_messages` is true, then this also configures the retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a `Seek` can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7 days or less than 10 minutes.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the subscription. It must have the format `&quot;projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}&quot;`. `{subscription}` must start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`), plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with `&quot;goog&quot;`.
  &quot;pushConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for a push delivery endpoint. # If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to configure it.
    &quot;attributes&quot;: { # Endpoint configuration attributes that can be used to control different aspects of the message delivery. The only currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata). If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription` calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute. The only supported values for the `x-goog-version` attribute are: * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API. For example: `attributes { &quot;x-goog-version&quot;: &quot;v1&quot; }`
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,

      &quot;audience&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience value is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple values (array) for the audience field is not supported. More info about the OIDC JWT token audience here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3 Note: if not specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used.
      &quot;serviceAccountEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,

  },
  &quot;retainAckedMessages&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription&#x27;s backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the `message_retention_duration` window. This must be true if you would like to [`Seek` to a timestamp] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time) in the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.
  &quot;retryPolicy&quot;: { # A policy that specifies how Cloud Pub/Sub retries message delivery. Retry delay will be exponential based on provided minimum and maximum backoffs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message. Retry Policy is implemented on a best effort basis. At times, the delay between consecutive deliveries may not match the configuration. That is, delay can be more or less than configured backoff. # A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message.
    &quot;maximumBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
    &quot;minimumBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
  },
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. An output-only field indicating whether or not the subscription can receive messages.
  &quot;topic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving messages. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. The value of this field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been deleted.
  &quot;topicMessageRetentionDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a message is retained after it is published to the subscription&#x27;s topic. If this field is set, messages published to the subscription&#x27;s topic in the last `topic_message_retention_duration` are always available to subscribers. See the `message_retention_duration` field in `Topic`. This field is set only in responses from the server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes an existing subscription. All messages retained in the subscription are immediately dropped. Calls to `Pull` after deletion will return `NOT_FOUND`. After a subscription is deleted, a new one may be created with the same name, but the new one has no association with the old subscription or its topic unless the same topic is specified.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The subscription to delete. Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="detach">detach(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Detaches a subscription from this topic. All messages retained in the subscription are dropped. Subsequent `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the endpoint will stop.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The subscription to detach. Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be _outstanding_. During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be _outstanding_. During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.

An ack_deadline exceeds event is whenever a message is not acknowledged within ack_deadline. Note that ack_deadline is initially Subscription.ackDeadlineSeconds, but may get extended automatically by the client library. Upon the first delivery of a given message, `delivery_attempt` will have a value of 1. The value is calculated at best effort and is approximate.

  &quot;time&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time to seek to. Messages retained in the subscription that were published before this time are marked as acknowledged, and messages retained in the subscription that were published after this time are marked as unacknowledged. Note that this operation affects only those messages retained in the subscription (configured by the combination of `message_retention_duration` and `retain_acked_messages`). For example, if `time` corresponds to a point before the message retention window (or to a point before the system&#x27;s notion of the subscription creation time), only retained messages will be marked as unacknowledged, and already-expunged messages will not be restored.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`.

    &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
