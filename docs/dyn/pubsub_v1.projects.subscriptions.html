<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="acknowledge">acknowledge(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Acknowledges the messages associated with the `ack_ids` in the
`AcknowledgeRequest`. The Pub/Sub system can remove the relevant messages
from the subscription.

Acknowledging a message whose ack deadline has expired may succeed,
but such a message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging a message more
than once will not result in an error.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The subscription whose message is being acknowledged.
Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the Acknowledge method.
    &quot;ackIds&quot;: [ # Required. The acknowledgment ID for the messages being acknowledged that was returned
        # by the Pub/Sub system in the `Pull` response. Must not be empty.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a subscription to a given topic. See the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names&quot;&gt;
resource name rules&lt;/a&gt;.
If the subscription already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
If the corresponding topic doesn&#x27;t exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`.

If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random
name for this subscription on the same project as the topic, conforming
to the
[resource name
format](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). The
generated name is populated in the returned Subscription object. Note that
for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the subscription. It must have the format
`&quot;projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}&quot;`. `{subscription}` must
start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers
(`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`),
plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters
in length, and it must not start with `&quot;goog&quot;`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;pushConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for a push delivery endpoint. # If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is
      # used to configure it. An empty `pushConfig` signifies that the subscriber

        # aspects of the message delivery.

        # use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute

        #
        # If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to
        # the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a
        # `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription`
        # calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was
        # created without this attribute.

        # * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.

  <pre>Modifies the `PushConfig` for a specified subscription.

This may be used to change a push subscription to a pull one (signified by
an empty `PushConfig`) or vice versa, or change the endpoint URL and other

continuously through the call regardless of changes to the `PushConfig`.

Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview&quot;&gt;Seek&lt;/a&gt;

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more

    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

        # allowed.
