<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#acknowledge">acknowledge(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Acknowledges the messages associated with the `ack_ids` in the `AcknowledgeRequest`. The Pub/Sub system can remove the relevant messages from the subscription. Acknowledging a message whose ack deadline has expired may succeed, but such a message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging a message more than once will not result in an error.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#close">close()</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Close httplib2 connections.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#create">create(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Creates a subscription to a given topic. See the [resource name rules] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). If the subscription already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`. If the corresponding topic doesn't exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this subscription on the same project as the topic, conforming to the [resource name format] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). The generated name is populated in the returned Subscription object. Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#delete">delete(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Deletes an existing subscription. All messages retained in the subscription are immediately dropped. Calls to `Pull` after deletion will return `NOT_FOUND`. After a subscription is deleted, a new one may be created with the same name, but the new one has no association with the old subscription or its topic unless the same topic is specified.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#detach">detach(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Detaches a subscription from this topic. All messages retained in the subscription are dropped. Subsequent `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the endpoint will stop.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#get">get(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets the configuration details of a subscription.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, options_requestedPolicyVersion=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#list">list(project, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Lists matching subscriptions.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Retrieves the next page of results.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#modifyAckDeadline">modifyAckDeadline(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Modifies the ack deadline for a specific message. This method is useful to indicate that more time is needed to process a message by the subscriber, or to make the message available for redelivery if the processing was interrupted. Note that this does not modify the subscription-level `ackDeadlineSeconds` used for subsequent messages.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#modifyPushConfig">modifyPushConfig(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Modifies the `PushConfig` for a specified subscription. This may be used to change a push subscription to a pull one (signified by an empty `PushConfig`) or vice versa, or change the endpoint URL and other attributes of a push subscription. Messages will accumulate for delivery continuously through the call regardless of changes to the `PushConfig`.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#patch">patch(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Updates an existing subscription. Note that certain properties of a subscription, such as its topic, are not modifiable.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#pull">pull(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Pulls messages from the server. The server may return `UNAVAILABLE` if there are too many concurrent pull requests pending for the given subscription.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#seek">seek(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Seeks an existing subscription to a point in time or to a given snapshot, whichever is provided in the request. Snapshots are used in [Seek] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. Note that both the subscription and the snapshot must be on the same topic.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces any existing policy. Can return `NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.</p>
<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="acknowledge">acknowledge(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Acknowledges the messages associated with the `ack_ids` in the `AcknowledgeRequest`. The Pub/Sub system can remove the relevant messages from the subscription. Acknowledging a message whose ack deadline has expired may succeed, but such a message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging a message more than once will not result in an error.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The subscription whose message is being acknowledged. Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the Acknowledge method.
  &quot;ackIds&quot;: [ # Required. The acknowledgment ID for the messages being acknowledged that was returned by the Pub/Sub system in the `Pull` response. Must not be empty.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="close">close()</code>
  <pre>Close httplib2 connections.</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a subscription to a given topic. See the [resource name rules] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). If the subscription already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`. If the corresponding topic doesn&#x27;t exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this subscription on the same project as the topic, conforming to the [resource name format] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). The generated name is populated in the returned Subscription object. Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the subscription. It must have the format `&quot;projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}&quot;`. `{subscription}` must start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`), plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with `&quot;goog&quot;`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A subscription resource.
  &quot;ackDeadlineSeconds&quot;: 42, # The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be *outstanding*. During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.
  &quot;deadLetterPolicy&quot;: { # Dead lettering is done on a best effort basis. The same message might be dead lettered multiple times. If validation on any of the fields fails at subscription creation/updation, the create/update subscription request will fail. # A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering is disabled. The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscriptions&#x27;s parent project (i.e., service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
    &quot;deadLetterTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be published. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`.The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with the enclosing subscription&#x27;s parent project (i.e., service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have permission to Publish() to this topic. The operation will fail if the topic does not exist. Users should ensure that there is a subscription attached to this topic since messages published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.
    &quot;maxDeliveryAttempts&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must be between 5 and 100. The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of NACKs and number of times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message). A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines. This field will be honored on a best effort basis. If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.
  },
  &quot;detached&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic. Detached subscriptions don&#x27;t receive messages from their topic and don&#x27;t retain any backlog. `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the endpoint will not be made.
  &quot;enableMessageOrdering&quot;: True or False, # If true, messages published with the same `ordering_key` in `PubsubMessage` will be delivered to the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be delivered in any order.
  &quot;expirationPolicy&quot;: { # A policy that specifies the conditions for resource expiration (i.e., automatic resource deletion). # A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription&#x27;s expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription. If `expiration_policy` is not set, a *default policy* with `ttl` of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for `expiration_policy.ttl` is 1 day.
    &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the &quot;time-to-live&quot; duration for an associated resource. The resource expires if it is not active for a period of `ttl`. The definition of &quot;activity&quot; depends on the type of the associated resource. The minimum and maximum allowed values for `ttl` depend on the type of the associated resource, as well. If `ttl` is not set, the associated resource never expires.
  },
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An expression written in the Pub/Sub [filter language](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering). If non-empty, then only `PubsubMessage`s whose `attributes` field matches the filter are delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered out.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # See Creating and managing labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;messageRetentionDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription&#x27;s backlog, from the moment a message is published. If `retain_acked_messages` is true, then this also configures the retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a `Seek` can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7 days or less than 10 minutes.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the subscription. It must have the format `&quot;projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}&quot;`. `{subscription}` must start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`), plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with `&quot;goog&quot;`.
  &quot;pushConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for a push delivery endpoint. # If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to configure it. An empty `pushConfig` signifies that the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods.
    &quot;attributes&quot;: { # Endpoint configuration attributes that can be used to control different aspects of the message delivery. The only currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata). If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription` calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute. The only supported values for the `x-goog-version` attribute are: * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API. For example: attributes { &quot;x-goog-version&quot;: &quot;v1&quot; }
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
    &quot;oidcToken&quot;: { # Contains information needed for generating an [OpenID Connect token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect). # If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as an `Authorization` header in the HTTP request for every pushed message.
      &quot;audience&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience value is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple values (array) for the audience field is not supported. More info about the OIDC JWT token audience here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3 Note: if not specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used.
      &quot;serviceAccountEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Service account email](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) to be used for generating the OIDC token. The caller (for CreateSubscription, UpdateSubscription, and ModifyPushConfig RPCs) must have the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account.
    },
    &quot;pushEndpoint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed. For example, a Webhook endpoint might use `https://example.com/push`.
  },
  &quot;retainAckedMessages&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription&#x27;s backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the `message_retention_duration` window. This must be true if you would like to [`Seek` to a timestamp] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time) in the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.
  &quot;retryPolicy&quot;: { # A policy that specifies how Cloud Pub/Sub retries message delivery. Retry delay will be exponential based on provided minimum and maximum backoffs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message. Retry Policy is implemented on a best effort basis. At times, the delay between consecutive deliveries may not match the configuration. That is, delay can be more or less than configured backoff. # A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message.
    &quot;maximumBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
    &quot;minimumBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
  },
  &quot;topic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving messages. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. The value of this field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been deleted.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes an existing subscription. All messages retained in the subscription are immediately dropped. Calls to `Pull` after deletion will return `NOT_FOUND`. After a subscription is deleted, a new one may be created with the same name, but the new one has no association with the old subscription or its topic unless the same topic is specified.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The subscription to delete. Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="detach">detach(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Detaches a subscription from this topic. All messages retained in the subscription are dropped. Subsequent `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the endpoint will stop.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The subscription to detach. Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}`. (required)

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="modifyAckDeadline">modifyAckDeadline(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Modifies the ack deadline for a specific message. This method is useful to indicate that more time is needed to process a message by the subscriber, or to make the message available for redelivery if the processing was interrupted. Note that this does not modify the subscription-level `ackDeadlineSeconds` used for subsequent messages.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The name of the subscription. Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. (required)

  &quot;ackDeadlineSeconds&quot;: 42, # Required. The new ack deadline with respect to the time this request was sent to the Pub/Sub system. For example, if the value is 10, the new ack deadline will expire 10 seconds after the `ModifyAckDeadline` call was made. Specifying zero might immediately make the message available for delivery to another subscriber client. This typically results in an increase in the rate of message redeliveries (that is, duplicates). The minimum deadline you can specify is 0 seconds. The maximum deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="pull">pull(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Pulls messages from the server. The server may return `UNAVAILABLE` if there are too many concurrent pull requests pending for the given subscription.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The subscription from which messages should be pulled. Format is `projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `Pull` method.
  &quot;maxMessages&quot;: 42, # Required. The maximum number of messages to return for this request. Must be a positive integer. The Pub/Sub system may return fewer than the number specified.
  &quot;returnImmediately&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If this field set to true, the system will respond immediately even if it there are no messages available to return in the `Pull` response. Otherwise, the system may wait (for a bounded amount of time) until at least one message is available, rather than returning no messages. Warning: setting this field to `true` is discouraged because it adversely impacts the performance of `Pull` operations. We recommend that users do not set this field.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response for the `Pull` method.
  &quot;receivedMessages&quot;: [ # Received Pub/Sub messages. The list will be empty if there are no more messages available in the backlog. For JSON, the response can be entirely empty. The Pub/Sub system may return fewer than the `maxMessages` requested even if there are more messages available in the backlog.

More precisely, this is 1 + (number of NACKs) + (number of ack_deadline exceeds) for this message. A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. An ack_deadline exceeds event is whenever a message is not acknowledged within ack_deadline. Note that ack_deadline is initially Subscription.ackDeadlineSeconds, but may get extended automatically by the client library. Upon the first delivery of a given message, `delivery_attempt` will have a value of 1. The value is calculated at best effort and is approximate. If a DeadLetterPolicy is not set on the subscription, this will be 0.
      &quot;message&quot;: { # A message that is published by publishers and consumed by subscribers. The message must contain either a non-empty data field or at least one attribute.

This value may be read by a subscriber that receives a `PubsubMessage` via a `Pull` call or a push delivery. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.
        &quot;orderingKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If non-empty, identifies related messages for which publish order should be respected. If a `Subscription` has `enable_message_ordering` set to `true`, messages published with the same non-empty `ordering_key` value will be delivered to subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. All `PubsubMessage`s published in a given `PublishRequest` must specify the same `ordering_key` value.
        &quot;publishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time at which the message was published, populated by the server when it receives the `Publish` call. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="seek">seek(subscription, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Seeks an existing subscription to a point in time or to a given snapshot, whichever is provided in the request. Snapshots are used in [Seek] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot. Note that both the subscription and the snapshot must be on the same topic.

Args:
  subscription: string, Required. The subscription to affect. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `Seek` method.
  &quot;snapshot&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The snapshot to seek to. The snapshot&#x27;s topic must be the same as that of the provided subscription. Format is `projects/{project}/snapshots/{snap}`.
  &quot;time&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time to seek to. Messages retained in the subscription that were published before this time are marked as acknowledged, and messages retained in the subscription that were published after this time are marked as unacknowledged. Note that this operation affects only those messages retained in the subscription (configured by the combination of `message_retention_duration` and `retain_acked_messages`). For example, if `time` corresponds to a point before the message retention window (or to a point before the system&#x27;s notion of the subscription creation time), only retained messages will be marked as unacknowledged, and already-expunged messages will not be restored.
