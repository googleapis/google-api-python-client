<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(projectId, traceId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a single trace by its ID.

Args:
  projectId: string, ID of the Cloud project where the trace data is stored. (required)
  traceId: string, ID of the trace to return. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A trace describes how long it takes for an application to perform an operation. It consists of a set of spans, each of which represent a single timed event within the operation.
    "projectId": "A String", # Project ID of the Cloud project where the trace data is stored.
    "traceId": "A String", # Globally unique identifier for the trace. This identifier is a 128-bit numeric value formatted as a 32-byte hex string.
    "spans": [ # Collection of spans in the trace.
      { # A span represents a single timed event within a trace. Spans can be nested and form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes the end-to-end latency of an operation and, optionally, one or more subspans for its suboperations. Spans do not need to be contiguous. There may be gaps between spans in a trace.
        "kind": "A String", # Distinguishes between spans generated in a particular context. For example, two spans with the same name may be distinguished using `RPC_CLIENT` and `RPC_SERVER` to identify queueing latency associated with the span.
        "name": "A String", # Name of the trace. The trace name is sanitized and displayed in the Stackdriver Trace tool in the {% dynamic print site_values.console_name %}. The name may be a method name or some other per-call site name. For the same executable and the same call point, a best practice is to use a consistent name, which makes it easier to correlate cross-trace spans.
        "labels": { # Collection of labels associated with the span.
          "a_key": "A String",
        },
        "parentSpanId": "A String", # ID of the parent span, if any. Optional.
        "startTime": "A String", # Start time of the span in nanoseconds from the UNIX epoch.
        "spanId": "A String", # Identifier for the span. This identifier must be unique within a trace.
        "endTime": "A String", # End time of the span in nanoseconds from the UNIX epoch.
      },

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(projectId, orderBy=None, startTime=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None, pageToken=None, filter=None, endTime=None, view=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns of a list of traces that match the specified filter conditions.

Args:
  projectId: string, ID of the Cloud project where the trace data is stored. (required)
  orderBy: string, Field used to sort the returned traces. Optional. Can be one of the following: * `trace_id` * `name` (`name` field of root span in the trace) * `duration` (difference between `end_time` and `start_time` fields of the root span) * `start` (`start_time` field of the root span) Descending order can be specified by appending `desc` to the sort field (for example, `name desc`). Only one sort field is permitted.
  startTime: string, End of the time interval (inclusive) during which the trace data was collected from the application.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of traces to return. If not specified or <= 0, the implementation selects a reasonable value. The implementation may return fewer traces than the requested page size. Optional.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
  pageToken: string, Token identifying the page of results to return. If provided, use the value of the `next_page_token` field from a previous request. Optional.
  filter: string, An optional filter for the request.
  endTime: string, Start of the time interval (inclusive) during which the trace data was collected from the application.
  view: string, Type of data returned for traces in the list. Optional. Default is `MINIMAL`.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response message for the `ListTraces` method.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # If defined, indicates that there are more traces that match the request and that this value should be passed to the next request to continue retrieving additional traces.
    "traces": [ # List of trace records returned.
      { # A trace describes how long it takes for an application to perform an operation. It consists of a set of spans, each of which represent a single timed event within the operation.
        "projectId": "A String", # Project ID of the Cloud project where the trace data is stored.
        "traceId": "A String", # Globally unique identifier for the trace. This identifier is a 128-bit numeric value formatted as a 32-byte hex string.
        "spans": [ # Collection of spans in the trace.
          { # A span represents a single timed event within a trace. Spans can be nested and form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes the end-to-end latency of an operation and, optionally, one or more subspans for its suboperations. Spans do not need to be contiguous. There may be gaps between spans in a trace.
            "kind": "A String", # Distinguishes between spans generated in a particular context. For example, two spans with the same name may be distinguished using `RPC_CLIENT` and `RPC_SERVER` to identify queueing latency associated with the span.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
