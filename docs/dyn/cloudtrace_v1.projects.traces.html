<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(projectId, traceId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a single trace by its ID.

Args:
  projectId: string, ID of the Cloud project where the trace data is stored. (required)
  traceId: string, ID of the trace to return. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A trace describes how long it takes for an application to perform an
      # operation. It consists of a set of spans, each of which represent a single

          # end-to-end latency of an operation and, optionally, one or more subspans for

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(projectId, orderBy=None, startTime=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None, pageToken=None, filter=None, endTime=None, view=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns of a list of traces that match the specified filter conditions.

Args:
  projectId: string, ID of the Cloud project where the trace data is stored. (required)
  orderBy: string, Field used to sort the returned traces. Optional.
Can be one of the following:

*   `trace_id`
*   `name` (`name` field of root span in the trace)
*   `duration` (difference between `end_time` and `start_time` fields of
     the root span)
*   `start` (`start_time` field of the root span)

Descending order can be specified by appending `desc` to the sort field
(for example, `name desc`).

Only one sort field is permitted.
  startTime: string, Start of the time interval (inclusive) during which the trace data was
collected from the application.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of traces to return. If not specified or <= 0, the
implementation selects a reasonable value.  The implementation may
return fewer traces than the requested page size. Optional.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  pageToken: string, Token identifying the page of results to return. If provided, use the
value of the `next_page_token` field from a previous request. Optional.
  filter: string, An optional filter against labels for the request.

By default, searches use prefix matching. To specify exact match, prepend
a plus symbol (`+`) to the search term.
Multiple terms are ANDed. Syntax:

*   `root:NAME_PREFIX` or `NAME_PREFIX`: Return traces where any root
    span starts with `NAME_PREFIX`.
*   `+root:NAME` or `+NAME`: Return traces where any root span's name is
    exactly `NAME`.
*   `span:NAME_PREFIX`: Return traces where any span starts with
    `NAME_PREFIX`.
*   `+span:NAME`: Return traces where any span's name is exactly
    `NAME`.
*   `latency:DURATION`: Return traces whose overall latency is
    greater or equal to than `DURATION`. Accepted units are nanoseconds
    (`ns`), milliseconds (`ms`), and seconds (`s`). Default is `ms`. For
    example, `latency:24ms` returns traces whose overall latency
    is greater than or equal to 24 milliseconds.
*   `label:LABEL_KEY`: Return all traces containing the specified
    label key (exact match, case-sensitive) regardless of the key:value
    pair's value (including empty values).
*   `LABEL_KEY:VALUE_PREFIX`: Return all traces containing the specified
    label key (exact match, case-sensitive) whose value starts with
    `VALUE_PREFIX`. Both a key and a value must be specified.
*   `+LABEL_KEY:VALUE`: Return all traces containing a key:value pair
    exactly matching the specified text. Both a key and a value must be
    specified.
*   `method:VALUE`: Equivalent to `/http/method:VALUE`.
*   `url:VALUE`: Equivalent to `/http/url:VALUE`.
  endTime: string, End of the time interval (inclusive) during which the trace data was
collected from the application.
  view: string, Type of data returned for traces in the list. Optional. Default is
`MINIMAL`.

  An object of the form:
