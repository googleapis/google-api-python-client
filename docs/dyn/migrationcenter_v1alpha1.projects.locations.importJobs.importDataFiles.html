<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, importDataFileId=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates an import data file.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the parent of the ImportDataFile. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A resource that represents a payload file in an import job.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the file was created.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. User-friendly display name. Maximum length is 256 characters.
  &quot;format&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The payload format.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the file.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the import data file.
  &quot;uploadFileInfo&quot;: { # A resource that contains a URI to which a data file can be uploaded. # Information about a file that is uploaded to a storage service.
    &quot;headers&quot;: { # Output only. The headers that were used to sign the URL.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
    &quot;signedUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Upload URI for the file.
    &quot;uriExpirationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Expiration time of the upload URI.
  },
}

  importDataFileId: string, Required. The ID of the new data file.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
}</pre>
