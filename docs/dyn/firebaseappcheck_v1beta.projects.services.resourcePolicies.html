<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchUpdate">batchUpdate(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Atomically updates the specified ResourcePolicy configurations.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent service name, in the format ``` projects/{project_number}/services/{service_id} ``` The parent collection in the `name` field of any resource being updated must match this field, or the entire batch fails. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the BatchUpdateResourcePolicies method.
  &quot;requests&quot;: [ # Required. The request messages specifying the ResourcePolicy objects to update. A maximum of 100 objects can be updated in a batch.
    { # Request message for the UpdateResourcePolicy method as well as an individual update message for the BatchUpdateResourcePolicies method.
      &quot;resourcePolicy&quot;: { # App Check enforcement policy for a specific resource of a Firebase service supported by App Check. Note that this policy will override the service-level configuration. # Required. The ResourcePolicy to update. The ResourcePolicy&#x27;s `name` field is used to identify the ResourcePolicy to be updated, in the format: ``` projects/{project_number}/services/{service_id}/resourcePolicies/{resource_policy_id} ``` Note that the `service_id` element must be a supported service ID. Currently, the following service IDs are supported: * `oauth2.googleapis.com` (Google Identity for iOS)
        &quot;enforcementMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The App Check enforcement mode for this resource. This will override the EnforcementMode setting on the parent service.
        &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. This etag is strongly validated as defined by RFC 7232.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Identifier. The relative name of the resource policy object, in the format: ``` projects/{project_number}/services/{service_id}/resourcePolicies/{resource_policy_id} ``` Note that the `service_id` element must be a supported service ID.

Service specific name of the resource object to which this policy applies, in the format: * `//oauth2.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/oauthClients/{oauth_client_id}` (Google Identity for iOS) Note that the resource must belong to the service specified in the `name` and be from the same project as this policy, but the resource is allowed to be missing at the time of creation of this policy; in that case, we make a best-effort attempt at respecting this policy, but it may not have any effect until the resource is fully created.
        &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when this resource policy configuration object was most recently updated.
      },
      &quot;updateMask&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A comma-separated list of names of fields in the ResourcePolicy to update. Example: `enforcement_mode`.
    },
  ],
  &quot;updateMask&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A comma-separated list of names of fields in the ResourcePolicy objects to update. Example: `enforcement_mode`.
