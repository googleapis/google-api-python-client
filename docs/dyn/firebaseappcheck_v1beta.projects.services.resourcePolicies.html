<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchUpdate">batchUpdate(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Atomically updates the specified ResourcePolicy configurations.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent project name and the service, in the format ``` projects/{project_number}/services/{service_id} ``` The parent collection in the `name` field of any resource being updated must match this field, or the entire batch fails. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the BatchUpdateResourcePolicies method.
  &quot;requests&quot;: [ # Required. The request messages specifying the ResourcePolicys to update. A maximum of 100 objects can be updated in a batch.
    { # Request message for the UpdateResourcePolicy method as well as an individual update message for the BatchUpdateResourcePolicies method.
      &quot;resourcePolicy&quot;: { # App Check enforcement policy for a specific resource of a Firebase service supported by App Check. Note that this policy will override the Service level enforcement mode configuration. # Required. The ResourcePolicy to update. The ResourcePolicy&#x27;s `name` field is used to identify the ResourcePolicy to be updated, in the format: ``` projects/{project_number}/services/{service_id}/resourcePolicies/{resource_name} ``` Note that the `service_id` element must be a supported service ID. Currently, the following service IDs are supported: * `oauth2.googleapis.com` (Google Identity for iOS) Only the top-level resources are supported for each of the services.

        &quot;enforcementMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The App Check enforcement mode for this resource. This will override the EnforcementMode setting on the service. For new resources that you are creating, you should consider setting an override and enable enforcement on the resource immediately, if there are no outdated clients that can use it.
        &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. This etag is strongly validated.

The relative name of the resource configuration object, in the format: ``` projects/{project_number}/services/{service_id}/resourcePolicies/{resource_policy_id} ``` Note that the `service_id` element must be a supported service ID. Currently, the following service IDs are supported: * `oauth2.googleapis.com` (Google Identity for iOS) `resource_policy_id` is a system-generated UID used as the resource ID for the policy.

    },
  ],
  &quot;updateMask&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A comma-separated list of names of fields in the ResourceConfigurations to update. Example: `enforcement_mode`. If this field is present, the `update_mask` field in the UpdateResourcePolicyRequest messages must all match this field, or the entire batch fails and no updates will be committed.
