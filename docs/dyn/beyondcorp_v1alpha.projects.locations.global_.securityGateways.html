Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource project name of the SecurityGateway location using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/global` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Information about a BeyoncCorp SecurityGateway resource.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An arbitrary user-provided name for the SecurityGateway. Cannot exceed 64 characters.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. Name of the resource.
  &quot;regionConfigs&quot;: [ # Optional. List of regions where the egress connectivity is required.
    { # Message contains the configuration for each supported region for the securityGateway instance.
      &quot;egressIpAddresses&quot;: [ # Output only. External IP addresses that will be used for establishing connection to the egress endpoints.

  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the resource was last modified.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.
  securityGatewayId: string, Optional. User-settable SecurityGateway resource ID. * Must start with a letter. * Must contain between 4-63 characters from `/a-z-/`. * Must end with a number or letter.

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs.

      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, requestId=None, validateOnly=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a single SecurityGateway.

Args:
  name: string, Required. BeyondCorp SecurityGateway name using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/securityGateways/{security_gateway_id}` (required)
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
