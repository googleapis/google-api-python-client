  <pre>Enable multiple services on a project. The operation is atomic: if enabling any service fails, then the entire batch fails, and no state changes occur. To enable a single service, use the `EnableService` method instead.

Args:
  parent: string, Parent to enable services on. An example name would be: `projects/123` where `123` is the project number. The `BatchEnableServices` method currently only supports projects. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the `BatchEnableServices` method.
  &quot;serviceIds&quot;: [ # The identifiers of the services to enable on the project. A valid identifier would be: serviceusage.googleapis.com Enabling services requires that each service is public or is shared with the user enabling the service. A single request can enable a maximum of 20 services at a time. If more than 20 services are specified, the request will fail, and no state changes will occur.

Any version prefix will be replaced by the version of the including interface plus the root path if specified. Example of a simple mixin: package google.acl.v1; service AccessControl { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;; } } package google.storage.v2; service Storage { // rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl); // Get a data record. rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/{resource=**}&quot;; } } Example of a mixin configuration: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are also declared with same name and request/response types in `Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inheriting documentation and annotations as follows: service Storage { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;; } ... } Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`. If the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a relative path under which inherited HTTP paths are placed. Example: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl root: acls This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation: service Storage { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;; } ... }

If the field is not empty, the version in the package name will be verified to be consistent with what is provided here. The versioning schema uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) where the major version number indicates a breaking change and the minor version an additive, non-breaking change. Both version numbers are signals to users what to expect from different versions, and should be carefully chosen based on the product plan. The major version is also reflected in the package name of the interface, which must end in `v`, as in `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can be omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for experimental, non-GA interfaces.

Any version prefix will be replaced by the version of the including interface plus the root path if specified. Example of a simple mixin: package google.acl.v1; service AccessControl { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;; } } package google.storage.v2; service Storage { // rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl); // Get a data record. rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/{resource=**}&quot;; } } Example of a mixin configuration: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are also declared with same name and request/response types in `Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inheriting documentation and annotations as follows: service Storage { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;; } ... } Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`. If the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a relative path under which inherited HTTP paths are placed. Example: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl root: acls This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation: service Storage { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;; } ... }

The versioning schema uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) where the major version number indicates a breaking change and the minor version an additive, non-breaking change. Both version numbers are signals to users what to expect from different versions, and should be carefully chosen based on the product plan. The major version is also reflected in the package name of the interface, which must end in `v`, as in `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can be omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for experimental, non-GA interfaces.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>List all services available to the specified project, and the current state of those services with respect to the project. The list includes all public services, all services for which the calling user has the `servicemanagement.services.bind` permission, and all services that have already been enabled on the project. The list can be filtered to only include services in a specific state, for example to only include services enabled on the project. WARNING: If you need to query enabled services frequently or across an organization, you should use [Cloud Asset Inventory API](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/apis), which provides higher throughput and richer filtering capability.

Args:
  parent: string, Parent to search for services on. An example name would be: `projects/123` where `123` is the project number. (required)
  filter: string, Only list services that conform to the given filter. The allowed filter strings are `state:ENABLED` and `state:DISABLED`.
  pageSize: integer, Requested size of the next page of data. Requested page size cannot exceed 200. If not set, the default page size is 50.
  pageToken: string, Token identifying which result to start with, which is returned by a previous list call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

Any version prefix will be replaced by the version of the including interface plus the root path if specified. Example of a simple mixin: package google.acl.v1; service AccessControl { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;; } } package google.storage.v2; service Storage { // rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl); // Get a data record. rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/{resource=**}&quot;; } } Example of a mixin configuration: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are also declared with same name and request/response types in `Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inheriting documentation and annotations as follows: service Storage { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;; } ... } Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`.

Example: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl root: acls This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation: service Storage { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;; } ... }

The major version is also reflected in the package name of the interface, which must end in `v`, as in `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can be omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for experimental, non-GA interfaces.
