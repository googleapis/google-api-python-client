<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchEnable">batchEnable(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Enable multiple services on a project. The operation is atomic: if enabling
any service fails, then the entire batch fails, and no state changes occur.

Args:
  parent: string, Parent to enable services on.

An example name would be:
`projects/123` where `123` is the project number.

The `BatchEnableServices` method currently only supports projects. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the `BatchEnableServices` method.
    "serviceIds": [ # The identifiers of the services to enable on the project.
        # 
        # A valid identifier would be:
        # serviceusage.googleapis.com
        # 
        # Enabling services requires that each service is public or is shared with
        # the user enabling the service.
        # 
        # Two or more services must be specified. To enable a single service,
        # use the `EnableService` method instead.
        # 
        # A single request can enable a maximum of 20 services at a time. If more
        # than 20 services are specified, the request will fail, and no state changes
        # will occur.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="disable">disable(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Disable a service so that it can no longer be used with a project.
This prevents unintended usage that may cause unexpected billing
charges or security leaks.

It is not valid to call the disable method on a service that is not
currently enabled. Callers will receive a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` status if
the target service is not currently enabled.

Args:
  name: string, Name of the consumer and service to disable the service on.

The enable and disable methods currently only support projects.

An example name would be:
`projects/123/services/serviceusage.googleapis.com` where `123` is the
project number. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

    "disableDependentServices": True or False, # Indicates if services that are enabled and which depend on this service
        # should also be disabled. If not set, an error will be generated if any
        # enabled services depend on the service to be disabled. When set, the
        # service, and any enabled services that depend on it, will be disabled
        # together.

          # The metric based quota configuration works this way:
          # - The service configuration defines a set of metrics.
          # - For API calls, the quota.metric_rules maps methods to metrics with
          #   corresponding costs.
          # - The quota.limits defines limits on the metrics, which will be used for
          #   quota checks at runtime.
          #
          # An example quota configuration in yaml format:
          #
          #    quota:
          #      limits:
          #
          #      - name: apiWriteQpsPerProject
          #        metric: library.googleapis.com/write_calls

          #          STANDARD: 10000
          #
          #
          #      # The metric rules bind all methods to the read_calls metric,
          #      # except for the UpdateBook and DeleteBook methods. These two methods
          #      # are mapped to the write_calls metric, with the UpdateBook method

  <pre>List all services available to the specified project, and the current
state of those services with respect to the project. The list includes
all public services, all services for which the calling user has the
`servicemanagement.services.bind` permission, and all services that have
already been enabled on the project. The list can be filtered to
only include services in a specific state, for example to only include
services enabled on the project.

Args:
  parent: string, Parent to search for services on.

An example name would be:
`projects/123` where `123` is the project number. (required)
  pageSize: integer, Requested size of the next page of data.
Requested page size cannot exceed 200.
 If not set, the default page size is 50.
  pageToken: string, Token identifying which result to start with, which is returned by a
previous list call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, Only list services that conform to the given filter.
The allowed filter strings are `state:ENABLED` and `state:DISABLED`.
