<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="undelete">undelete(alertId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Restores, or "undeletes", an alert that was marked for deletion within the
past 30 days. Attempting to undelete an alert which was marked for deletion
over 30 days ago (which has been removed from the Alert Center database) or
a nonexistent alert returns a `NOT_FOUND` error. Attempting to
undelete an alert which has not been marked for deletion has no effect.

Args:
  alertId: string, Required. The identifier of the alert to undelete. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request to undelete a specific alert that was marked for deletion.
    "customerId": "A String", # Optional. The unique identifier of the G Suite organization account of the
        # customer the alert is associated with.
        # Inferred from the caller identity if not provided.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An alert affecting a customer.
    "updateTime": "A String", # Output only. The time this alert was last updated.
    "endTime": "A String", # Optional. The time the event that caused this alert ceased being active.
        # If provided, the end time must not be earlier than the start time.
        # If not provided, it indicates an ongoing alert.
    "alertId": "A String", # Output only. The unique identifier for the alert.
    "deleted": True or False, # Output only. `True` if this alert is marked for deletion.
    "data": { # Optional. The data associated with this alert, for example
        # google.apps.alertcenter.type.DeviceCompromised.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "customerId": "A String", # Output only. The unique identifier of the Google account of the customer.

        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform alert updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response which contains alerts,
        # and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to update alert to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the alert.
        #
        # If no `etag` is provided in the call to update alert, then the existing
        # alert is overwritten blindly.

      "severity": "A String", # The severity value of the alert. Alert Center will set this field at alert
          # creation time, default's to an empty string when it could not be
          # determined.
          # The supported values for update actions on this field are the following:
          #
