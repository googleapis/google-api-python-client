  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Cloud Filestore backup.
  &quot;capacityGb&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Capacity of the source file share when the backup was created.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the backup was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the backup with 2048 characters or less. Requests with longer descriptions will be rejected.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the backup, in the format projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/backups/{backup_id}.
  &quot;sourceFileShare&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the file share in the source Cloud Filestore instance that the backup is created from.
  &quot;sourceInstance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the source Cloud Filestore instance, in the format projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}, used to create this backup.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
