  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # ETag of the resource.
  &quot;hidden&quot;: True or False, # Flag indicating whether the task is hidden. This is the case if the task had been marked completed when the task list was last cleared. The default is False. This field is read-only.

  &quot;position&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. String indicating the position of the task among its sibling tasks under the same parent task or at the top level. If this string is greater than another task&#x27;s corresponding position string according to lexicographical ordering, the task is positioned after the other task under the same parent task (or at the top level).
