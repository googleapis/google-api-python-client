If the Model has both instance and prediction schemata defined then the tables have columns as follows: The `predictions` table contains instances for which the prediction succeeded, it has columns as per a concatenation of the Model&#x27;s instance and prediction schemata. The `errors` table contains rows for which the prediction has failed, it has instance columns, as per the instance schema, followed by a single &quot;errors&quot; column, which as values has google.rpc.Status represented as a STRUCT, and containing only `code` and `message`.

The order of columns is determined by the BigQuery column order, unless included_fields is populated. included_fields must be populated for specifying field orders. * For `jsonl`, if each line of the JSONL input is an object, included_fields must be populated for specifying field orders. * Does not apply to `csv`, `file-list`, `tf-record`, or `tf-record-gzip`. If not specified, Vertex AI converts the batch prediction input as follows: * For `bigquery` and `csv`, the behavior is the same as `array`. The order of columns is the same as defined in the file or table, unless included_fields is populated. * For `jsonl`, the prediction instance format is determined by each line of the input. * For `tf-record`/`tf-record-gzip`, each record will be converted to an object in the format of `{&quot;b64&quot;: }`, where `` is the Base64-encoded string of the content of the record. * For `file-list`, each file in the list will be converted to an object in the format of `{&quot;b64&quot;: }`, where `` is the Base64-encoded string of the content of the file.

In addition, the batch prediction output will not include the instances. Instead the output will only include the value of the key field, in a field named `key` in the output: * For `jsonl` output format, the output will have a `key` field instead of the `instance` field. * For `csv`/`bigquery` output format, the output will have have a `key` column instead of the instance feature columns.
