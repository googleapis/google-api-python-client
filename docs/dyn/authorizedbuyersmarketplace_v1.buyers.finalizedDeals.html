<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#addCreative">addCreative(deal, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Add creative to be used in the bidding process for a finalized deal. For programmatic guaranteed deals, it's recommended that you associate at least one approved creative with the deal before calling SetReadyToServe, to help reduce the number of bid responses filtered because they don't contain approved creatives. Creatives successfully added to a deal can be found in the Realtime-bidding Creatives API creative.deal_ids. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals. Maximum number of 1000 creatives can be added to a finalized deal.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#close">close()</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Close httplib2 connections.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets a finalized deal given its name.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Lists finalized deals. Use the URL path "/v1/buyers/{accountId}/finalizedDeals" to list finalized deals for the current buyer and its clients. Bidders can use the URL path "/v1/bidders/{accountId}/finalizedDeals" to list finalized deals for the bidder, its buyers and all their clients.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Retrieves the next page of results.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#pause">pause(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Pauses serving of the given finalized deal. This call only pauses the serving status, and does not affect other fields of the finalized deal. Calling this method for an already paused deal has no effect. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#resume">resume(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Resumes serving of the given finalized deal. Calling this method for an running deal has no effect. If a deal is initially paused by the seller, calling this method will not resume serving of the deal until the seller also resumes the deal. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#setReadyToServe">setReadyToServe(deal, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Sets the given finalized deal as ready to serve. By default, deals are ready to serve as soon as they're finalized. A bidder can opt out of this feature by asking to be included in an allowlist. Once opted out, finalized deals belonging to the bidder and its child seats will not start serving until this method is called. This method is useful to the bidders who prefer to not receive bid requests before the creative is ready. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals.</p>

If a deal is initially paused by the seller, calling this method will not resume serving of the deal until the seller also resumes the deal. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Format: `buyers/{accountId}/finalizedDeals/{dealId}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setReadyToServe">setReadyToServe(deal, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the given finalized deal as ready to serve. By default, deals are ready to serve as soon as they&#x27;re finalized. A bidder can opt out of this feature by asking to be included in an allowlist. Once opted out, finalized deals belonging to the bidder and its child seats will not start serving until this method is called. This method is useful to the bidders who prefer to not receive bid requests before the creative is ready. This method only applies to programmatic guaranteed deals.

Args:
  deal: string, Required. Format: `buyers/{accountId}/finalizedDeals/{dealId}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for setting ready to serve for a finalized deal.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
