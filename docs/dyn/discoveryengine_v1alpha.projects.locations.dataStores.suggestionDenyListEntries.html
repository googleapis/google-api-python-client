  <pre>Imports all SuggestionDenyListEntry for a DataStore.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent data store resource name for which to import denylist entries. Follows pattern projects/*/locations/*/collections/*/dataStores/*. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CompletionService.ImportSuggestionDenyListEntries method.
  &quot;gcsSource&quot;: { # Cloud Storage location for input content. # Cloud Storage location for the input content. Only 1 file can be specified that contains all entries to import. Supported values `gcs_source.schema` for autocomplete suggestion deny list entry imports: * `suggestion_deny_list` (default): One JSON [SuggestionDenyListEntry] per line.
    &quot;dataSchema&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The schema to use when parsing the data from the source. Supported values for document imports: * `document` (default): One JSON Document per line. Each document must have a valid Document.id. * `content`: Unstructured data (e.g. PDF, HTML). Each file matched by `input_uris` becomes a document, with the ID set to the first 128 bits of SHA256(URI) encoded as a hex string. * `custom`: One custom data JSON per row in arbitrary format that conforms to the defined Schema of the data store. This can only be used by the GENERIC Data Store vertical. * `csv`: A CSV file with header conforming to the defined Schema of the data store. Each entry after the header is imported as a Document. This can only be used by the GENERIC Data Store vertical. Supported values for user event imports: * `user_event` (default): One JSON UserEvent per line.
    &quot;inputUris&quot;: [ # Required. Cloud Storage URIs to input files. Each URI can be up to 2000 characters long. URIs can match the full object path (for example, `gs://bucket/directory/object.json`) or a pattern matching one or more files, such as `gs://bucket/directory/*.json`. A request can contain at most 100 files (or 100,000 files if `data_schema` is `content`). Each file can be up to 2 GB (or 100 MB if `data_schema` is `content`).
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;inlineSource&quot;: { # The inline source for SuggestionDenyListEntry. # The Inline source for the input content for suggestion deny list entries.
    &quot;entries&quot;: [ # Required. A list of all denylist entries to import. Max of 1000 items.
      { # Suggestion deny list entry identifying the phrase to block from suggestions and the applied operation for the phrase.
        &quot;blockPhrase&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Phrase to block from suggestions served. Can be maximum 125 characters.
        &quot;matchOperator&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The match operator to apply for this phrase. Whether to block the exact phrase, or block any suggestions containing this phrase.
      },
    ],
  },
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {

      },

    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
