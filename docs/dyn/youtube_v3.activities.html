  <pre>Posts a bulletin for a specific channel. (The user submitting the request must be authorized to act on the channel's behalf.)

Note: Even though an activity resource can contain information about actions like a user rating a video or marking a video as a favorite, you need to use other API methods to generate those activity resources. For example, you would use the API's videos.rate() method to rate a video and the playlistItems.insert() method to mark a video as a favorite.

Args:
  part: string, The part parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An activity resource contains information about an action that a particular channel, or user, has taken on YouTube.The actions reported in activity feeds include rating a video, sharing a video, marking a video as a favorite, commenting on a video, uploading a video, and so forth.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(part, pageToken=None, publishedBefore=None, channelId=None, mine=None, maxResults=None, regionCode=None, home=None, publishedAfter=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns a list of channel activity events that match the request criteria. For example, you can retrieve events associated with a particular channel, events associated with the user's subscriptions and Google+ friends, or the YouTube home page feed, which is customized for each user.

Args:
  part: string, The part parameter specifies a comma-separated list of one or more activity resource properties that the API response will include.

If the parameter identifies a property that contains child properties, the child properties will be included in the response. For example, in an activity resource, the snippet property contains other properties that identify the type of activity, a display title for the activity, and so forth. If you set part=snippet, the API response will also contain all of those nested properties. (required)
  pageToken: string, The pageToken parameter identifies a specific page in the result set that should be returned. In an API response, the nextPageToken and prevPageToken properties identify other pages that could be retrieved.
  publishedBefore: string, The publishedBefore parameter specifies the date and time before which an activity must have occurred for that activity to be included in the API response. If the parameter value specifies a day, but not a time, then any activities that occurred that day will be excluded from the result set. The value is specified in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sZ) format.
  channelId: string, The channelId parameter specifies a unique YouTube channel ID. The API will then return a list of that channel's activities.
  mine: boolean, Set this parameter's value to true to retrieve a feed of the authenticated user's activities.
  maxResults: integer, The maxResults parameter specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the result set.
  regionCode: string, The regionCode parameter instructs the API to return results for the specified country. The parameter value is an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. YouTube uses this value when the authorized user's previous activity on YouTube does not provide enough information to generate the activity feed.
  home: boolean, Set this parameter's value to true to retrieve the activity feed that displays on the YouTube home page for the currently authenticated user.
  publishedAfter: string, The publishedAfter parameter specifies the earliest date and time that an activity could have occurred for that activity to be included in the API response. If the parameter value specifies a day, but not a time, then any activities that occurred that day will be included in the result set. The value is specified in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sZ) format.

Returns:
