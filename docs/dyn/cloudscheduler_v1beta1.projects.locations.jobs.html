  <pre>Creates a job.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The location name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Configuration for a job.
    # The maximum allowed size for a job is 100KB.
  &quot;timeZone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting
      # schedule. The value of this field must be a time
      # zone name from the [tz database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database).
      # 
      # Note that some time zones include a provision for
      # daylight savings time. The rules for daylight saving time are
      # determined by the chosen tz. For UTC use the string &quot;utc&quot;. If a
      # time zone is not specified, the default will be in UTC (also known
      # as GMT).
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optionally caller-specified in CreateJob or
      # UpdateJob.
      # 
      # A human-readable description for the job. This string must not contain
      # more than 500 characters.
  &quot;appEngineHttpTarget&quot;: { # App Engine target. The job will be pushed to a job handler by means # App Engine HTTP target.
      # of an HTTP request via an http_method such
      # as HTTP POST, HTTP GET, etc. The job is acknowledged by means of an
      # HTTP response code in the range [200 - 299]. Error 503 is
      # considered an App Engine system error instead of an application
      # error. Requests returning error 503 will be retried regardless of
      # retry configuration and not counted against retry counts. Any other
      # response code, or a failure to receive a response before the
      # deadline, constitutes a failed attempt.
    &quot;body&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Body.
        #
        # HTTP request body. A request body is allowed only if the HTTP method is
        # POST or PUT. It will result in invalid argument error to set a body on a
        # job with an incompatible HttpMethod.
    &quot;relativeUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The relative URI.
        #
        # The relative URL must begin with &quot;/&quot; and must be a valid HTTP relative URL.
        # It can contain a path, query string arguments, and `#` fragments.
        # If the relative URL is empty, then the root path &quot;/&quot; will be used.
        # No spaces are allowed, and the maximum length allowed is 2083 characters.
    &quot;headers&quot;: { # HTTP request headers.
        #
        # This map contains the header field names and values. Headers can be set
        # when the job is created.
        #
        # Cloud Scheduler sets some headers to default values:
        #
        # * `User-Agent`: By default, this header is
        #   `&quot;AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)&quot;`.
        #   This header can be modified, but Cloud Scheduler will append
        #   `&quot;AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)&quot;` to the
        #   modified `User-Agent`.
        # * `X-CloudScheduler`: This header will be set to true.
        #
        # If the job has an body, Cloud Scheduler sets
        # the following headers:
        #
        # * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
        #   `&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;`. The default can be overridden by explictly
        #   setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the job is
        #   created.
        #   For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `&quot;application/json&quot;`.
        # * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Scheduler. This value is
        #   output only. It cannot be changed.
        #
        # The headers below are output only. They cannot be set or overridden:
        #
        # * `X-Google-*`: For Google internal use only.
        # * `X-AppEngine-*`: For Google internal use only.
        #
        # In addition, some App Engine headers, which contain
        # job-specific information, are also be sent to the job handler.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists jobs.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The location name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`. (required)
  pageToken: string, A token identifying a page of results the server will return. To
request the first page results, page_token must be empty. To
request the next page of results, page_token must be the value of
next_page_token returned from
the previous call to ListJobs. It is an error to
switch the value of filter or
order_by while iterating through pages.
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size.

The maximum page size is 500. If unspecified, the page size will
be the maximum. Fewer jobs than requested might be returned,
even if more jobs exist; use next_page_token to determine if more
jobs exist.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

  <pre>Pauses a job.

If a job is paused then the system will stop executing the job
until it is re-enabled via ResumeJob. The
state of the job is stored in state; if paused it
will be set to Job.State.PAUSED. A job must be in Job.State.ENABLED
to be paused.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The job name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/jobs/JOB_ID`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for PauseJob.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    &quot;timeZone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting

  <pre>Resume a job.

This method reenables a job after it has been Job.State.PAUSED. The
state of a job is stored in Job.state; after calling this method it
will be set to Job.State.ENABLED. A job must be in
Job.State.PAUSED to be resumed.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The job name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/jobs/JOB_ID`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for ResumeJob.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  <pre>Forces a job to run now.

When this method is called, Cloud Scheduler will dispatch the job, even
if the job is already running.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The job name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/jobs/JOB_ID`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
