    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A job&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff_duration, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff_duration up to retry_count times. For example, if min_backoff_duration is 10s, max_backoff_duration is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a job will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the job will retry at intervals of max_backoff_duration until the job has been attempted retry_count times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... The default value of this field is 5.

    &quot;retryCount&quot;: 42, # The number of attempts that the system will make to run a job using the exponential backoff procedure described by max_doublings. The default value of retry_count is zero. If retry_count is zero, a job attempt will *not* be retried if it fails. Instead the Cloud Scheduler system will wait for the next scheduled execution time. If retry_count is set to a non-zero number then Cloud Scheduler will retry failed attempts, using exponential backoff, retry_count times, or until the next scheduled execution time, whichever comes first. Values greater than 5 and negative values are not allowed.

The schedule can be either of the following types: * [Crontab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) * English-like [schedule](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules) As a general rule, execution `n + 1` of a job will not begin until execution `n` has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the `n+1`th execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until 16:15, the `n+1`th execution will not start until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs. If retry_count &gt; 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a total of retry_count times, with exponential backoff, until the next scheduled start time.
  &quot;scheduleTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The next time the job is scheduled. Note that this may be a retry of a previously failed attempt or the next execution time according to the schedule.

  &quot;timeZone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting schedule. The value of this field must be a time zone name from the [tz database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database). Note that some time zones include a provision for daylight savings time. The rules for daylight saving time are determined by the chosen tz. For UTC use the string &quot;utc&quot;. If a time zone is not specified, the default will be in UTC (also known as GMT).

For example, if min_backoff_duration is 10s, max_backoff_duration is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a job will first be retried in 10s.

Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the `n+1`th execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until 16:15, the `n+1`th execution will not start until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs.

For example, if min_backoff_duration is 10s, max_backoff_duration is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a job will first be retried in 10s.

Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the `n+1`th execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until 16:15, the `n+1`th execution will not start until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs.

For example, if min_backoff_duration is 10s, max_backoff_duration is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a job will first be retried in 10s.

Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the `n+1`th execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until 16:15, the `n+1`th execution will not start until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs.

Some examples of valid values for uri are: `http://acme.com` and `https://acme.com/sales:8080`. Cloud Scheduler will encode some characters for safety and compatibility. The maximum allowed URL length is 2083 characters after encoding.
  },
  &quot;lastAttemptTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the last job attempt started.
  &quot;legacyAppEngineCron&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. This field is used to manage the legacy App Engine Cron jobs using the Cloud Scheduler API. If the field is set to true, the job will be considered a legacy job. Note that App Engine Cron jobs have fewer features than Cloud Scheduler jobs, e.g., are only limited to App Engine targets.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optionally caller-specified in CreateJob, after which it becomes output only. The job name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/jobs/JOB_ID`. * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the job&#x27;s location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `JOB_ID` can contain only letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 500 characters.

    &quot;topicName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic to which messages will be published when a job is delivered. The topic name must be in the same format as required by PubSub&#x27;s [PublishRequest.name](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rpc/google.pubsub.v1#publishrequest), for example `projects/PROJECT_ID/topics/TOPIC_ID`. The topic must be in the same project as the Cloud Scheduler job.
  },
  &quot;retryConfig&quot;: { # Settings that determine the retry behavior. By default, if a job does not complete successfully (meaning that an acknowledgement is not received from the handler, then it will be retried with exponential backoff according to the settings in RetryConfig. # Settings that determine the retry behavior.
    &quot;maxBackoffDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails. The default value of this field is 1 hour.
    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A job&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff_duration, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff_duration up to retry_count times. For example, if min_backoff_duration is 10s, max_backoff_duration is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a job will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the job will retry at intervals of max_backoff_duration until the job has been attempted retry_count times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... The default value of this field is 5.
    &quot;maxRetryDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time limit for retrying a failed job, measured from time when an execution was first attempted. If specified with retry_count, the job will be retried until both limits are reached. The default value for max_retry_duration is zero, which means retry duration is unlimited.
    &quot;minBackoffDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails. The default value of this field is 5 seconds.
    &quot;retryCount&quot;: 42, # The number of attempts that the system will make to run a job using the exponential backoff procedure described by max_doublings. The default value of retry_count is zero. If retry_count is zero, a job attempt will *not* be retried if it fails. Instead the Cloud Scheduler system will wait for the next scheduled execution time. If retry_count is set to a non-zero number then Cloud Scheduler will retry failed attempts, using exponential backoff, retry_count times, or until the next scheduled execution time, whichever comes first. Values greater than 5 and negative values are not allowed.
  },
  &quot;schedule&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required, except when used with UpdateJob. Describes the schedule on which the job will be executed. The schedule can be either of the following types: * [Crontab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) * English-like [schedule](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules) As a general rule, execution `n + 1` of a job will not begin until execution `n` has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the `n+1`th execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until 16:15, the `n+1`th execution will not start until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs. If retry_count &gt; 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a total of retry_count times, with exponential backoff, until the next scheduled start time.
  &quot;scheduleTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The next time the job is scheduled. Note that this may be a retry of a previously failed attempt or the next execution time according to the schedule.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the job.
  &quot;status&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Output only. The response from the target for the last attempted execution.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;timeZone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting schedule. The value of this field must be a time zone name from the [tz database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database). Note that some time zones include a provision for daylight savings time. The rules for daylight saving time are determined by the chosen tz. For UTC use the string &quot;utc&quot;. If a time zone is not specified, the default will be in UTC (also known as GMT).
  &quot;userUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The creation time of the job.
