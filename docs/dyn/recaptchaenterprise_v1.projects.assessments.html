<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="annotate">annotate(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Annotates a previously created Assessment to provide additional information on whether the event turned out to be authentic or fraudulent.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the Assessment, in the format &quot;projects/{project}/assessments/{assessment}&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message to annotate an Assessment.
  &quot;annotation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The annotation that will be assigned to the Event. This field can be left empty to provide reasons that apply to an event without concluding whether the event is legitimate or fraudulent.
  &quot;hashedAccountId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Unique stable hashed user identifier to apply to the assessment. This is an alternative to setting the hashed_account_id in CreateAssessment, for example when the account identifier is not yet known in the initial request. It is recommended that the identifier is hashed using hmac-sha256 with stable secret.
  &quot;reasons&quot;: [ # Optional. Optional reasons for the annotation that will be assigned to the Event.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;transactionEvent&quot;: { # Describes an event in the lifecycle of a payment transaction. # Optional. If the Assessment is part of a Payment Transaction, provide details on Payment Lifecycle Events that occur in the Transaction.
    &quot;eventTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Timestamp when this transaction event occurred; otherwise assumed to be the time of the API call.
    &quot;eventType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The type of this transaction event.
    &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The reason or standardized code which corresponds with this transaction event, if one exists. E.g. a CHARGEBACK Event with code 4553.
    &quot;value&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. The value that corresponds with this transaction event, if one exists. E.g. A refund event where $5.00 was refunded. Currency is obtained from the original transaction data.
  },
}
