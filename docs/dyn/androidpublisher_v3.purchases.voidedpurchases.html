<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(packageName, endTime=None, maxResults=None, startIndex=None, startTime=None, token=None, type=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the purchases that were canceled, refunded or charged-back.

Args:
  packageName: string, The package name of the application for which voided purchases need to be returned (for example, &#x27;com.some.thing&#x27;). (required)
  endTime: string, The time, in milliseconds since the Epoch, of the newest voided purchase that you want to see in the response. The value of this parameter cannot be greater than the current time and is ignored if a pagination token is set. Default value is current time. Note: This filter is applied on the time at which the record is seen as voided by our systems and not the actual voided time returned in the response.
  maxResults: integer, A parameter
  startIndex: integer, A parameter
  startTime: string, The time, in milliseconds since the Epoch, of the oldest voided purchase that you want to see in the response. The value of this parameter cannot be older than 30 days and is ignored if a pagination token is set. Default value is current time minus 30 days. Note: This filter is applied on the time at which the record is seen as voided by our systems and not the actual voided time returned in the response.
  token: string, A parameter
  type: integer, The type of voided purchases that you want to see in the response. Possible values are:  
- 0: Only voided in-app product purchases will be returned in the response. This is the default value.
- 1: Both voided in-app purchases and voided subscription purchases will be returned in the response.  Note: Before requesting to receive voided subscription purchases, you must switch to use orderId in the response which uniquely identifies one-time purchases and subscriptions. Otherwise, you will receive multiple subscription orders with the same PurchaseToken, because subscription renewal orders share the same PurchaseToken.

Returns:
  An object of the form:
