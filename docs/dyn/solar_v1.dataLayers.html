  <pre>Gets solar information for a region surrounding a location. Returns an error with code `NOT_FOUND` if the location is outside the coverage area.

Args:
  exactQualityRequired: boolean, Optional. Whether to require exact quality of the imagery. If set to false, the `required_quality` field is interpreted as the minimum required quality, such that HIGH quality imagery may be returned when `required_quality` is set to MEDIUM. If set to true, `required_quality` is interpreted as the exact required quality and only `MEDIUM` quality imagery is returned if `required_quality` is set to `MEDIUM`.
  experiments: string, Optional. Specifies the pre-GA experiments to enable. (repeated)
    Allowed values
      EXPERIMENT_UNSPECIFIED - No experiments are specified.
      EXPANDED_COVERAGE - Expands the geographic region available for querying solar data.
  location_latitude: number, The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].
  location_longitude: number, The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].
  pixelSizeMeters: number, Optional. The minimum scale, in meters per pixel, of the data to return. Values of 0.1 (the default, if this field is not set explicitly), 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 are supported. Imagery components whose normal resolution is less than `pixel_size_meters` will be returned at the resolution specified by `pixel_size_meters`; imagery components whose normal resolution is equal to or greater than `pixel_size_meters` will be returned at that normal resolution.
  radiusMeters: number, Required. The radius, in meters, defining the region surrounding that centre point for which data should be returned. The limitations on this value are: * Any value up to 100m can always be specified. * Values over 100m can be specified, as long as `radius_meters` &lt;= `pixel_size_meters * 1000`. * However, for values over 175m, the `DataLayerView` in the request must not include monthly flux or hourly shade.
  requiredQuality: string, Optional. The minimum quality level allowed in the results. No result with lower quality than this will be returned. Not specifying this is equivalent to restricting to HIGH quality only.
    Allowed values
      IMAGERY_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED - No quality is known.
      HIGH - Solar data is derived from aerial imagery captured at low-altitude and processed at 0.1 m/pixel.
      MEDIUM - Solar data is derived from enhanced aerial imagery captured at high-altitude and processed at 0.25 m/pixel.
      LOW - Solar data is derived from enhanced satellite imagery processed at 0.25 m/pixel.
      BASE - Solar data is derived from enhanced satellite imagery processed at 0.25 m/pixel.
  view: string, Optional. The desired subset of the data to return.
    Allowed values
      DATA_LAYER_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - Equivalent to FULL.
      DSM_LAYER - Get the DSM only.
      IMAGERY_LAYERS - Get the DSM, RGB, and mask.
      IMAGERY_AND_ANNUAL_FLUX_LAYERS - Get the DSM, RGB, mask, and annual flux.
      IMAGERY_AND_ALL_FLUX_LAYERS - Get the DSM, RGB, mask, annual flux, and monthly flux.
      FULL_LAYERS - Get all data.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Information about the solar potential of a region. The actual data are contained in a number of GeoTIFF files covering the requested region, for which this message contains URLs: Each string in the `DataLayers` message contains a URL from which the corresponding GeoTIFF can be fetched. These URLs are valid for a few hours after they&#x27;ve been generated. Most of the GeoTIFF files are at a resolution of 0.1m/pixel, but the monthly flux file is at 0.5m/pixel, and the hourly shade files are at 1m/pixel. If a `pixel_size_meters` value was specified in the `GetDataLayersRequest`, then the minimum resolution in the GeoTIFF files will be that value.
  &quot;annualFluxUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL for the annual flux map (annual sunlight on roofs) of the region. Values are kWh/kW/year. This is *unmasked flux*: flux is computed for every location, not just building rooftops. Invalid locations are stored as -9999: locations outside our coverage area will be invalid, and a few locations inside the coverage area, where we were unable to calculate flux, will also be invalid.
  &quot;dsmUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL for an image of the DSM (Digital Surface Model) of the region. Values are in meters above EGM96 geoid (i.e., sea level). Invalid locations (where we don&#x27;t have data) are stored as -9999.
  &quot;hourlyShadeUrls&quot;: [ # Twelve URLs for hourly shade, corresponding to January...December, in order. Each GeoTIFF will contain 24 bands, corresponding to the 24 hours of the day. Each pixel is a 32 bit integer, corresponding to the (up to) 31 days of that month; a 1 bit means that the corresponding location is able to see the sun at that day, of that hour, of that month. Invalid locations are stored as -9999 (since this is negative, it has bit 31 set, and no valid value could have bit 31 set as that would correspond to the 32nd day of the month). An example may be useful. If you want to know whether a point (at pixel location (x, y)) saw sun at 4pm on the 22nd of June you would: 1. fetch the sixth URL in this list (corresponding to June). 1. look up the 17th channel (corresponding to 4pm). 1. read the 32-bit value at (x, y). 1. read bit 21 of the value (corresponding to the 22nd of the month). 1. if that bit is a 1, then that spot saw the sun at 4pm 22 June. More formally: Given `month` (1-12), `day` (1...month max; February has 28 days) and `hour` (0-23), the shade/sun for that month/day/hour at a position `(x, y)` is the bit ``` (hourly_shade[month - 1])(x, y)[hour] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (day - 1)) ``` where `(x, y)` is spatial indexing, `[month - 1]` refers to fetching the `month - 1`st URL (indexing from zero), `[hour]` is indexing into the channels, and a final non-zero result means &quot;sunny&quot;. There are no leap days, and DST doesn&#x27;t exist (all days are 24 hours long; noon is always &quot;standard time&quot; noon).
