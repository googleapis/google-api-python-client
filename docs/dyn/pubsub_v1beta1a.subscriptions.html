<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="acknowledge">acknowledge(body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Acknowledges a particular received message: the Pub/Sub system can remove
the given message from the subscription. Acknowledging a message whose
Ack deadline has expired may succeed, but the message could have been
already redelivered. Acknowledging a message more than once will not
result in an error. This is only used for messages received via pull.

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the Acknowledge method.
    "ackId": [ # The acknowledgment ID for the message being acknowledged. This was
        # returned by the Pub/Sub system in the Pull response.
      "A String",
    ],
    "subscription": "A String", # The subscription whose message is being acknowledged.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty
      # messages in your project. A typical example is to use it as argument or the
      # return value of a service API. For instance:
      #
      #   service Foo {
      #     rpc Bar (proto2.Empty) returns (proto2.Empty) { };
      #   };
      #
      # BEGIN GOOGLE-INTERNAL
      # The difference between this one and net/rpc/empty-message.proto is that
      # 1) The generated message here is in proto2 C++ API.
      # 2) The proto2.Empty has minimum dependencies
      #    (no message_set or net/rpc dependencies)

<div class="method">

  <pre>Creates a subscription on a given topic for a given subscriber.
If the subscription already exists, returns ALREADY_EXISTS.
If the corresponding topic doesn't exist, returns NOT_FOUND.

If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random
name for this subscription on the same project as the topic.

        # Ack or a Nack, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.
        # If a subscriber acknowledges after the deadline, the Pub/Sub system may
        # accept the Ack, but it is possible that the message has been already
        # delivered again. Multiple Acks to the message are allowed and will
        # succeed.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</code>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="pullBatch">pullBatch(body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Pulls messages from the server. Returns an empty list if there are no
messages available in the backlog. The system is free to return UNAVAILABLE
if there are too many pull requests outstanding for the given subscription.

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the PullBatch method.
    "maxEvents": 42, # The maximum number of PubsubEvents returned for this request. The Pub/Sub
        # system may return fewer than the number of events specified.
    "returnImmediately": True or False, # If this is specified as true the system will respond immediately even if
        # it is not able to return a message in the Pull response. Otherwise the
        # system is allowed to wait until at least one message is available rather
        # than returning no messages. The client may cancel the request if it does
        # not wish to wait any longer for the response.
    "subscription": "A String", # The subscription from which messages should be pulled.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response for the PullBatch method.
    "pullResponses": [ # Received Pub/Sub messages or status events. The Pub/Sub system will return
        # zero messages if there are no more messages available in the backlog. The
        # Pub/Sub system may return fewer than the max_events requested even if
        # there are more messages available in the backlog.

          # must be populated.
        "pubsubEvent": { # An event indicating a received message or truncation event. # A pubsub message or truncation event.
          "deleted": True or False, # Indicates that this subscription has been deleted. (Note that pull
              # subscribers will always receive NOT_FOUND in response in their pull
              # request on the subscription, rather than seeing this boolean.)

                    # "host" portion is called the "namespace" and is not necessarily
                    # resolvable to a network endpoint.  Instead, the namespace indicates what
                    # system or entity defines the semantics of the label.  Namespaces do not
                    # restrict the set of objects to which a label may be associated.
