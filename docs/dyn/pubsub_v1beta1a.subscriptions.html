<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#acknowledge">acknowledge(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Acknowledges a particular received message: the Pub/Sub system can remove the given message from the subscription. Acknowledging a message whose Ack deadline has expired may succeed, but the message could have been already redelivered. Acknowledging a message more than once will not result in an error.

<p class="firstline">Creates a subscription on a given topic for a given subscriber. If the subscription already exists, returns ALREADY_EXISTS. If the corresponding topic doesn't exist, returns NOT_FOUND. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this subscription on the same project as the topic.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#delete">delete(subscription, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>

<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="acknowledge">acknowledge(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Acknowledges a particular received message: the Pub/Sub system can remove the given message from the subscription. Acknowledging a message whose Ack deadline has expired may succeed, but the message could have been already redelivered. Acknowledging a message more than once will not result in an error. This is only used for messages received via pull.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the Acknowledge method.
  &quot;ackId&quot;: [ # The acknowledgment ID for the message being acknowledged. This was returned by the Pub/Sub system in the Pull response.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;subscription&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The subscription whose message is being acknowledged.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your project. A typical example is to use it as argument or the return value of a service API. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar (proto2.Empty) returns (proto2.Empty) { }; }; BEGIN GOOGLE-INTERNAL The difference between this one and net/rpc/empty-message.proto is that 1) The generated message here is in proto2 C++ API. 2) The proto2.Empty has minimum dependencies (no message_set or net/rpc dependencies) END GOOGLE-INTERNAL

  <pre>Close httplib2 connections.</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">

  <pre>Creates a subscription on a given topic for a given subscriber. If the subscription already exists, returns ALREADY_EXISTS. If the corresponding topic doesn&#x27;t exist, returns NOT_FOUND. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this subscription on the same project as the topic.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A subscription resource.
  &quot;ackDeadlineSeconds&quot;: 42, # For either push or pull delivery, the value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message before the subscriber should acknowledge or Nack the message. If the Ack deadline for a message passes without an Ack or a Nack, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message. If a subscriber acknowledges after the deadline, the Pub/Sub system may accept the Ack, but it is possible that the message has been already delivered again. Multiple Acks to the message are allowed and will succeed. For push delivery, this value is used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. For pull delivery, this value is used as the initial value for the Ack deadline. It may be overridden for each message using its corresponding ack_id with ModifyAckDeadline. While a message is outstanding (i.e. it has been delivered to a pull subscriber and the subscriber has not yet Acked or Nacked), the Pub/Sub system will not deliver that message to another pull subscriber (on a best-effort basis).
