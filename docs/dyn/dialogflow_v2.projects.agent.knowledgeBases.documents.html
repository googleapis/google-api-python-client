  <pre>Creates a new document. Operation 

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The knowledge base to create a document for. Format: `projects//locations//knowledgeBases/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A knowledge document to be used by a KnowledgeBase. For more information, see the [knowledge base guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/how/knowledge-bases). Note: The `projects.agent.knowledgeBases.documents` resource is deprecated; only use `projects.knowledgeBases.documents`.
  &quot;contentUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URI where the file content is located. For documents stored in Google Cloud Storage, these URIs must have the form `gs:///`. NOTE: External URLs must correspond to public webpages, i.e., they must be indexed by Google Search. In particular, URLs for showing documents in Google Cloud Storage (i.e. the URL in your browser) are not supported. Instead use the `gs://` format URI described above.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The display name of the document. The name must be 1024 bytes or less; otherwise, the creation request fails.
  &quot;enableAutoReload&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, we try to automatically reload the document every day (at a time picked by the system). If false or unspecified, we don&#x27;t try to automatically reload the document. Currently you can only enable automatic reload for documents sourced from a public url, see `source` field for the source types. Reload status can be tracked in `latest_reload_status`. If a reload fails, we will keep the document unchanged. If a reload fails with internal errors, the system will try to reload the document on the next day. If a reload fails with non-retriable errors (e.g. PERMISION_DENIED), the system will not try to reload the document anymore. You need to manually reload the document successfully by calling `ReloadDocument` and clear the errors.

  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Optional. Metadata for the document. The metadata supports arbitrary key-value pairs. Suggested use cases include storing a document&#x27;s title, an external URL distinct from the document&#x27;s content_uri, etc. The max size of a `key` or a `value` of the metadata is 1024 bytes.

  updateMask: string, Optional. Not specified means `update all`. Currently, only `display_name` can be updated, an InvalidArgument will be returned for attempting to update other fields.

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="reload">reload(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Reloads the specified document from its specified source, content_uri or content. The previously loaded content of the document will be deleted. Note: Even when the content of the document has not changed, there still may be side effects because of internal implementation changes. Note: The `projects.agent.knowledgeBases.documents` resource is deprecated; only use `projects.knowledgeBases.documents`. Operation 

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the document to reload. Format: `projects//locations//knowledgeBases//documents/` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for Documents.ReloadDocument.
  &quot;contentUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The path of gcs source file for reloading document content. For now, only gcs uri is supported. For documents stored in Google Cloud Storage, these URIs must have the form `gs:///`.
