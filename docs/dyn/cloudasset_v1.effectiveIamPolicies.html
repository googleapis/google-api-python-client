  <pre>Gets effective IAM policies for a batch of resources.

Args:
  scope: string, Required. Only IAM policies on or below the scope will be returned. This can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;). To know how to get organization id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id). To know how to get folder or project id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders#viewing_or_listing_folders_and_projects). (required)
  names: string, Required. The names refer to the [full_resource_names] (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) of [searchable asset types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#searchable_asset_types). A maximum of 20 resources&#x27; effective policies can be retrieved in a batch. (repeated)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A response message for AssetService.BatchGetEffectiveIamPolicies.
  &quot;policyResults&quot;: [ # The effective policies for a batch of resources. Note that the results order is the same as the order of BatchGetEffectiveIamPoliciesRequest.names. When a resource does not have any effective IAM policies, its corresponding policy_result will contain empty EffectiveIamPolicy.policies.
    { # The effective IAM policies on one resource.
      &quot;fullResourceName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [full_resource_name] (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) for which the policies are computed. This is one of the BatchGetEffectiveIamPoliciesRequest.names the caller provides in the request.
      &quot;policies&quot;: [ # The effective policies for the full_resource_name. These policies include the policy set on the full_resource_name and those set on its parents and ancestors up to the BatchGetEffectiveIamPoliciesRequest.scope. Note that these policies are not filtered according to the resource type of the full_resource_name. These policies are hierarchically ordered by PolicyInfo.attached_resource starting from full_resource_name itself to its parents and ancestors, such that policies[i]&#x27;s PolicyInfo.attached_resource is the child of policies[i+1]&#x27;s PolicyInfo.attached_resource, if policies[i+1] exists.
        { # The IAM policy and its attached resource.
          &quot;attachedResource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full resource name the policy is directly attached to.
          &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # The IAM policy that&#x27;s directly attached to the attached_resource.

              { # Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs: { &quot;audit_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;allServices&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:jose@example.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;ADMIN_READ&quot; } ] }, { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;sampleservice.googleapis.com&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:aliya@example.com&quot; ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.
                &quot;auditLogConfigs&quot;: [ # The configuration for logging of each type of permission.

                    &quot;exemptedMembers&quot;: [ # Specifies the identities that do not cause logging for this type of permission. Follows the same format of Binding.members.

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts).

For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted.

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.
