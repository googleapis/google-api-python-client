Args:
  parent: string, Required. The agent to create a entity type for. Format: `projects//locations//agents/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Entities are extracted from user input and represent parameters that are meaningful to your application. For example, a date range, a proper name such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent actionable data for your application. When you define an entity, you can also include synonyms that all map to that entity. For example, &quot;soft drink&quot;, &quot;soda&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;, and so on. There are three types of entities: * **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is represented by the `EntityType` type. * **Custom** - entities that are defined by you that represent actionable data that is meaningful to your application. For example, you could define a `pizza.sauce` entity for red or white pizza sauce, a `pizza.cheese` entity for the different types of cheese on a pizza, a `pizza.topping` entity for different toppings, and so on. A custom entity is represented by the `EntityType` type. * **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such as favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is represented by the SessionEntityType type. For more information about entity types, see the [Dialogflow documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).
  &quot;autoExpansionMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Indicates whether the entity type can be automatically expanded.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human-readable name of the entity type, unique within the agent.
  &quot;enableFuzzyExtraction&quot;: True or False, # Enables fuzzy entity extraction during classification.
  &quot;entities&quot;: [ # The collection of entity entries associated with the entity type.
    { # An **entity entry** for an associated entity type.
      &quot;synonyms&quot;: [ # Required. A collection of value synonyms. For example, if the entity type is *vegetable*, and `value` is *scallions*, a synonym could be *green onions*. For `KIND_LIST` entity types: * This collection must contain exactly one synonym equal to `value`.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The primary value associated with this entity entry. For example, if the entity type is *vegetable*, the value could be *scallions*. For `KIND_MAP` entity types: * A canonical value to be used in place of synonyms. For `KIND_LIST` entity types: * A string that can contain references to other entity types (with or without aliases).
    },
  ],
  &quot;excludedPhrases&quot;: [ # Collection of exceptional words and phrases that shouldn&#x27;t be matched. For example, if you have a size entity type with entry `giant`(an adjective), you might consider adding `giants`(a noun) as an exclusion. If the kind of entity type is `KIND_MAP`, then the phrases specified by entities and excluded phrases should be mutually exclusive.
    { # An excluded entity phrase that should not be matched.
      &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The word or phrase to be excluded.
    },
  ],
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Indicates the kind of entity type.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique identifier of the entity type. Required for EntityTypes.UpdateEntityType. Format: `projects//locations//agents//entityTypes/`.

}

  languageCode: string, The language of the following fields in `entity_type`: * `EntityType.entities.value` * `EntityType.entities.synonyms` * `EntityType.excluded_phrases.value` If not specified, the agent&#x27;s default language is used. [Many languages](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/language) are supported. Note: languages must be enabled in the agent before they can be used.

  <pre>Deletes the specified entity type. Note: You should always train a flow prior to sending it queries. See the [training documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/training).

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the entity type to delete. Format: `projects//locations//agents//entityTypes/`. (required)
  force: boolean, This field has no effect for entity type not being used. For entity types that are used by intents or pages: * If `force` is set to false, an error will be returned with message indicating the referencing resources. * If `force` is set to true, Dialogflow will remove the entity type, as well as any references to the entity type (i.e. Page parameter of the entity type will be changed to &#x27;@sys.any&#x27; and intent parameter of the entity type will be removed).

Returns:

    { # Entities are extracted from user input and represent parameters that are meaningful to your application. For example, a date range, a proper name such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent actionable data for your application. When you define an entity, you can also include synonyms that all map to that entity. For example, &quot;soft drink&quot;, &quot;soda&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;, and so on. There are three types of entities: * **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is represented by the `EntityType` type. * **Custom** - entities that are defined by you that represent actionable data that is meaningful to your application. For example, you could define a `pizza.sauce` entity for red or white pizza sauce, a `pizza.cheese` entity for the different types of cheese on a pizza, a `pizza.topping` entity for different toppings, and so on. A custom entity is represented by the `EntityType` type. * **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such as favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is represented by the SessionEntityType type. For more information about entity types, see the [Dialogflow documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).
