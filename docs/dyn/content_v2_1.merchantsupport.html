A section of the text in such a paragraph will have a class `tooltip-text` and is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. If the style is not used, the `tooltip-text` section would be shown on a new line, after the main part of the text. * `tooltip-text` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. * `tooltip-icon` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that can be replaced with a tooltip icon, for example &#x27;?&#x27; or &#x27;i&#x27;. By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the &#x27;?&#x27; as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the &#x27;i&#x27; as an icon. * `content-moderation` - marks the paragraph that explains how the issue was identified. * `new-element` - Present for new elements added to the pre-rendered content in the future. To make sure that a new content element does not break your style, you can hide everything with this class.

A section of the text in such a paragraph will have a class `tooltip-text` and is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. If the style is not used, the `tooltip-text` section would be shown on a new line, after the main part of the text. * `tooltip-text` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. * `tooltip-icon` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that can be replaced with a tooltip icon, for example &#x27;?&#x27; or &#x27;i&#x27;. By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the &#x27;?&#x27; as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the &#x27;i&#x27; as an icon. * `content-moderation` - marks the paragraph that explains how the issue was identified. * `list-intro` - marks the paragraph that contains an intro for a list. This paragraph will be always followed by a list. * `new-element` - Present for new elements added to the pre-rendered content in the future. To make sure that a new content element does not break your style, you can hide everything with this class.
