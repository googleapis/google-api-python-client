For example, you can use [DOMPurify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify). CSS classes: * `issue-detail` - top level container for the detail of the issue * `callout-banners` - section of the `issue-detail` with callout banners * `callout-banner` - single callout banner, inside `callout-banners` * `callout-banner-info` - callout with important information (default) * `callout-banner-warning` - callout with a warning * `callout-banner-error` - callout informing about an error (most severe) * `issue-content` - section of the `issue-detail`, contains multiple `content-element` * `content-element` - content element such as a list, link or paragraph, inside `issue-content` * `root-causes` - unordered list with items describing root causes of the issue, inside `issue-content` * `root-causes-intro` - intro text before the `root-causes` list, inside `issue-content` * `segment` - section of the text, `span` inside paragraph * `segment-attribute` - section of the text that represents a product attribute, for example &#x27;image\_link&#x27; * `segment-literal` - section of the text that contains a special value, for example &#x27;0-1000 kg&#x27; * `segment-bold` - section of the text that should be rendered as bold * `segment-italic` - section of the text that should be rendered as italic * `tooltip` - used on paragraphs that should be rendered with a tooltip. A section of the text in such a paragraph will have a class `tooltip-text` and is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. If the style is not used, the `tooltip-text` section would be shown on a new line, after the main part of the text. * `tooltip-text` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. * `tooltip-icon` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that can be replaced with a tooltip icon, for example &#x27;?&#x27; or &#x27;i&#x27;. By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the &#x27;?&#x27; as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the &#x27;i&#x27; as an icon. * `content-moderation` - marks the paragraph that explains how the issue was identified. * `new-element` - Present for new elements added to the pre-rendered content in the future. To make sure that a new content element does not break your style, you can hide everything with this class.

HTML elements contain CSS classes that can be used to customize the style of this snippet. Always sanitize the HTML before embedding it directly to your application. The sanitizer needs to allow basic HTML tags, such as: `div`, `span`, `p`, `a`, `ul`, `li`, `table`, `tr`, `td`. For example, you can use [DOMPurify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify). CSS classes: * `ods-section`* - wrapper around the out-of-court dispute resolution section * `ods-description`* - intro text for the out-of-court dispute resolution. It may contain multiple segments and a link. * `ods-param`* - wrapper around the header-value pair for parameters that merchant may need to provide during the ODS process. * `ods-routing-id`* - ods param for the Routing ID. * `ods-reference-id`* - ods param for the Routing ID. * `ods-param-header`* - header for the ODS parameter * `ods-param-value`* - value of the ODS parameter. This value should be rendered in a way that it is easy for merchants to identify and copy. * `segment` - section of the text, `span` inside paragraph * `segment-attribute` - section of the text that represents a product attribute, for example &#x27;image\_link&#x27; * `segment-literal` - section of the text that contains a special value, for example &#x27;0-1000 kg&#x27; * `segment-bold` - section of the text that should be rendered as bold * `segment-italic` - section of the text that should be rendered as italic * `tooltip` - used on paragraphs that should be rendered with a tooltip. A section of the text in such a paragraph will have a class `tooltip-text` and is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. If the style is not used, the `tooltip-text` section would be shown on a new line, after the main part of the text. * `tooltip-text` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. * `tooltip-icon` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that can be replaced with a tooltip icon, for example &#x27;?&#x27; or &#x27;i&#x27;. By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the &#x27;?&#x27; as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the &#x27;i&#x27; as an icon.

CSS classes: * `ods-section`* - wrapper around the out-of-court dispute resolution section * `ods-description`* - intro text for the out-of-court dispute resolution. It may contain multiple segments and a link. * `ods-param`* - wrapper around the header-value pair for parameters that merchant may need to provide during the ODS process. * `ods-routing-id`* - ods param for the Routing ID. * `ods-reference-id`* - ods param for the Routing ID. * `ods-param-header`* - header for the ODS parameter * `ods-param-value`* - value of the ODS parameter. This value should be rendered in a way that it is easy for merchants to identify and copy. * `segment` - section of the text, `span` inside paragraph * `segment-attribute` - section of the text that represents a product attribute, for example &#x27;image\_link&#x27; * `segment-literal` - section of the text that contains a special value, for example &#x27;0-1000 kg&#x27; * `segment-bold` - section of the text that should be rendered as bold * `segment-italic` - section of the text that should be rendered as italic * `tooltip` - used on paragraphs that should be rendered with a tooltip. A section of the text in such a paragraph will have a class `tooltip-text` and is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. If the style is not used, the `tooltip-text` section would be shown on a new line, after the main part of the text. * `tooltip-text` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that is intended to be shown in a mouse over dialog. * `tooltip-icon` - marks a section of the text within a `tooltip`, that can be replaced with a tooltip icon, for example &#x27;?&#x27; or &#x27;i&#x27;. By default, this section contains a `br` tag, that is separating the main text and the tooltip text when the style is not used. * `tooltip-style-question` - the tooltip shows helpful information, can use the &#x27;?&#x27; as an icon. * `tooltip-style-info` - the tooltip adds additional information fitting to the context, can use the &#x27;i&#x27; as an icon.
