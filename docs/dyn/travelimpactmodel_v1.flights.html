Details on how emission estimates are computed: https://github.com/google/travel-impact-model The response will contain all entries that match the input flight legs, in the same order. If there are no estimates available for a certain flight leg, the response will return the flight leg object with empty emission fields. The request will still be considered successful. Reasons for missing emission estimates include: - The flight is unknown to the server. - The input flight leg is missing one or more identifiers. - The flight date is in the past. - The aircraft type is not supported by the model. - Missing seat configuration. The request can contain up to 1000 flight legs. If the request has more than 1000 direct flights, if will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.</p>

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input definition for the ComputeFlightEmissions request.
  &quot;flights&quot;: [ # Required. Direct flights to return emission estimates for.
    { # All details related to a single request item for a direct flight emission estimates.
      &quot;departureDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, such as a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are insignificant. The date is relative to the Gregorian Calendar. This can represent one of the following: * A full date, with non-zero year, month, and day values. * A month and day, with a zero year (for example, an anniversary). * A year on its own, with a zero month and a zero day. * A year and month, with a zero day (for example, a credit card expiration date). Related types: * google.type.TimeOfDay * google.type.DateTime * google.protobuf.Timestamp # Required. Date of the flight in the time zone of the origin airport. Must be a date in the present or future.
        &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn&#x27;t significant.
        &quot;month&quot;: 42, # Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day.
        &quot;year&quot;: 42, # Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without a year.
      },
      &quot;destination&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. IATA airport code for flight destination, e.g. &quot;JFK&quot;.
      &quot;flightNumber&quot;: 42, # Required. Flight number, e.g. 324.
      &quot;operatingCarrierCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. IATA carrier code, e.g. &quot;AA&quot;.
      &quot;origin&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. IATA airport code for flight origin, e.g. &quot;LHR&quot;.
    },

}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

        &quot;business&quot;: 42, # Emissions for one passenger in business class in grams. This field is always computed and populated, regardless of whether the aircraft has business class seats or not.
