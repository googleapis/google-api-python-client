Args:
  name: string, Required. Full resource name of the format: {name=projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/eventStores/default_event_store/placements/*} The id of the recommendation engine placement. This id is used to identify the set of models that will be used to make the prediction. We currently support three placements with the following IDs by default: * `shopping_cart`: Predicts items frequently bought together with one or more catalog items in the same shopping session. Commonly displayed after `add-to-cart` events, on product detail pages, or on the shopping cart page. * `home_page`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely engage with or purchase based on the shopping or viewing history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId`. For example - Recommendations for you. * `product_detail`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely engage with or purchase. The prediction is based on the shopping or viewing history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId` and its relevance to a specified `CatalogItem`. Typically used on product detail pages. For example - More items like this. * `recently_viewed_default`: Returns up to 75 items recently viewed by the specified `userId` or `visitorId`, most recent ones first. Returns nothing if neither of them has viewed any items yet. For example - Recently viewed. The full list of available placements can be seen at https://console.cloud.google.com/recommendation/datafeeds/default_catalog/dashboard (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for Predict method.
  &quot;dryRun&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Use dryRun mode for this prediction query. If set to true, a dummy model will be used that returns arbitrary catalog items. Note that the dryRun mode should only be used for testing the API, or if the model is not ready.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Filter for restricting prediction results. Accepts values for tags and the `filterOutOfStockItems` flag. * Tag expressions. Restricts predictions to items that match all of the specified tags. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the expression is enclosed in parentheses, and must be separated from the tag values by a space. `-&quot;tagA&quot;` is also supported and is equivalent to `NOT &quot;tagA&quot;`. Tag values must be double quoted UTF-8 encoded strings with a size limit of 1 KiB. * filterOutOfStockItems. Restricts predictions to items that do not have a stockState value of OUT_OF_STOCK. Examples: * tag=(&quot;Red&quot; OR &quot;Blue&quot;) tag=&quot;New-Arrival&quot; tag=(NOT &quot;promotional&quot;) * filterOutOfStockItems tag=(-&quot;promotional&quot;) * filterOutOfStockItems If your filter blocks all prediction results, nothing will be returned. If you want generic (unfiltered) popular items to be returned instead, set `strictFiltering` to false in `PredictRequest.params`.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. The labels for the predict request. * Label keys can contain lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, must start with a letter, and must end with a letter or digit. * Non-zero label values can contain lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, must start with a letter, and must end with a letter or digit. * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given request. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # Optional. Maximum number of results to return per page. Set this property to the number of prediction results required. If zero, the service will choose a reasonable default.
  &quot;pageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The previous PredictResponse.next_page_token.
  &quot;params&quot;: { # Optional. Additional domain specific parameters for the predictions. Allowed values: * `returnCatalogItem`: Boolean. If set to true, the associated catalogItem object will be returned in the `PredictResponse.PredictionResult.itemMetadata` object in the method response. * `returnItemScore`: Boolean. If set to true, the prediction &#x27;score&#x27; corresponding to each returned item will be set in the `metadata` field in the prediction response. The given &#x27;score&#x27; indicates the probability of an item being clicked/purchased given the user&#x27;s context and history. * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to false, the service will return generic (unfiltered) popular items instead of empty if your filter blocks all prediction results.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  },
  &quot;userEvent&quot;: { # UserEvent captures all metadata information recommendation engine needs to know about how end users interact with customers&#x27; website. # Required. Context about the user, what they are looking at and what action they took to trigger the predict request. Note that this user event detail won&#x27;t be ingested to userEvent logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write request is required for event logging.
    &quot;eventDetail&quot;: { # User event details shared by all recommendation types. # Optional. User event detailed information common across different recommendation types.
      &quot;eventAttributes&quot;: { # FeatureMap represents extra features that customers want to include in the recommendation model for catalogs/user events as categorical/numerical features. # Optional. Extra user event features to include in the recommendation model. For product recommendation, an example of extra user information is traffic_channel, i.e. how user arrives at the site. Users can arrive at the site by coming to the site directly, or coming through Google search, and etc.
        &quot;categoricalFeatures&quot;: { # Categorical features that can take on one of a limited number of possible values.

      ],
      &quot;pageViewId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A unique id of a web page view. This should be kept the same for all user events triggered from the same pageview. For example, an item detail page view could trigger multiple events as the user is browsing the page. The `pageViewId` property should be kept the same for all these events so that they can be grouped together properly. This `pageViewId` will be automatically generated if using the JavaScript pixel.
      &quot;recommendationToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Recommendation token included in the recommendation prediction response. This field enables accurate attribution of recommendation model performance. This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or purchase back to the event and the particular predict response containing this clicked/purchased item. If user clicks on product K in the recommendation results, pass the `PredictResponse.recommendationToken` property as a url parameter to product K&#x27;s page. When recording events on product K&#x27;s page, log the PredictResponse.recommendation_token to this field. Optional, but highly encouraged for user events that are the result of a recommendation prediction query.
      &quot;referrerUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The referrer url of the current page. When using the JavaScript pixel, this value is filled in automatically.
      &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Complete url (window.location.href) of the user&#x27;s current page. When using the JavaScript pixel, this value is filled in automatically. Maximum length 5KB.
