<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(serviceName, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new service configuration rollout. Based on rollout, the
Google Service Management will roll out the service configurations to
different backend services. For example, the logging configuration will be
pushed to Google Cloud Logging.

Please note that any previous pending and running Rollouts and associated
Operations will be automatically cancelled so that the latest Rollout will
not be blocked by previous Rollouts.

Only the 100 most recent (in any state) and the last 10 successful (if not
already part of the set of 100 most recent) rollouts are kept for each
service. The rest will be deleted eventually.
