<p class="firstline">Completes the [import process](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/import-data) for the specified space and makes it visible to users. Requires app authentication and domain-wide delegation. For more information, see [Authorize Google Chat apps to import data](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authorize-import).</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#create">create(body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Creates a named space. Spaces grouped by topics aren't supported. For an example, see [Create a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-spaces). If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS` when creating a space, try a different `displayName`. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name.

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#delete">delete(name, useAdminAccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Deletes a named space. Always performs a cascading delete, which means that the space's child resources—like messages posted in the space and memberships in the space—are also deleted. For an example, see [Delete a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/delete-spaces). Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) from a user who has permission to delete the space.</p>

For an example, see [Find a direct message](/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/find-direct-message). With [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user), returns the direct message space between the specified user and the authenticated user. With [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app), returns the direct message space between the specified user and the calling Chat app. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) or [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app).</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#get">get(name, useAdminAccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns details about a space. For an example, see [Get details about a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/get-spaces).

For an example, see [List spaces](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/list-spaces). Requires [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize). Supports [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) and [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user). Lists spaces visible to the caller or authenticated user. Group chats and DMs aren't listed until the first message is sent. To list all named spaces by Google Workspace organization, use the [`spaces.search()`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces/search) method using Workspace administrator privileges instead.</p>

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#setup">setup(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Creates a space and adds specified users to it. The calling user is automatically added to the space, and shouldn't be specified as a membership in the request. For an example, see [Set up a space with initial members](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/set-up-spaces). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `membership.member.name`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `id` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person profile ID for `user@example.com` is `123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. To specify the Google groups to add, add memberships with the appropriate `membership.group_member.name`. To add or invite a Google group, use `groups/{group}`, where `{group}` is the `id` for the group from the Cloud Identity Groups API. For example, you can use [Cloud Identity Groups lookup API](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups/lookup) to retrieve the ID `123456789` for group email `group@example.com`, then you can add the group to the space by setting the `membership.group_member.name` to `groups/123456789`. Group email is not supported, and Google groups can only be added as members in named spaces. For a named space or group chat, if the caller blocks, or is blocked by some members, or doesn't have permission to add some members, then those members aren't added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn't created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don't specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [Invite or add a user or app to a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-members). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies aren't supported. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS` when setting up a space, try a different `displayName`. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user).</p>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, useAdminAccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a named space. Always performs a cascading delete, which means that the space&#x27;s child resources—like messages posted in the space and memberships in the space—are also deleted. For an example, see [Delete a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/delete-spaces). Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) from a user who has permission to delete the space.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Resource name of the space to delete. Format: `spaces/{space}` (required)
  useAdminAccess: boolean, [Developer Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview). When `true`, the method runs using the user&#x27;s Google Workspace administrator privileges. The calling user must be a Google Workspace administrator with the [manage chat and spaces conversations privilege](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13369245). Requires the `chat.admin.delete` [OAuth 2.0 scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="findDirectMessage">findDirectMessage(name=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the existing direct message with the specified user. If no direct message space is found, returns a `404 NOT_FOUND` error. For an example, see [Find a direct message](/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/find-direct-message). With [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user), returns the direct message space between the specified user and the authenticated user. With [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app), returns the direct message space between the specified user and the calling Chat app. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) or [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app).

Args:
  name: string, Required. Resource name of the user to find direct message with. Format: `users/{user}`, where `{user}` is either the `id` for the [person](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people) from the People API, or the `id` for the [user](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users) in the Directory API. For example, if the People API profile ID is `123456789`, you can find a direct message with that person by using `users/123456789` as the `name`. When [authenticated as a user](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user), you can use the email as an alias for `{user}`. For example, `users/example@gmail.com` where `example@gmail.com` is the email of the Google Chat user.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists spaces the caller is a member of. Group chats and DMs aren&#x27;t listed until the first message is sent. For an example, see [List spaces](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/list-spaces). Requires [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize). Supports [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) and [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user). Lists spaces visible to the caller or authenticated user. Group chats and DMs aren&#x27;t listed until the first message is sent. To list all named spaces by Google Workspace organization, use the [`spaces.search()`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces/search) method using Workspace administrator privileges instead.

Args:
  filter: string, Optional. A query filter. You can filter spaces by the space type ([`space_type`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces#spacetype)). To filter by space type, you must specify valid enum value, such as `SPACE` or `GROUP_CHAT` (the `space_type` can&#x27;t be `SPACE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`). To query for multiple space types, use the `OR` operator. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` space_type = &quot;SPACE&quot; spaceType = &quot;GROUP_CHAT&quot; OR spaceType = &quot;DIRECT_MESSAGE&quot; ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of spaces to return. The service might return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 spaces are returned. The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value more than 1000, it&#x27;s automatically changed to 1000. Negative values return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous list spaces call. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, the filter value should match the call that provided the page token. Passing a different value may lead to unexpected results.

  updateMask: string, Required. The updated field paths, comma separated if there are multiple. You can update the following fields for a space: - `space_details` - `display_name`: Only supports updating the display name for spaces where `spaceType` field is `SPACE`. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS`, try a different value. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name. - `space_type`: Only supports changing a `GROUP_CHAT` space type to `SPACE`. Include `display_name` together with `space_type` in the update mask and ensure that the specified space has a non-empty display name and the `SPACE` space type. Including the `space_type` mask and the `SPACE` type in the specified space when updating the display name is optional if the existing space already has the `SPACE` type. Trying to update the space type in other ways results in an invalid argument error. `space_type` is not supported with admin access. - `space_history_state`: Updates [space history settings](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7664687) by turning history on or off for the space. Only supported if history settings are enabled for the Google Workspace organization. To update the space history state, you must omit all other field masks in your request. `space_history_state` is not supported with admin access. - `access_settings.audience`: Updates the [access setting](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/11971020) of who can discover the space, join the space, and preview the messages in named space where `spaceType` field is `SPACE`. If the existing space has a target audience, you can remove the audience and restrict space access by omitting a value for this field mask. To update access settings for a space, the authenticating user must be a space manager and omit all other field masks in your request. You can&#x27;t update this field if the space is in [import mode](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/import-data-overview). To learn more, see [Make a space discoverable to specific users](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/space-target-audience). `access_settings.audience` is not supported with admin access. - Developer Preview: Supports changing the [permission settings](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/13340792) of a space, supported field paths include: `permission_settings.manage_members_and_groups`, `permission_settings.modify_space_details`, `permission_settings.toggle_history`, `permission_settings.use_at_mention_all`, `permission_settings.manage_apps`, `permission_settings.manage_webhooks`, `permission_settings.reply_messages` (Warning: mutually exclusive with all other non-permission settings field paths). `permission_settings` is not supported with admin access.
  useAdminAccess: boolean, [Developer Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview). When `true`, the method runs using the user&#x27;s Google Workspace administrator privileges. The calling user must be a Google Workspace administrator with the [manage chat and spaces conversations privilege](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13369245). Requires the `chat.admin.spaces` [OAuth 2.0 scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes). Some `FieldMask` values are not supported using admin access. For details, see the description of `update_mask`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="search">search(orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, query=None, useAdminAccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>[Developer Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview). Returns a list of spaces based on a user&#x27;s search. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user). The user must be an administrator for the Google Workspace organization. In the request, set `use_admin_access` to `true`.

Args:
  orderBy: string, Optional. How the list of spaces is ordered. Supported attributes to order by are: - `membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count` — Denotes the count of human users that have directly joined a space. - `last_active_time` — Denotes the time when last eligible item is added to any topic of this space. - `create_time` — Denotes the time of the space creation. Valid ordering operation values are: - `ASC` for ascending. Default value. - `DESC` for descending. The supported syntax are: - `membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count DESC` - `membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count ASC` - `last_active_time DESC` - `last_active_time ASC` - `create_time DESC` - `create_time ASC`
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of spaces to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 spaces are returned. The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value more than 1000, it&#x27;s automatically changed to 1000.
  pageToken: string, A token, received from the previous search spaces call. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other parameters might lead to unexpected results.
  query: string, Required. A search query. You can search by using the following parameters: - `create_time` - `customer` - `display_name` - `external_user_allowed` - `last_active_time` - `space_history_state` - `space_type` `create_time` and `last_active_time` accept a timestamp in [RFC-3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format and the supported comparison operators are: `=`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=`. `customer` is required and is used to indicate which customer to fetch spaces from. `customers/my_customer` is the only supported value. `display_name` only accepts the `HAS` (`:`) operator. The text to match is first tokenized into tokens and each token is prefix-matched case-insensitively and independently as a substring anywhere in the space&#x27;s `display_name`. For example, `Fun Eve` matches `Fun event` or `The evening was fun`, but not `notFun event` or `even`. `external_user_allowed` accepts either `true` or `false`. `space_history_state` only accepts values from the [`historyState`] (https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces#Space.HistoryState) field of a `space` resource. `space_type` is required and the only valid value is `SPACE`. Across different fields, only `AND` operators are supported. A valid example is `space_type = &quot;SPACE&quot; AND display_name:&quot;Hello&quot;` and an invalid example is `space_type = &quot;SPACE&quot; OR display_name:&quot;Hello&quot;`. Among the same field, `space_type` doesn&#x27;t support `AND` or `OR` operators. `display_name`, &#x27;space_history_state&#x27;, and &#x27;external_user_allowed&#x27; only support `OR` operators. `last_active_time` and `create_time` support both `AND` and `OR` operators. `AND` can only be used to represent an interval, such as `last_active_time &lt; &quot;2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&quot; AND last_active_time &gt; &quot;2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&quot;`. The following example queries are valid: ``` customer = &quot;customers/my_customer&quot; AND space_type = &quot;SPACE&quot; customer = &quot;customers/my_customer&quot; AND space_type = &quot;SPACE&quot; AND display_name:&quot;Hello World&quot; customer = &quot;customers/my_customer&quot; AND space_type = &quot;SPACE&quot; AND (last_active_time &lt; &quot;2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&quot; OR last_active_time &gt; &quot;2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&quot;) customer = &quot;customers/my_customer&quot; AND space_type = &quot;SPACE&quot; AND (display_name:&quot;Hello World&quot; OR display_name:&quot;Fun event&quot;) AND (last_active_time &gt; &quot;2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&quot; AND last_active_time &lt; &quot;2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&quot;) customer = &quot;customers/my_customer&quot; AND space_type = &quot;SPACE&quot; AND (create_time &gt; &quot;2019-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&quot; AND create_time &lt; &quot;2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&quot;) AND (external_user_allowed = &quot;true&quot;) AND (space_history_state = &quot;HISTORY_ON&quot; OR space_history_state = &quot;HISTORY_OFF&quot;) ```

<div class="method">

  <pre>Creates a space and adds specified users to it. The calling user is automatically added to the space, and shouldn&#x27;t be specified as a membership in the request. For an example, see [Set up a space with initial members](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/set-up-spaces). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `membership.member.name`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `id` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person profile ID for `user@example.com` is `123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. To specify the Google groups to add, add memberships with the appropriate `membership.group_member.name`. To add or invite a Google group, use `groups/{group}`, where `{group}` is the `id` for the group from the Cloud Identity Groups API. For example, you can use [Cloud Identity Groups lookup API](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups/lookup) to retrieve the ID `123456789` for group email `group@example.com`, then you can add the group to the space by setting the `membership.group_member.name` to `groups/123456789`. Group email is not supported, and Google groups can only be added as members in named spaces. For a named space or group chat, if the caller blocks, or is blocked by some members, or doesn&#x27;t have permission to add some members, then those members aren&#x27;t added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn&#x27;t created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don&#x27;t specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [Invite or add a user or app to a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-members). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies aren&#x27;t supported. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS` when setting up a space, try a different `displayName`. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user).

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to create a space and add specified users to it.
  &quot;memberships&quot;: [ # Optional. The Google Chat users or groups to invite to join the space. Omit the calling user, as they are added automatically. The set currently allows up to 20 memberships (in addition to the caller). For human membership, the `Membership.member` field must contain a `user` with `name` populated (format: `users/{user}`) and `type` set to `User.Type.HUMAN`. You can only add human users when setting up a space (adding Chat apps is only supported for direct message setup with the calling app). You can also add members using the user&#x27;s email as an alias for {user}. For example, the `user.name` can be `users/example@gmail.com`. To invite Gmail users or users from external Google Workspace domains, user&#x27;s email must be used for `{user}`. For Google group membership, the `Membership.group_member` field must contain a `group` with `name` populated (format `groups/{group}`). You can only add Google groups when setting `Space.spaceType` to `SPACE`. Optional when setting `Space.spaceType` to `SPACE`. Required when setting `Space.spaceType` to `GROUP_CHAT`, along with at least two memberships. Required when setting `Space.spaceType` to `DIRECT_MESSAGE` with a human user, along with exactly one membership. Must be empty when creating a 1:1 conversation between a human and the calling Chat app (when setting `Space.spaceType` to `DIRECT_MESSAGE` and `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true`).
    { # Represents a membership relation in Google Chat, such as whether a user or Chat app is invited to, part of, or absent from a space.
      &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Immutable. The creation time of the membership, such as when a member joined or was invited to join a space. This field is output only, except when used to import historical memberships in import mode spaces.
      &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Immutable. The deletion time of the membership, such as when a member left or was removed from a space. This field is output only, except when used to import historical memberships in import mode spaces.
      &quot;groupMember&quot;: { # A Google Group in Google Chat. # The Google Group the membership corresponds to.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name for a Google Group. Represents a [group](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups) in Cloud Identity Groups API. Format: groups/{group}
      },
      &quot;member&quot;: { # A user in Google Chat. When returned as an output from a request, if your Chat app [authenticates as a user](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user), the output for a `User` resource only populates the user&#x27;s `name` and `type`. # The Google Chat user or app the membership corresponds to. If your Chat app [authenticates as a user](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user), the output populates the [user](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/User) `name` and `type`.
        &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The user&#x27;s display name.
        &quot;domainId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Unique identifier of the user&#x27;s Google Workspace domain.
        &quot;isAnonymous&quot;: True or False, # Output only. When `true`, the user is deleted or their profile is not visible.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name for a Google Chat user. Format: `users/{user}`. `users/app` can be used as an alias for the calling app bot user. For human users, `{user}` is the same user identifier as: - the `id` for the [Person](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people) in the People API. For example, `users/123456789` in Chat API represents the same person as the `123456789` Person profile ID in People API. - the `id` for a [user](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users) in the Admin SDK Directory API. - the user&#x27;s email address can be used as an alias for `{user}` in API requests. For example, if the People API Person profile ID for `user@example.com` is `123456789`, you can use `users/user@example.com` as an alias to reference `users/123456789`. Only the canonical resource name (for example `users/123456789`) will be returned from the API.
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User type.
      },
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name of the membership, assigned by the server. Format: `spaces/{space}/members/{member}`
      &quot;role&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. User&#x27;s role within a Chat space, which determines their permitted actions in the space. This field can only be used as input in `UpdateMembership`.
      &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the membership.
    },
  ],
  &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A unique identifier for this request. A random UUID is recommended. Specifying an existing request ID returns the space created with that ID instead of creating a new space. Specifying an existing request ID from the same Chat app with a different authenticated user returns an error.
  &quot;space&quot;: { # A space in Google Chat. Spaces are conversations between two or more users or 1:1 messages between a user and a Chat app. # Required. The `Space.spaceType` field is required. To create a space, set `Space.spaceType` to `SPACE` and set `Space.displayName`. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS` when setting up a space, try a different `displayName`. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name. To create a group chat, set `Space.spaceType` to `GROUP_CHAT`. Don&#x27;t set `Space.displayName`. To create a 1:1 conversation between humans, set `Space.spaceType` to `DIRECT_MESSAGE` and set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `false`. Don&#x27;t set `Space.displayName` or `Space.spaceDetails`. To create an 1:1 conversation between a human and the calling Chat app, set `Space.spaceType` to `DIRECT_MESSAGE` and `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true`. Don&#x27;t set `Space.displayName` or `Space.spaceDetails`. If a `DIRECT_MESSAGE` space already exists, that space is returned instead of creating a new space.
    &quot;accessSettings&quot;: { # Represents the [access setting](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/11971020) of the space. # Optional. Specifies the [access setting](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/11971020) of the space. Only populated when the `space_type` is `SPACE`.
      &quot;accessState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Indicates the access state of the space.
      &quot;audience&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The resource name of the [target audience](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9934697) who can discover the space, join the space, and preview the messages in the space. If unset, only users or Google Groups who have been individually invited or added to the space can access it. For details, see [Make a space discoverable to a target audience](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/space-target-audience). Format: `audiences/{audience}` To use the default target audience for the Google Workspace organization, set to `audiences/default`.
