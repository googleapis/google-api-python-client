<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#findDirectMessage">findDirectMessage(name=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns the existing direct message with the specified user. If no direct message space is found, returns a `404 NOT_FOUND` error. For an example, see [Find a direct message](/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/find-direct-message). With [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users), returns the direct message space between the specified user and the authenticated user. With [service account authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/service-accounts), returns the direct message space between the specified user and the calling Chat app. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users) or [service account authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/service-accounts).</p>

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#setup">setup(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Creates a space and adds specified users to it. The calling user is automatically added to the space, and shouldn't be specified as a membership in the request. For an example, see [Set up a space](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/set-up). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `member.name` in the `SetUpSpaceRequest`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `{person_id}` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person `resourceName` for `user@example.com` is `people/123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. For a space or group chat, if the caller blocks or is blocked by some members, then those members aren't added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn't created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don't specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [create a membership](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/create). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies aren't supported. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS` when setting up a space, try a different `displayName`. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users).</p>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists spaces the caller is a member of. Group chats and DMs aren&#x27;t listed until the first message is sent. For an example, see [List spaces](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/list). Requires [authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth). Fully supports [service account authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/service-accounts) and [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users). Lists spaces visible to the caller or authenticated user. Group chats and DMs aren&#x27;t listed until the first message is sent.

Args:
  filter: string, Optional. A query filter. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users). You can filter spaces by the space type ([`space_type`](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces#spacetype)). To filter by space type, you must specify valid enum value, such as `SPACE` or `GROUP_CHAT` (the `space_type` can&#x27;t be `SPACE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`). To query for multiple space types, use the `OR` operator. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` space_type = &quot;SPACE&quot; spaceType = &quot;GROUP_CHAT&quot; OR spaceType = &quot;DIRECT_MESSAGE&quot; ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error. With [service account authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/service-accounts), this field is ignored and the query always returns all spaces. But the Chat API still validates the query syntax with service accounts, so invalid queries are still rejected.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of spaces to return. The service might return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 spaces are returned. The maximum value is 1,000. If you use a value more than 1,000, it&#x27;s automatically changed to 1,000. Negative values return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous list spaces call. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, the filter value should match the call that provided the page token. Passing a different value may lead to unexpected results.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # You can send a token as `pageToken` to retrieve the next page of results. If empty, there are no subsequent pages.
  &quot;spaces&quot;: [ # List of spaces in the requested (or first) page.
    { # A space in Google Chat. Spaces are conversations between two or more users or 1:1 messages between a user and a Chat app.
      &quot;adminInstalled&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Whether the Chat app was installed by a Google Workspace administrator. Administrators can install a Chat app for their domain, organizational unit, or a group of users. Administrators can only install Chat apps for direct messaging between users and the app. To support admin install, your app must feature direct messaging.
      &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The space&#x27;s display name. Required when [creating a space](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces/create).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setup">setup(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a space and adds specified users to it. The calling user is automatically added to the space, and shouldn&#x27;t be specified as a membership in the request. For an example, see [Set up a space](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/set-up). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `member.name` in the `SetUpSpaceRequest`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `{person_id}` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person `resourceName` for `user@example.com` is `people/123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. For a space or group chat, if the caller blocks or is blocked by some members, then those members aren&#x27;t added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn&#x27;t created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don&#x27;t specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [create a membership](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/v1/members/create). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies aren&#x27;t supported. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS` when setting up a space, try a different `displayName`. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth/users).

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;memberships&quot;: [ # Optional. The Google Chat users to invite to join the space. Omit the calling user, as they are added automatically. The set currently allows up to 20 memberships (in addition to the caller). The `Membership.member` field must contain a `user` with `name` populated (format: `users/{user}`) and `type` set to `User.Type.HUMAN`. You can only add human users when setting up a space (adding Chat apps is only supported for direct message setup with the calling app). You can also add members using the user&#x27;s email as an alias for {user}. For example, the `user.name` can be `users/example@gmail.com`.&quot; To invite Gmail users or users from external Google Workspace domains, user&#x27;s email must be used for `{user}`. Optional when setting `Space.spaceType` to `SPACE`. Required when setting `Space.spaceType` to `GROUP_CHAT`, along with at least two memberships. Required when setting `Space.spaceType` to `DIRECT_MESSAGE` with a human user, along with exactly one membership. Must be empty when creating a 1:1 conversation between a human and the calling Chat app (when setting `Space.spaceType` to `DIRECT_MESSAGE` and `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true`).

        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name for a Google Chat user. Format: `users/{user}`. `users/app` can be used as an alias for the calling app bot user. For human users, `{user}` is the same user identifier as: - the `{person_id`} for the [Person](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people) in the People API, where the Person `resource_name` is `people/{person_id}`. For example, `users/123456789` in Chat API represents the same person as `people/123456789` in People API. - the `id` for a [user](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users) in the Admin SDK Directory API. - the user&#x27;s email address can be used as an alias for `{user}` in API requests. For example, if the People API Person `resourceName` for `user@example.com` is `people/123456789`, you can use `users/user@example.com` as an alias to reference `users/123456789`. Only the canonical resource name (for example `users/123456789`) will be returned from the API.
