Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. The format of this value varies depending on the scope of the request (project or organization) and whether you have [specified a processing location](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/specifying-location): + Projects scope, location specified: `projects/`PROJECT_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID + Projects scope, no location specified (defaults to global): `projects/`PROJECT_ID + Organizations scope, location specified: `organizations/`ORG_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID + Organizations scope, no location specified (defaults to global): `organizations/`ORG_ID The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

The format of this value varies depending on the scope of the request (project or organization) and whether you have [specified a processing location](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/specifying-location): + Projects scope, location specified: `projects/`PROJECT_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID + Projects scope, no location specified (defaults to global): `projects/`PROJECT_ID + Organizations scope, location specified: `organizations/`ORG_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID + Organizations scope, no location specified (defaults to global): `organizations/`ORG_ID The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  locationId: string, Deprecated. This field has no effect.
  orderBy: string, Comma separated list of fields to order by, followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case-insensitive, default sorting order is ascending, redundant space characters are insignificant. Example: `name asc,update_time, create_time desc` Supported fields are: - `create_time`: corresponds to time the template was created. - `update_time`: corresponds to time the template was last updated. - `name`: corresponds to template&#x27;s name. - `display_name`: corresponds to template&#x27;s display name.
  pageSize: integer, Size of the page, can be limited by server. If zero server returns a page of max size 100.
  pageToken: string, Page token to continue retrieval. Comes from previous call to `ListInspectTemplates`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Dictionary words are case-insensitive and all characters other than letters and digits in the unicode [Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane) will be replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the dictionary phrase &quot;Sam Johnson&quot; will match all three phrases &quot;sam johnson&quot;, &quot;Sam, Johnson&quot;, and &quot;Sam (Johnson)&quot;. Additionally, the characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary word &quot;jen&quot; will match the first three letters of the text &quot;jen123&quot; but will return no matches for &quot;jennifer&quot;. Dictionary words containing a large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in unexpected findings because such characters are treated as whitespace. The [limits](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/limits) page contains details about the size limits of dictionaries. For dictionaries that do not fit within these constraints, consider using `LargeCustomDictionaryConfig` in the `StoredInfoType` API. # A list of phrases to detect as a CustomInfoType.

Additionally, the characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits.
