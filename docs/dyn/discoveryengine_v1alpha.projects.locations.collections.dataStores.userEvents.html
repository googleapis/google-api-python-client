  <pre>Writes a single user event from the browser. This uses a GET request to due to browser restriction of POST-ing to a third-party domain. This method is used only by the Discovery Engine API JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager. Users should not call this method directly.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent DataStore resource name, such as `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection}/dataStores/{data_store}`. (required)
  ets: string, The event timestamp in milliseconds. This prevents browser caching of otherwise identical get requests. The name is abbreviated to reduce the payload bytes.
  uri: string, The URL including cgi-parameters but excluding the hash fragment with a length limit of 5,000 characters. This is often more useful than the referer URL, because many browsers only send the domain for third-party requests.
  userEvent: string, Required. URL encoded UserEvent proto with a length limit of 2,000,000 characters.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for payload formats that can&#x27;t be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or an HTML page. This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example: message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id = 1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
  &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP Content-Type header value specifying the content type of the body.
  &quot;data&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP request/response body as raw binary.
  &quot;extensions&quot;: [ # Application specific response metadata. Must be set in the first response for streaming APIs.

If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events, also include them in the user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events provided with prediction requests. This lets the Discovery Engine API use those custom attributes when training models and serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality. This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed.

  <pre>Deletes permanently all user events specified by the filter provided. Depending on the number of events specified by the filter, this operation could take hours or days to complete. To test a filter, use the list command first.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the catalog under which the events are created. The format is `projects/${projectId}/locations/global/collections/{$collectionId}/dataStores/${dataStoreId}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for PurgeUserEvents method.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The filter string to specify the events to be deleted with a length limit of 5,000 characters. The eligible fields for filtering are: * `eventType`: Double quoted UserEvent.event_type string. * `eventTime`: in ISO 8601 &quot;zulu&quot; format. * `userPseudoId`: Double quoted string. Specifying this will delete all events associated with a visitor. * `userId`: Double quoted string. Specifying this will delete all events associated with a user. Examples: * Deleting all events in a time range: `eventTime &gt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z&quot; eventTime &lt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z&quot;` * Deleting specific eventType: `eventType = &quot;search&quot;` * Deleting all events for a specific visitor: `userPseudoId = &quot;visitor1024&quot;` * Deleting all events inside a DataStore: `*` The filtering fields are assumed to have an implicit AND.
  &quot;force&quot;: True or False, # The `force` field is currently not supported. Purge user event requests will permanently delete all purgeable events. Once the development is complete: If `force` is set to false, the method will return the expected purge count without deleting any user events. This field will default to false if not included in the request.

This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend to use Google Analytics [Client ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId) for this field.

One example is for `search` events, the associated SearchRequest may contain a filter expression in SearchRequest.filter conforming to https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering. Similarly, for `view-item-list` events that are generated from a RecommendRequest, this field may be populated directly from RecommendRequest.filter conforming to https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering. The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
  &quot;mediaInfo&quot;: { # Media-specific user event information. # Media-specific info.
    &quot;mediaProgressDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The media progress time in seconds, if applicable. For example, if the end user has finished 90 seconds of a playback video, then MediaInfo.media_progress_duration.seconds should be set to 90.
    &quot;mediaProgressPercentage&quot;: 3.14, # Media progress should be computed using only the media_progress_duration relative to the media total length. This value must be between `[0, 1.0]` inclusive. If this is not a playback or the progress cannot be computed (e.g. ongoing livestream), this field should be unset.

    &quot;pageCategory&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The most specific category associated with a category page. To represent full path of category, use &#x27;&gt;&#x27; sign to separate different hierarchies. If &#x27;&gt;&#x27; is part of the category name, please replace it with other character(s). Category pages include special pages such as sales or promotions. For instance, a special sale page may have the category hierarchy: `&quot;pageCategory&quot; : &quot;Sales &gt; 2017 Black Friday Deals&quot;`. Required for `view-category-page` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
    &quot;pageviewId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique ID of a web page view. This should be kept the same for all user events triggered from the same pageview. For example, an item detail page view could trigger multiple events as the user is browsing the page. The `pageview_id` property should be kept the same for all these events so that they can be grouped together properly. When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in automatically.
    &quot;referrerUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The referrer URL of the current page. When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in automatically. However, some browser privacy restrictions may cause this field to be empty.

    &quot;offset&quot;: 42, # An integer that specifies the current offset for pagination (the 0-indexed starting location, amongst the products deemed by the API as relevant). See SearchRequest.offset for definition. If this field is negative, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` is returned. This can only be set for `search` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
    &quot;orderBy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The order in which products are returned, if applicable. See SearchRequest.order_by for definition and syntax. The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. This can only be set for `search` events.

  },
  &quot;sessionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique identifier for tracking a visitor session with a length limit of 128 bytes. A session is an aggregation of an end user behavior in a time span. A general guideline to populate the session_id: 1. If user has no activity for 30 min, a new session_id should be assigned. 2. The session_id should be unique across users, suggest use uuid or add UserEvent.user_pseudo_id as prefix.
  &quot;tagIds&quot;: [ # A list of identifiers for the independent experiment groups this user event belongs to. This is used to distinguish between user events associated with different experiment setups on the customer end.

    &quot;currency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Currency code. Use three-character ISO-4217 code.
    &quot;discountValue&quot;: 3.14, # The total discount(s) value applied to this transaction. This figure should be excluded from TransactionInfo.value For example, if a user paid TransactionInfo.value amount, then nominal (pre-discount) value of the transaction is the sum of TransactionInfo.value and TransactionInfo.discount_value This means that profit is calculated the same way, regardless of the discount value, and that TransactionInfo.discount_value can be larger than TransactionInfo.value: * Profit = value - tax - cost
    &quot;tax&quot;: 3.14, # All the taxes associated with the transaction.
    &quot;transactionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The transaction ID with a length limit of 128 characters.

  },
  &quot;userInfo&quot;: { # Information of an end user. # Information about the end user.
    &quot;userAgent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User agent as included in the HTTP header. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. This should not be set when using the client side event reporting with GTM or JavaScript tag in UserEventService.CollectUserEvent or if UserEvent.direct_user_request is set.
    &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Highly recommended for logged-in users. Unique identifier for logged-in user, such as a user name. Don&#x27;t set for anonymous users. Always use a hashed value for this ID. Don&#x27;t set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
  },
  &quot;userPseudoId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if the visitor log in/out of the website. Do not set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend to use Google Analytics [Client ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId) for this field.
