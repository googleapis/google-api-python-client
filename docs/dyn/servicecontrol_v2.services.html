It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and must not be changed. UID is used to uniquely identify resources with resource name reuses. This should be a UUID4.
      &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was last updated. Any change to the resource made by users must refresh this value. Changes to a resource made by the service should refresh this value.

Measured from when the destination service starts to send the request to the backend until when the destination service receives the complete response from the backend.
