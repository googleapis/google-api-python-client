Warning: If you specify the password using plain text, you risk the password being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the password instead.

You can either specify the username directly by using plain text or specify an encrypted username by using a Secret Manager secret: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. However, using a secret is recommended for enhanced security. Caution: If you specify the username using plain text, you risk the username being exposed to any users who can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that contains the username instead. Learn more about [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [using Secret Manager with Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/create-run-job-secret-manager).

If the `TaskSpec.Volumes` field is specified but this field is not, Batch will mount each volume from the host machine to the container with the same mount path by default. In this case, the default mount option for containers will be read-only (`ro`) for existing persistent disks and read-write (`rw`) for other volume types, regardless of the original mount options specified in `TaskSpec.Volumes`. If you need different mount settings, you can explicitly configure them in this field.
