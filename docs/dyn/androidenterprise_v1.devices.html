See restrict accounts in Google Play. When provisioning a new device, you should set the device policy using this method before adding the managed Google Play Account to the device, otherwise the policy will not be applied for a short period of time after adding the account to the device.</p>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setState">setState(enterpriseId, userId, deviceId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets whether a device&#x27;s access to Google services is enabled or disabled. The device state takes effect only if enforcing EMM policies on Android devices is enabled in the Google Admin Console. Otherwise, the device state is ignored and all devices are allowed access to Google services. This is only supported for Google-managed users.

Args:
  enterpriseId: string, The ID of the enterprise. (required)
  userId: string, The ID of the user. (required)
  deviceId: string, The ID of the device. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The state of a user&#x27;s device, as accessed by the getState and setState methods on device resources.
  &quot;accountState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The state of the Google account on the device. &quot;enabled&quot; indicates that the Google account on the device can be used to access Google services (including Google Play), while &quot;disabled&quot; means that it cannot.

}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;accountState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The state of the Google account on the device. &quot;enabled&quot; indicates that the Google account on the device can be used to access Google services (including Google Play), while &quot;disabled&quot; means that it cannot.

  <pre>Updates the device policy. To ensure the policy is properly enforced, you need to prevent unmanaged accounts from accessing Google Play by setting the allowed_accounts in the managed configuration for the Google Play package. See restrict accounts in Google Play. When provisioning a new device, you should set the device policy using this method before adding the managed Google Play Account to the device, otherwise the policy will not be applied for a short period of time after adding the account to the device.
