  <pre>Retrieves a list of placement groups, possibly filtered. This method supports paging.

Args:
  profileId: string, User profile ID associated with this request. (required)
  siteIds: string, Select only placement groups that are associated with these sites. (repeated)
  placementGroupType: string, Select only placement groups belonging with this group type. A package is a simple group of placements that acts as a single pricing point for a group of tags. A roadblock is a group of placements that not only acts as a single pricing point but also assumes that all the tags in it will be served at the same time. A roadblock requires one of its assigned placements to be marked as primary for reporting.
    Allowed values
      PLACEMENT_PACKAGE - 
      PLACEMENT_ROADBLOCK - 
  pricingTypes: string, Select only placement groups with these pricing types. (repeated)
    Allowed values
      PRICING_TYPE_CPA - 
      PRICING_TYPE_CPC - 
      PRICING_TYPE_CPM - 
      PRICING_TYPE_CPM_ACTIVEVIEW - 
      PRICING_TYPE_FLAT_RATE_CLICKS - 
      PRICING_TYPE_FLAT_RATE_IMPRESSIONS - 
  campaignIds: string, Select only placement groups that belong to these campaigns. (repeated)
  advertiserIds: string, Select only placement groups that belong to these advertisers. (repeated)
  pageToken: string, Value of the nextPageToken from the previous result page.
  maxStartDate: string, Select only placements or placement groups whose start date is on or before the specified maxStartDate. The date should be formatted as "yyyy-MM-dd".
  sortOrder: string, Order of sorted results.
    Allowed values
      ASCENDING - 
      DESCENDING - 
  maxEndDate: string, Select only placements or placement groups whose end date is on or before the specified maxEndDate. The date should be formatted as "yyyy-MM-dd".
  placementStrategyIds: string, Select only placement groups that are associated with these placement strategies. (repeated)
  contentCategoryIds: string, Select only placement groups that are associated with these content categories. (repeated)
  archived: boolean, Select only archived placements. Don't set this field to select both archived and non-archived placements.
  maxResults: integer, Maximum number of results to return.
  minStartDate: string, Select only placements or placement groups whose start date is on or after the specified minStartDate. The date should be formatted as "yyyy-MM-dd".
  searchString: string, Allows searching for placement groups by name or ID. Wildcards (*) are allowed. For example, "placement*2015" will return placement groups with names like "placement group June 2015", "placement group May 2015", or simply "placements 2015". Most of the searches also add wildcards implicitly at the start and the end of the search string. For example, a search string of "placementgroup" will match placement groups with name "my placementgroup", "placementgroup 2015", or simply "placementgroup".
  minEndDate: string, Select only placements or placement groups whose end date is on or after the specified minEndDate. The date should be formatted as "yyyy-MM-dd".
  directorySiteIds: string, Select only placement groups that are associated with these directory sites. (repeated)
