  <pre>Retrieves the list of all UrlMap resources, regional and global, available to the specified project. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

Args:
  project: string, Name of the project scoping this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.
  includeAllScopes: boolean, Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code.
  serviceProjectNumber: string, The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.
  &quot;items&quot;: { # A list of UrlMapsScopedList resources.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: { # Name of the scope containing this set of UrlMaps.
      &quot;urlMaps&quot;: [ # A list of UrlMaps contained in this scope.
        { # Represents a URL Map resource. Compute Engine has two URL Map resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/urlMaps) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionUrlMaps) A URL map resource is a component of certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic Director: * urlMaps are used by global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal Application Load Balancers. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal Application Load Balancers, regional external Application Load Balancers and regional internal Application Load Balancers. For a list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table. This resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map Concepts.
          &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
          &quot;defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy&quot;: { # Specifies the custom error response policy that must be applied when the backend service or backend bucket responds with an error. # defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. This policy takes effect at the load balancer level and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at lower levels like PathMatcher, RouteRule and PathRule within this UrlMap. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing policies for responding to 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher configured for *.example.com has defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy for 4xx. If a request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404, the policy in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When the request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 502, the policy in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When a request that does not match any host in *.example.com such as http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a 404, UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client. defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.
            &quot;errorResponseRules&quot;: [ # Specifies rules for returning error responses. In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority. For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX). If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.
              { # Specifies the mapping between the response code that will be returned along with the custom error content and the response code returned by the backend service.
                &quot;matchResponseCodes&quot;: [ # Valid values include: - A number between 400 and 599: For example 401 or 503, in which case the load balancer applies the policy if the error code exactly matches this value. - 5xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 500 to 599. - 4xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 400 to 499. Values must be unique within matchResponseCodes and across all errorResponseRules of CustomErrorResponsePolicy.
                  &quot;A String&quot;,
                ],
                &quot;overrideResponseCode&quot;: 42, # The HTTP status code returned with the response containing the custom error content. If overrideResponseCode is not supplied, the same response code returned by the original backend bucket or backend service is returned to the client.
                &quot;path&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full path to a file within backendBucket . For example: /errors/defaultError.html path must start with a leading slash. path cannot have trailing slashes. If the file is not available in backendBucket or the load balancer cannot reach the BackendBucket, a simple Not Found Error is returned to the client. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters
              },
            ],
            &quot;errorService&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full or partial URL to the BackendBucket resource that contains the custom error content. Examples are: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket If errorService is not specified at lower levels like pathMatcher, pathRule and routeRule, an errorService specified at a higher level in the UrlMap will be used. If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService. If load balancer cannot reach the backendBucket, a simple Not Found Error will be returned, with the original response code (or overrideResponseCode if configured). errorService is not supported for internal or regional HTTP/HTTPS load balancers.
          },
          &quot;defaultRouteAction&quot;: { # defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set. URL maps for classic Application Load Balancers only support the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction. defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  urlMap: string, Name of the UrlMap resource to delete. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  <pre>Returns the specified UrlMap resource.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  urlMap: string, Name of the UrlMap resource to return. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents a URL Map resource. Compute Engine has two URL Map resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/urlMaps) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionUrlMaps) A URL map resource is a component of certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic Director: * urlMaps are used by global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal Application Load Balancers. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal Application Load Balancers, regional external Application Load Balancers and regional internal Application Load Balancers. For a list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table. This resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map Concepts.

  &quot;defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy&quot;: { # Specifies the custom error response policy that must be applied when the backend service or backend bucket responds with an error. # defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. This policy takes effect at the load balancer level and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at lower levels like PathMatcher, RouteRule and PathRule within this UrlMap. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing policies for responding to 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher configured for *.example.com has defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy for 4xx. If a request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404, the policy in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When the request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 502, the policy in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When a request that does not match any host in *.example.com such as http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a 404, UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client. defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.
    &quot;errorResponseRules&quot;: [ # Specifies rules for returning error responses. In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority. For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX). If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.
      { # Specifies the mapping between the response code that will be returned along with the custom error content and the response code returned by the backend service.
        &quot;matchResponseCodes&quot;: [ # Valid values include: - A number between 400 and 599: For example 401 or 503, in which case the load balancer applies the policy if the error code exactly matches this value. - 5xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 500 to 599. - 4xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 400 to 499. Values must be unique within matchResponseCodes and across all errorResponseRules of CustomErrorResponsePolicy.

For example: /errors/defaultError.html path must start with a leading slash. path cannot have trailing slashes. If the file is not available in backendBucket or the load balancer cannot reach the BackendBucket, a simple Not Found Error is returned to the client. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters
      },

    &quot;errorService&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full or partial URL to the BackendBucket resource that contains the custom error content. Examples are: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket If errorService is not specified at lower levels like pathMatcher, pathRule and routeRule, an errorService specified at a higher level in the UrlMap will be used. If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService. If load balancer cannot reach the backendBucket, a simple Not Found Error will be returned, with the original response code (or overrideResponseCode if configured). errorService is not supported for internal or regional HTTP/HTTPS load balancers.
  },
  &quot;defaultRouteAction&quot;: { # defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set. URL maps for classic Application Load Balancers only support the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction. defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.

    <code class="details" id="insert">insert(project, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a UrlMap resource in the specified project using the data included in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a URL Map resource. Compute Engine has two URL Map resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/urlMaps) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionUrlMaps) A URL map resource is a component of certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic Director: * urlMaps are used by global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal Application Load Balancers. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal Application Load Balancers, regional external Application Load Balancers and regional internal Application Load Balancers. For a list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table. This resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map Concepts.
  &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy&quot;: { # Specifies the custom error response policy that must be applied when the backend service or backend bucket responds with an error. # defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. This policy takes effect at the load balancer level and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at lower levels like PathMatcher, RouteRule and PathRule within this UrlMap. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing policies for responding to 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher configured for *.example.com has defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy for 4xx. If a request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404, the policy in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When the request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 502, the policy in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When a request that does not match any host in *.example.com such as http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a 404, UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client. defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.
    &quot;errorResponseRules&quot;: [ # Specifies rules for returning error responses. In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority. For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX). If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.
      { # Specifies the mapping between the response code that will be returned along with the custom error content and the response code returned by the backend service.
        &quot;matchResponseCodes&quot;: [ # Valid values include: - A number between 400 and 599: For example 401 or 503, in which case the load balancer applies the policy if the error code exactly matches this value. - 5xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 500 to 599. - 4xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 400 to 499. Values must be unique within matchResponseCodes and across all errorResponseRules of CustomErrorResponsePolicy.

        &quot;path&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full path to a file within backendBucket . For example: /errors/defaultError.html path must start with a leading slash. path cannot have trailing slashes. If the file is not available in backendBucket or the load balancer cannot reach the BackendBucket, a simple Not Found Error is returned to the client. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters
      },
    ],
    &quot;errorService&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full or partial URL to the BackendBucket resource that contains the custom error content. Examples are: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket If errorService is not specified at lower levels like pathMatcher, pathRule and routeRule, an errorService specified at a higher level in the UrlMap will be used. If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService. If load balancer cannot reach the backendBucket, a simple Not Found Error will be returned, with the original response code (or overrideResponseCode if configured). errorService is not supported for internal or regional HTTP/HTTPS load balancers.
  },
  &quot;defaultRouteAction&quot;: { # defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend.

Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of UrlMap resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Contains a list of UrlMap resources.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.
  &quot;items&quot;: [ # A list of UrlMap resources.
    { # Represents a URL Map resource. Compute Engine has two URL Map resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/urlMaps) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionUrlMaps) A URL map resource is a component of certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic Director: * urlMaps are used by global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal Application Load Balancers. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal Application Load Balancers, regional external Application Load Balancers and regional internal Application Load Balancers. For a list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table. This resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map Concepts.
      &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
      &quot;defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy&quot;: { # Specifies the custom error response policy that must be applied when the backend service or backend bucket responds with an error. # defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. This policy takes effect at the load balancer level and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at lower levels like PathMatcher, RouteRule and PathRule within this UrlMap. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing policies for responding to 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher configured for *.example.com has defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy for 4xx. If a request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404, the policy in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When the request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 502, the policy in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When a request that does not match any host in *.example.com such as http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a 404, UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client. defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.
        &quot;errorResponseRules&quot;: [ # Specifies rules for returning error responses. In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority. For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX). If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.
          { # Specifies the mapping between the response code that will be returned along with the custom error content and the response code returned by the backend service.
            &quot;matchResponseCodes&quot;: [ # Valid values include: - A number between 400 and 599: For example 401 or 503, in which case the load balancer applies the policy if the error code exactly matches this value. - 5xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 500 to 599. - 4xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 400 to 499. Values must be unique within matchResponseCodes and across all errorResponseRules of CustomErrorResponsePolicy.

            ],
            &quot;overrideResponseCode&quot;: 42, # The HTTP status code returned with the response containing the custom error content. If overrideResponseCode is not supplied, the same response code returned by the original backend bucket or backend service is returned to the client.
            &quot;path&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full path to a file within backendBucket . For example: /errors/defaultError.html path must start with a leading slash. path cannot have trailing slashes. If the file is not available in backendBucket or the load balancer cannot reach the BackendBucket, a simple Not Found Error is returned to the client. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters
          },
        ],
        &quot;errorService&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full or partial URL to the BackendBucket resource that contains the custom error content. Examples are: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket If errorService is not specified at lower levels like pathMatcher, pathRule and routeRule, an errorService specified at a higher level in the UrlMap will be used. If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService. If load balancer cannot reach the backendBucket, a simple Not Found Error will be returned, with the original response code (or overrideResponseCode if configured). errorService is not supported for internal or regional HTTP/HTTPS load balancers.
      },
      &quot;defaultRouteAction&quot;: { # defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set. URL maps for classic Application Load Balancers only support the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction. defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.

For a list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table. This resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map Concepts.

This policy takes effect at the load balancer level and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at lower levels like PathMatcher, RouteRule and PathRule within this UrlMap. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing policies for responding to 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher configured for *.example.com has defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy for 4xx. If a request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404, the policy in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When the request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 502, the policy in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When a request that does not match any host in *.example.com such as http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a 404, UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client. defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.

If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.

If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="update">update(project, urlMap, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the specified UrlMap resource with the data included in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  urlMap: string, Name of the UrlMap resource to update. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a URL Map resource. Compute Engine has two URL Map resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/urlMaps) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionUrlMaps) A URL map resource is a component of certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic Director: * urlMaps are used by global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal Application Load Balancers. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal Application Load Balancers, regional external Application Load Balancers and regional internal Application Load Balancers. For a list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table. This resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map Concepts.
  &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy&quot;: { # Specifies the custom error response policy that must be applied when the backend service or backend bucket responds with an error. # defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. This policy takes effect at the load balancer level and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at lower levels like PathMatcher, RouteRule and PathRule within this UrlMap. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing policies for responding to 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher configured for *.example.com has defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy for 4xx. If a request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404, the policy in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When the request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 502, the policy in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When a request that does not match any host in *.example.com such as http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a 404, UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client. defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.
    &quot;errorResponseRules&quot;: [ # Specifies rules for returning error responses. In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority. For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX). If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.
      { # Specifies the mapping between the response code that will be returned along with the custom error content and the response code returned by the backend service.
        &quot;matchResponseCodes&quot;: [ # Valid values include: - A number between 400 and 599: For example 401 or 503, in which case the load balancer applies the policy if the error code exactly matches this value. - 5xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 500 to 599. - 4xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 400 to 499. Values must be unique within matchResponseCodes and across all errorResponseRules of CustomErrorResponsePolicy.

        &quot;path&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full path to a file within backendBucket . For example: /errors/defaultError.html path must start with a leading slash. path cannot have trailing slashes. If the file is not available in backendBucket or the load balancer cannot reach the BackendBucket, a simple Not Found Error is returned to the client. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters
      },

Examples are: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket - global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket If errorService is not specified at lower levels like pathMatcher, pathRule and routeRule, an errorService specified at a higher level in the UrlMap will be used. If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService. If load balancer cannot reach the backendBucket, a simple Not Found Error will be returned, with the original response code (or overrideResponseCode if configured). errorService is not supported for internal or regional HTTP/HTTPS load balancers.

Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.

If an error code does not have a policy defined in defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, then a policy defined for the error code in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="validate">validate(project, urlMap, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Runs static validation for the UrlMap. In particular, the tests of the provided UrlMap will be run. Calling this method does NOT create the UrlMap.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  urlMap: string, Name of the UrlMap resource to be validated as. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;loadBalancingSchemes&quot;: [ # Specifies the load balancer type(s) this validation request is for. Use EXTERNAL_MANAGED for global external Application Load Balancers and regional external Application Load Balancers. Use EXTERNAL for classic Application Load Balancers. Use INTERNAL_MANAGED for internal Application Load Balancers. For more information, refer to Choosing a load balancer. If unspecified, the load balancing scheme will be inferred from the backend service resources this URL map references. If that can not be inferred (for example, this URL map only references backend buckets, or this Url map is for rewrites and redirects only and doesn&#x27;t reference any backends), EXTERNAL will be used as the default type. If specified, the scheme(s) must not conflict with the load balancing scheme of the backend service resources this Url map references.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;resource&quot;: { # Represents a URL Map resource. Compute Engine has two URL Map resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/urlMaps) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionUrlMaps) A URL map resource is a component of certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic Director: * urlMaps are used by global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, and cross-region internal Application Load Balancers. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal Application Load Balancers, regional external Application Load Balancers and regional internal Application Load Balancers. For a list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load balancing features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director features: Routing and traffic management table. This resource defines mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a backend bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have a loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map Concepts. # Content of the UrlMap to be validated.

    &quot;defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy&quot;: { # Specifies the custom error response policy that must be applied when the backend service or backend bucket responds with an error. # defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. This policy takes effect at the load balancer level and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at lower levels like PathMatcher, RouteRule and PathRule within this UrlMap. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: - defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing policies for responding to 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher configured for *.example.com has defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy for 4xx. If a request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404, the policy in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When the request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 502, the policy in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When a request that does not match any host in *.example.com such as http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a 404, UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client. defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.
      &quot;errorResponseRules&quot;: [ # Specifies rules for returning error responses. In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority. For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX). If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.
        { # Specifies the mapping between the response code that will be returned along with the custom error content and the response code returned by the backend service.
          &quot;matchResponseCodes&quot;: [ # Valid values include: - A number between 400 and 599: For example 401 or 503, in which case the load balancer applies the policy if the error code exactly matches this value. - 5xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 500 to 599. - 4xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 400 to 499. Values must be unique within matchResponseCodes and across all errorResponseRules of CustomErrorResponsePolicy.

For example: /errors/defaultError.html path must start with a leading slash. path cannot have trailing slashes. If the file is not available in backendBucket or the load balancer cannot reach the BackendBucket, a simple Not Found Error is returned to the client. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters

If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService. If load balancer cannot reach the backendBucket, a simple Not Found Error will be returned, with the original response code (or overrideResponseCode if configured). errorService is not supported for internal or regional HTTP/HTTPS load balancers.

The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend.

Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set. URL maps for classic Application Load Balancers only support the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction. defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.
