<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="abandonInstances">abandonInstances(project, region, instanceGroupManager, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Flags the specified instances to be immediately removed from the managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the status of the abandoning action with the listmanagedinstances method.

If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, Name of the managed instance group. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;instances&quot;: [ # The URLs of one or more instances to abandon. This can be a full URL or a partial URL, such as zones/[ZONE]/instances/[INSTANCE_NAME].
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;instances&quot;: [ # [Required] List of specifications of per-instance configs.
    {
      &quot;fingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Fingerprint of this per-instance config. This field can be used in optimistic locking. It is ignored when inserting a per-instance config. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update an existing per-instance config or the field needs to be unset.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of a per-instance config and its corresponding instance. Serves as a merge key during UpdatePerInstanceConfigs operations, that is, if a per-instance config with the same name exists then it will be updated, otherwise a new one will be created for the VM instance with the same name. An attempt to create a per-instance config for a VM instance that either doesn&#x27;t exist or is not part of the group will result in an error.
      &quot;preservedState&quot;: { # Preserved state for a given instance. # The intended preserved state for the given instance. Does not contain preserved state generated from a stateful policy.
        &quot;disks&quot;: { # Preserved disks defined for this instance. This map is keyed with the device names of the disks.

            &quot;autoDelete&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # These stateful disks will never be deleted during autohealing, update, instance recreate operations. This flag is used to configure if the disk should be deleted after it is no longer used by the group, e.g. when the given instance or the whole MIG is deleted. Note: disks attached in READ_ONLY mode cannot be auto-deleted.
            &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in READ_WRITE mode.
            &quot;source&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL of the disk resource that is stateful and should be attached to the VM instance.
          },
        },
        &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Preserved metadata defined for this instance.
          &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
        },
      },
      &quot;status&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The status of applying this per-instance config on the corresponding managed instance.
    },
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="deleteInstances">deleteInstances(project, region, instanceGroupManager, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be immediately deleted. The instances are also removed from any target pools of which they were a member. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you delete. The deleteInstances operation is marked DONE if the deleteInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the deleting action with the listmanagedinstances method.

If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, Name of the managed instance group. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, region, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of managed instance groups that are contained within the specified region.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

    <code class="details" id="listErrors">listErrors(project, region, instanceGroupManager, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all errors thrown by actions on instances for a given regional managed instance group. The filter and orderBy query parameters are not supported.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. This should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, The name of the managed instance group. It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long integer: must match regexp pattern: (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|[1-9][0-9]{0,19}. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

Returns:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="listManagedInstances_next">listManagedInstances_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="listPerInstanceConfigs">listPerInstanceConfigs(project, region, instanceGroupManager, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all of the per-instance configs defined for the managed instance group. The orderBy query parameter is not supported.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request, should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="resize">resize(project, region, instanceGroupManager, size, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Changes the intended size of the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more instances.

The resize operation is marked DONE if the resize request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the creating or deleting actions with the listmanagedinstances method.

If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, Name of the managed instance group. (required)
  size: integer, Number of instances that should exist in this instance group manager. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="updatePerInstanceConfigs">updatePerInstanceConfigs(project, region, instanceGroupManager, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Inserts or updates per-instance configs for the managed instance group. perInstanceConfig.name serves as a key used to distinguish whether to perform insert or patch.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request, should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # RegionInstanceGroupManagers.updatePerInstanceConfigs
  &quot;perInstanceConfigs&quot;: [ # The list of per-instance configs to insert or patch on this managed instance group.
    {
      &quot;fingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Fingerprint of this per-instance config. This field can be used in optimistic locking. It is ignored when inserting a per-instance config. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update an existing per-instance config or the field needs to be unset.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of a per-instance config and its corresponding instance. Serves as a merge key during UpdatePerInstanceConfigs operations, that is, if a per-instance config with the same name exists then it will be updated, otherwise a new one will be created for the VM instance with the same name. An attempt to create a per-instance config for a VM instance that either doesn&#x27;t exist or is not part of the group will result in an error.
      &quot;preservedState&quot;: { # Preserved state for a given instance. # The intended preserved state for the given instance. Does not contain preserved state generated from a stateful policy.
        &quot;disks&quot;: { # Preserved disks defined for this instance. This map is keyed with the device names of the disks.
          &quot;a_key&quot;: {
            &quot;autoDelete&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # These stateful disks will never be deleted during autohealing, update, instance recreate operations. This flag is used to configure if the disk should be deleted after it is no longer used by the group, e.g. when the given instance or the whole MIG is deleted. Note: disks attached in READ_ONLY mode cannot be auto-deleted.
            &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in READ_WRITE mode.
            &quot;source&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL of the disk resource that is stateful and should be attached to the VM instance.
          },
        },
        &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Preserved metadata defined for this instance.
          &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
        },
      },
      &quot;status&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The status of applying this per-instance config on the corresponding managed instance.
    },
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:
