  <pre>Creates a new AuthzPolicy in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the `AuthzPolicy` resource. Must be in the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # `AuthzPolicy` is a resource that allows to forward traffic to a callout backend designed to scan the traffic for security purposes.
  &quot;action&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Can be one of ALLOW, DENY, CUSTOM. When the action is CUSTOM, customProvider must be specified. When the action is ALLOW, only requests matching the policy will be allowed. When the action is DENY, only requests matching the policy will be denied. When a request arrives, the policies are evaluated in the following order: 1. If there is a CUSTOM policy that matches the request, the CUSTOM policy is evaluated using the custom authorization providers and the request is denied if the provider rejects the request. 2. If there are any DENY policies that match the request, the request is denied. 3. If there are no ALLOW policies for the resource or if any of the ALLOW policies match the request, the request is allowed. 4. Else the request is denied by default if none of the configured AuthzPolicies with ALLOW action match the request.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;customProvider&quot;: { # Allows delegating authorization decisions to Cloud IAP or to Service Extensions. # Optional. Required if the action is CUSTOM. Allows delegating authorization decisions to Cloud IAP or to Service Extensions. One of cloudIap or authzExtension must be specified.

Enabling Cloud IAP at the AuthzPolicy level is not compatible with Cloud IAP settings in the BackendService. Enabling IAP in both places will result in request failure. Ensure that IAP is enabled in either the AuthzPolicy or the BackendService but not in both places. # Optional. Delegates authorization decisions to Cloud IAP.

  <pre>Lists AuthzPolicies in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project and location from which the `AuthzPolicy` resources are listed, specified in the following format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Filtering results.
  orderBy: string, Optional. Hint for how to order the results.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. Requested page size. The server might return fewer items than requested. If unspecified, the server picks an appropriate default.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A token identifying a page of results that the server returns.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

When the action is ALLOW, only requests matching the policy will be allowed. When the action is DENY, only requests matching the policy will be denied. When a request arrives, the policies are evaluated in the following order: 1. If there is a CUSTOM policy that matches the request, the CUSTOM policy is evaluated using the custom authorization providers and the request is denied if the provider rejects the request. 2. If there are any DENY policies that match the request, the request is denied. 3. If there are no ALLOW policies for the resource or if any of the ALLOW policies match the request, the request is allowed. 4. Else the request is denied by default if none of the configured AuthzPolicies with ALLOW action match the request.

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server can ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `AuthzPolicy` resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field is overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not specify a mask, then all fields are overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
