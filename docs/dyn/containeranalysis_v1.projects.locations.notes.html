  <pre>Creates new notes in batch.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project in the form of `projects/[PROJECT_ID]`, under which the notes are to be created. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

For example, an organization might have one `Authority` for &quot;QA&quot; and one for &quot;build&quot;. This note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they don&#x27;t all live in the same project. # A note describing an attestation role.

Because the name of a note acts as its resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes) from &quot;readable&quot; names more suitable for debug output. Note that these hints should not be used to look up authorities in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up attestations to verify. # Hint hints at the purpose of the attestation authority.
