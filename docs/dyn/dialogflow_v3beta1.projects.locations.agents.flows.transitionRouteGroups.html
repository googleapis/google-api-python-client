Args:
  parent: string, Required. The flow to create an TransitionRouteGroup for. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An TransitionRouteGroup represents a group of `TransitionRoutes` to be used by a Page.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human-readable name of the transition route group, unique within the flow. The display name can be no longer than 30 characters.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique identifier of the transition route group. TransitionRouteGroups.CreateTransitionRouteGroup populates the name automatically. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows//transitionRouteGroups/`.
  &quot;transitionRoutes&quot;: [ # Transition routes associated with the TransitionRouteGroup.
    { # A transition route specifies a intent that can be matched and/or a data condition that can be evaluated during a session. When a specified transition is matched, the following actions are taken in order: * If there is a `trigger_fulfillment` associated with the transition, it will be called. * If there is a `target_page` associated with the transition, the session will transition into the specified page. * If there is a `target_flow` associated with the transition, the session will transition into the specified flow.
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The condition to evaluate against form parameters or session parameters. See the [conditions reference](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/condition). At least one of `intent` or `condition` must be specified. When both `intent` and `condition` are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.
      &quot;intent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique identifier of an Intent. Format: `projects//locations//agents//intents/`. Indicates that the transition can only happen when the given intent is matched. At least one of `intent` or `condition` must be specified. When both `intent` and `condition` are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of this transition route.
      &quot;targetFlow&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The target flow to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows/`.
      &quot;targetPage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The target page to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows//pages/`.
      &quot;triggerFulfillment&quot;: { # A fulfillment can do one or more of the following actions at the same time: * Generate rich message responses. * Set parameter values. * Call the webhook. Fulfillments can be called at various stages in the Page or Form lifecycle. For example, when a DetectIntentRequest drives a session to enter a new page, the page&#x27;s entry fulfillment can add a static response to the QueryResult in the returning DetectIntentResponse, call the webhook (for example, to load user data from a database), or both. # The fulfillment to call when the condition is satisfied. At least one of `trigger_fulfillment` and `target` must be specified. When both are defined, `trigger_fulfillment` is executed first.
        &quot;conditionalCases&quot;: [ # Conditional cases for this fulfillment.
          { # A list of cascading if-else conditions. Cases are mutually exclusive. The first one with a matching condition is selected, all the rest ignored.
            &quot;cases&quot;: [ # A list of cascading if-else conditions.
              { # Each case has a Boolean condition. When it is evaluated to be True, the corresponding messages will be selected and evaluated recursively.
                &quot;caseContent&quot;: [ # A list of case content.
                  { # The list of messages or conditional cases to activate for this case.
                    &quot;additionalCases&quot;: # Object with schema name: GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3beta1FulfillmentConditionalCases # Additional cases to be evaluated.
                    &quot;message&quot;: { # Represents a response message that can be returned by a conversational agent. Response messages are also used for output audio synthesis. The approach is as follows: * If at least one OutputAudioText response is present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated as either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. * Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. This approach allows for more sophisticated user experience scenarios, where the text displayed to the user may differ from what is heard. # Returned message.

The approach is as follows: * If at least one OutputAudioText response is present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated as either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. * Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. This approach allows for more sophisticated user experience scenarios, where the text displayed to the user may differ from what is heard.
