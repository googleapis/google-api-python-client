  <pre>Gets the billing information for a project. The current authenticated user
must have [permission to view the
project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo
).

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the project for which billing information is
retrieved. For example, `projects/tokyo-rain-123`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

      # has at most one associated billing account at a time (but a billing account
      # can be assigned to multiple projects).

    "billingEnabled": True or False, # True if the project is associated with an open billing account, to which
        # usage on the project is charged. False if the project is associated with a

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="updateBillingInfo">updateBillingInfo(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets or updates the billing account associated with a project. You specify
the new billing account by setting the `billing_account_name` in the
`ProjectBillingInfo` resource to the resource name of a billing account.
Associating a project with an open billing account enables billing on the
project and allows charges for resource usage. If the project already had a
billing account, this method changes the billing account used for resource
usage charges.

*Note:* Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in the transaction
history of the Google Cloud Console may be billed to the new billing
account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing account was
assigned to the project.

The current authenticated user must have ownership privileges for both the
[project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo
) and the [billing
account](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/4430947).

You can disable billing on the project by setting the
`billing_account_name` field to empty. This action disassociates the
current billing account from the project. Any billable activity of your
in-use services will stop, and your application could stop functioning as
expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be billed to the previously
associated account. The current authenticated user must be either an owner
of the project or an owner of the billing account for the project.

Note that associating a project with a *closed* billing account will have
much the same effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid
resources used by the project will be shut down. Thus, unless you wish to
disable billing, you should always call this method with the name of an
*open* billing account.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the project associated with the billing information
that you want to update. For example, `projects/tokyo-rain-123`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:
