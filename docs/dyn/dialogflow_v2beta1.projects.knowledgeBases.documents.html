        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
        # three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
        #
        # You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
        # [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the

        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`

        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
