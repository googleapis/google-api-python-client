Args:
  parent: string, Required. The Google Cloud resource that will parent the new policy. Must be in one of the following forms: * `projects/{project_number}` * `projects/{project_id}` * `folders/{folder_id}` * `organizations/{organization_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.

  <pre>Deletes a policy. Returns a `google.rpc.Status` with `google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND` if the constraint or organization policy does not exist.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the policy to delete. See the policy entry for naming rules. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

Args:
  name: string, Required. Resource name of the policy. See `Policy` for naming requirements. (required)

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getEffectivePolicy">getEffectivePolicy(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the effective policy on a resource. This is the result of merging policies in the resource hierarchy and evaluating conditions. The returned policy will not have an `etag` or `condition` set because it is an evaluated policy across multiple resources. Subtrees of Resource Manager resource hierarchy with &#x27;under:&#x27; prefix will not be expanded.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The effective policy to compute. See `Policy` for naming rules. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
