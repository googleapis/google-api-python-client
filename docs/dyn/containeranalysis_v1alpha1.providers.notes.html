<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a note or an `Occurrence` resource.
Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or
`containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is
a note or occurrence, respectively.
Attempting to call this method on a resource without the required
permission will result in a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error. Attempting to call
this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error
if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED`
error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}` for occurrences and
projects/{PROJECT_ID}/notes/{NOTE_ID} for notes

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.
    &quot;options&quot;: { # Encapsulates settings provided to GetIamPolicy. # OPTIONAL: A `GetPolicyOptions` object for specifying options to
        # `GetIamPolicy`.
      &quot;requestedPolicyVersion&quot;: 42, # Optional. The policy format version to be returned.
          #
          # Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
          # rejected.
          #
          # Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.
          # Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
          # leave the field unset.
          #
          # To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
          # [IAM

    },
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

      # controls for Google Cloud resources.

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.

        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified `Note` or `Occurrence`.
Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or
`containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is
a `Note` or an `Occurrence`, respectively.
Attempting to call this method without these permissions will result in a `
`PERMISSION_DENIED` error.
Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a
`NOT_FOUND` error if the user has `containeranalysis.notes.list` permission
on a `Note` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.list` on an `Occurrence`, or
a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following
formats: `projects/{projectid}/occurrences/{occurrenceid}` for occurrences
and projects/{projectid}/notes/{noteid} for notes

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
    &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`. The size of

        # might reject them.

        # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
        # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
        # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
        # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
        # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
