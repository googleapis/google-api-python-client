<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="bulkMute">bulkMute(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Kicks off an LRO to bulk mute findings for a parent based on a filter. The parent can be either an organization, folder or project. The findings matched by the filter will be muted after the LRO is done.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent, at which bulk action needs to be applied. Its format is `organizations/[organization_id]`, `folders/[folder_id]`, `projects/[project_id]`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for bulk findings update. Note: 1. If multiple bulk update requests match the same resource, the order in which they get executed is not defined. 2. Once a bulk operation is started, there is no way to stop it.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Expression that identifies findings that should be updated. The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the corresponding resource. The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.
  &quot;muteAnnotation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This can be a mute configuration name or any identifier for mute/unmute of findings based on the filter.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
