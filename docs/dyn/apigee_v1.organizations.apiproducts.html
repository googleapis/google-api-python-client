Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the organization in which the API product will be created. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}` (required)

The proxy path suffix is defined as the URI fragment following the ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, if the `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the base path defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only requests to `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product. You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following wildcard: - `/**`: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - `/*` : Indicates that only URIs one level down are included. By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the base path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the base path of the API proxy is `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product supports requests to `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such as `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`, and so on.

  <pre>Deletes an API product from an organization. Deleting an API product causes app requests to the resource URIs defined in the API product to fail. Ensure that you create a new API product to serve existing apps, unless your intention is to disable access to the resources defined in the API product. The API product name required in the request URL is the internal name of the product, not the display name. While they may be the same, it depends on whether the API product was created via the UI or the API. View the list of API products to verify the internal name.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the API product. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}/apiproducts/{apiproduct}` (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following wildcard: - `/**`: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - `/*` : Indicates that only URIs one level down are included.

  <pre>Lists all API product names for an organization. Filter the list by passing an `attributename` and `attibutevalue`. The maximum number of API products returned is 1000. You can paginate the list of API products returned using the `startKey` and `count` query parameters.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the organization. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}` (required)
  attributename: string, Name of the attribute used to filter the search.
  attributevalue: string, Value of the attribute used to filter the search.
  count: string, Enter the number of API products you want returned in the API call. The limit is 1000.
  expand: boolean, Flag that specifies whether to expand the results. Set to `true` to get expanded details about each API.
  startKey: string, Gets a list of API products starting with a specific API product in the list. For example, if you&#x27;re returning 50 API products at a time (using the `count` query parameter), you can view products 50-99 by entering the name of the 50th API product in the first API (without using `startKey`). Product name is case sensitive.

For example, if the `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the base path defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only requests to `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product. You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following wildcard: - `/**`: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - `/*` : Indicates that only URIs one level down are included. By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the base path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the base path of the API proxy is `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product supports requests to `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such as `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`, and so on.
