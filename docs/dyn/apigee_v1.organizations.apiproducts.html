  <pre>Updates an existing API product. You must include all required values, whether or not you are updating them, as well as any optional values that you are updating. The API product name required in the request URL is the internal name of the product, not the Display Name. While they may be the same, it depends on whether the API product was created via UI or API. View the list of API products to identify their internal names.

Args:
  name: string, **Required.** API product name in the following form: organizations/organization_ID/apiproducts/api_product_name  (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

If set to `manual`, the consumer key is generated and returned in &quot;pending&quot; state. In this case, the API keys won&#x27;t work until they have been explicitly approved. If set to `auto`, the consumer key is generated and returned in &quot;approved&quot; state and can be used immediately. *NOTE:* Typically, `auto` is used to provide access to free or trial API products that provide limited quota or capabilities.
    &quot;apiResources&quot;: [ # Comma-separated list of API resources to be bundled in the API Product. By default, the resource paths are mapped from the `proxy.pathsuffix` variable. The proxy path suffix is defined as the URI fragment following the ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, if the `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the base path defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only requests to `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product. You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following wildcard: - /**: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - /* : Indicates that only URIs one level down are included. By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the base path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the base path of the API proxy is `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product supports requests to `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such as `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`, and so on.
