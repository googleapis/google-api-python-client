  <pre>Creates an API product in an organization.
You create API products after
you have proxied backend services using API proxies.
An API product is a
collection of API resources combined with quota settings and metadata that
you can use to deliver customized and productized API bundles to your
developer community. This metadata can include:

- Scope
- Environments
- API proxies
- Extensible profile

API products enable you repackage APIs
on-the-fly, without having to do any additional coding or configuration.
Apigee recommends that you start with a simple API product including only
required elements. You then provision credentials to apps to enable them to
start testing your APIs.

After you have authentication and authorization
working against a simple API product, you can iterate to create finer
grained API products, defining different sets of API resources for each API
product.

&lt;aside class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt;

- If you don&#x27;t specify an API proxy in the request body, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; app
associated with the product can make calls to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; API in your
entire organization.
- If you don&#x27;t specify an environment in the request body, the product
allows access to all environments.

&lt;/aside&gt;

be created. Must be in the following form:

  <pre>Deletes an API product from an organization.

Deleting an API product
causes app requests to the resource URIs defined in the API product to
fail.

Ensure that you create a new API product to serve existing apps, unless

product.

The API product name required in the request URL is the internal name of
the product, not the display name. While they may be the same, it depends
on whether the API product was created via the UI or the API. View the list
of API products to verify the internal name.

  <pre>Updates an existing API product. You must include all required values,
whether or not you are updating them, as well as any optional values that
you are updating.

The API product name required in the request URL is the
internal name of the product, not the Display Name. While they may be the
same, it depends on whether the API product was created via UI or API. View
the list of API products to identify their internal names.

Args:
  name: string, **Required.** API product name in the following form:
&lt;pre&gt;organizations/&lt;var&gt;organization_ID&lt;/var&gt;/apiproducts/&lt;var&gt;api_product_name&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
