  <pre>Updates an existing API product. You must include all required values, whether or not you are updating them, as well as any optional values that you are updating. The API product name required in the request URL is the internal name of the product, not the Display Name. While they may be the same, it depends on whether the API product was created via UI or API. View the list of API products to identify their internal names.

Args:
  name: string, **Required.** API product name in the following form: organizations/organization_ID/apiproducts/api_product_name  (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;environments&quot;: [ # A comma-separated list of environment names to which the API product is bound. Requests to environments that are not listed are rejected. By specifying one or more environments, you can bind the resources listed in the API product to a specific environment, preventing developers from accessing those resources through API proxies deployed in another environment. This setting is used, for example, to prevent resources associated with API proxies in &#x27;prod&#x27; from being accessed by API proxies deployed in &#x27;test&#x27;.
    &quot;A String&quot;,

For example, a `quota` of 50, for a `quotaInterval` of 12 and a `quotaTimeUnit` of hours means 50 requests are allowed every 12 hours.

Remote services are non-Apigee Edge proxies. eg, Istio-Envoy. # The operation_group enables api product creators to group Apigee proxies or remote services with resources, method types and quotas. The resource refers to the resource URI(excluding the base path). With this grouping, API product creator is able to finetune and give precise control over which REST methods have access to which resources, and how many such calls can be made (via Quota). Note that api_resources cannot be specified at both the API product level as well as within the operation_group. If configured that way, the call will fail. Please refer go/api-product-with-methods for additional details.

If set to `auto`, the consumer key is generated and returned in &quot;approved&quot; state and can be used immediately. *NOTE:* Typically, `auto` is used to provide access to free or trial API products that provide limited quota or capabilities.
  &quot;attributes&quot;: [ # Array of attributes that may be used to extend the default API product profile with customer-specific metadata. You can specify a maximum of 18 attributes. Use this property to specify the access level of the API product as either `public`, `private`, or `internal`. Only products marked `public` are available to developers in the Apigee developer portal. For example, you can set a product to `internal` while it is in development and then change access to `public` when it is ready to release on the portal. API products marked as `private` do not appear on the portal but can be accessed by external developers. For monetization, you can use the attributes field to: - Specify transaction success criteria - Specify custom attributes on which you base rate plan charges.

  &quot;apiResources&quot;: [ # Comma-separated list of API resources to be bundled in the API Product. By default, the resource paths are mapped from the `proxy.pathsuffix` variable. The proxy path suffix is defined as the URI fragment following the ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, if the `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the base path defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only requests to `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product. You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following wildcard: - /**: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - /* : Indicates that only URIs one level down are included. By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the base path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the base path of the API proxy is `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product supports requests to `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such as `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`, and so on.
