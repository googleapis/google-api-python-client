  <pre>Creates an API product in an organization.
You create API products after
you have proxied backend services using API proxies.
An API product is a
collection of API resources combined with quota settings and metadata that
you can use to deliver customized and productized API bundles to your
developer community. This metadata can include:

- Scope
- Environments
- API proxies
- Extensible profile

API products enable you repackage APIs
on-the-fly, without having to do any additional coding or configuration.
Apigee recommends that you start with a simple API product including only
required elements. You then provision credentials to apps to enable them to
start testing your APIs.

After you have authentication and authorization
working against a simple API product, you can iterate to create finer
grained API products, defining different sets of API resources for each API
product.

&lt;aside class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt;

- If you don&#x27;t specify an API proxy in the request body, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; app
associated with the product can make calls to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; API in your
entire organization.
- If you don&#x27;t specify an environment in the request body, the product
allows access to all environments.

&lt;/aside&gt;

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent organization name under which the API product will
be created. Must be in the following form:
&lt;pre&gt;organizations/&lt;var&gt;organization_ID&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

Deleting an API product
causes app requests to the resource URIs defined in the API product to

Ensure that you create a new API product to serve existing apps, unless

product.

The API product name required in the request URL is the internal name of
the product, not the display name. While they may be the same, it depends
on whether the API product was created via the UI or the API. View the list
of API products to verify the internal name.

The API product name required in the request URL is the

the list of API products to identify their internal names.
