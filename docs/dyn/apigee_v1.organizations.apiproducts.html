If set to `manual`, the consumer key is generated and returned in &quot;pending&quot; state. In this case, the API keys won&#x27;t work until they have been explicitly approved. If set to `auto`, the consumer key is generated and returned in &quot;approved&quot; state and can be used immediately. **Note:** Typically, `auto` is used to provide access to free or trial API products that provide limited quota or capabilities.
  &quot;attributes&quot;: [ # Array of attributes that may be used to extend the default API product profile with customer-specific metadata. You can specify a maximum of 18 attributes. Use this property to specify the access level of the API product as either `public`, `private`, or `internal`. Only products marked `public` are available to developers in the Apigee developer portal. For example, you can set a product to `internal` while it is in development and then change access to `public` when it is ready to release on the portal. API products marked as `private` do not appear on the portal, but can be accessed by external developers.

For example, if the `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the base path defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only requests to `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product. You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following wildcard: - `/**`: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - `/*` : Indicates that only URIs one level down are included. By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the base path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the base path of the API proxy is `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product supports requests to `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such as `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`, and so on.

  <pre>Deletes an API product from an organization. Deleting an API product causes app requests to the resource URIs defined in the API product to fail. Ensure that you create a new API product to serve existing apps, unless your intention is to disable access to the resources defined in the API product. The API product name required in the request URL is the internal name of the product, not the display name. While they may be the same, it depends on whether the API product was created via the UI or the API. View the list of API products to verify the internal name.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the API product. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}/apiproducts/{apiproduct}` (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, attributename=None, attributevalue=None, count=None, expand=None, startKey=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all API product names for an organization. Filter the list by passing an `attributename` and `attibutevalue`. The limit on the number of API products returned by the API is 1000. You can paginate the list of API products returned using the `startKey` and `count` query parameters.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the organization. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}` (required)
  attributename: string, Name of the attribute used to filter the search.
  attributevalue: string, Value of the attribute used to filter the search.
  count: string, Enter the number of API products you want returned in the API call. The limit is 1000.
  expand: boolean, Flag that specifies whether to expand the results. Set to `true` to get expanded details about each API.
  startKey: string, Gets a list of API products starting with a specific API product in the list. For example, if you&#x27;re returning 50 API products at a time (using the `count` query parameter), you can view products 50-99 by entering the name of the 50th API product in the first API (without using `startKey`). Product name is case sensitive.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

If set to `manual`, the consumer key is generated and returned in &quot;pending&quot; state. In this case, the API keys won&#x27;t work until they have been explicitly approved. If set to `auto`, the consumer key is generated and returned in &quot;approved&quot; state and can be used immediately. **Note:** Typically, `auto` is used to provide access to free or trial API products that provide limited quota or capabilities.
  &quot;attributes&quot;: [ # Array of attributes that may be used to extend the default API product profile with customer-specific metadata. You can specify a maximum of 18 attributes. Use this property to specify the access level of the API product as either `public`, `private`, or `internal`. Only products marked `public` are available to developers in the Apigee developer portal. For example, you can set a product to `internal` while it is in development and then change access to `public` when it is ready to release on the portal. API products marked as `private` do not appear on the portal, but can be accessed by external developers.

Comma-separated list of API resources to be bundled in the API product. By default, the resource paths are mapped from the `proxy.pathsuffix` variable. The proxy path suffix is defined as the URI fragment following the ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, if the `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the base path defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only requests to `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product. You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following wildcard: - `/**`: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - `/*` : Indicates that only URIs one level down are included. By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the base path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the base path of the API proxy is `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product supports requests to `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such as `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`, and so on.

By specifying one or more environments, you can bind the resources listed in the API product to a specific environment, preventing developers from accessing those resources through API proxies deployed in another environment. This setting is used, for example, to prevent resources associated with API proxies in `prod` from being accessed by API proxies deployed in `test`.
