  <pre>Generates and returns a summary for a conversation that does not have a resource created for it.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource to charge for the Summary&#x27;s generation. Format: `projects//locations/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for Conversations.GenerateStatelessSummary.
  &quot;conversationProfile&quot;: { # Defines the services to connect to incoming Dialogflow conversations. # Required. A ConversationProfile containing information required for Summary generation. Required fields: {language_code, security_settings} Optional fields: {agent_assistant_config}
    &quot;automatedAgentConfig&quot;: { # Defines the Automated Agent to connect to a conversation. # Configuration for an automated agent to use with this profile.
      &quot;agent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. ID of the Dialogflow agent environment to use. This project needs to either be the same project as the conversation or you need to grant `service-@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com` the `Dialogflow API Service Agent` role in this project. - For ES agents, use format: `projects//locations//agent/environments/`. If environment is not specified, the default `draft` environment is used. Refer to [DetectIntentRequest](/dialogflow/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.dialogflow.v2#google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.DetectIntentRequest) for more details. - For CX agents, use format `projects//locations//agents//environments/`. If environment is not specified, the default `draft` environment is used.
      &quot;sessionTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Sets Dialogflow CX session life time. By default, a Dialogflow CX session remains active and its data is stored for 30 minutes after the last request is sent for the session. This value should be no longer than 1 day.
