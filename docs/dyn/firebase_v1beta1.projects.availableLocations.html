  <pre>**DECOMMISSIONED.** **If called, this endpoint will return a 404 error.** _Instead, use the applicable resource-specific REST API (or associated documentation, as needed) to determine valid locations for each resource used in your Project._ Lists the valid [&quot;locations for default Google Cloud resources&quot;](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations#default-cloud-location) for the specified Project (including a FirebaseProject). One of these locations can be selected as the Project&#x27;s location for default Google Cloud resources, which is the geographical location where the Project&#x27;s resources associated with Google App Engine (such as the default Cloud Firestore instance) will be provisioned by default. However, if the location for default Google Cloud resources has already been set for the Project, then this setting cannot be changed.

To list all locations (regardless of any restrictions), call the endpoint without specifying a unique project identifier (that is, `/v1beta1/{parent=projects/-}/listAvailableLocations`). To call `ListAvailableLocations` with a specified project, a member must be at minimum a Viewer of the Project. Calls without a specified project do not require any specific project permissions.

Args:
  parent: string, The FirebaseProject for which to list [locations for default Google Cloud resources](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations#default-cloud-location), in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER Refer to the `FirebaseProject` [`name`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.name) field for details about PROJECT_IDENTIFIER values. If no unique project identifier is specified (that is, `projects/-`), the returned list does not take into account org-specific or project-specific location restrictions. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of locations to return in the response. The server may return fewer than this value at its discretion. If no value is specified (or too large a value is specified), then the server will impose its own limit. This value cannot be negative.
  pageToken: string, Token returned from a previous call to `ListAvailableLocations` indicating where in the list of locations to resume listing.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
  &quot;locations&quot;: [ # One page of results from a call to `ListAvailableLocations`.
    { # **DEPRECATED.** _This Location is no longer used to determine Firebase resource locations. Instead, consult product documentation to determine valid locations for each resource used in your Project._ A [&quot;location for default Google Cloud resources&quot;](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations#default-cloud-location) that can be selected for a FirebaseProject. These are resources associated with Google App Engine.
      &quot;features&quot;: [ # Products and services that are available in the location for default Google Cloud resources.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;locationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID of the Project&#x27;s location for default Google Cloud resources. It will be one of the available [Google App Engine locations](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#region).
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Indicates whether the location for default Google Cloud resources is a [regional or multi-regional location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations#types) for data replication.
    },
  ],
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If the result list is too large to fit in a single response, then a token is returned. If the string is empty, then this response is the last page of results and all available locations have been listed. This token can be used in a subsequent call to `ListAvailableLocations` to find more locations. Page tokens are short-lived and should not be persisted.

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
