  <pre>Updates the defined Memcached parameters for an existing instance. This method only stages the parameters, it must be followed by `ApplyParameters` to apply the parameters to nodes of the Memcached instance.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Resource name of the Memcached instance for which the parameters should be updated. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for UpdateParameters.
  &quot;parameters&quot;: { # The parameters to apply to the instance.
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique ID associated with this set of parameters. Users can use this id to determine if the parameters associated with the instance differ from the parameters associated with the nodes. A discrepancy between parameter ids can inform users that they may need to take action to apply parameters on nodes.
    &quot;params&quot;: { # User defined set of parameters to use in the memcached process.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
  },
  &quot;updateMask&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Mask of fields to update.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
