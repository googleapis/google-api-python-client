  <pre>Rpc to get information about a configuration.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the configuration being retrieved. If needed, replace {namespace_id} with the project ID. (required)

Returns:

For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod.
