Note that Operations working on this Index may have their Operations.metadata.generic_metadata.update_time a little after the value of this timestamp, yet that does not mean their results are not already reflected in the Index. Result of any successfully completed Operation on the Index is reflected in it.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
