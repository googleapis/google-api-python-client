<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="beginTransaction">beginTransaction(session, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Begins a new transaction. This step can often be skipped:
Read, ExecuteSql and
Commit can begin a new transaction as a
side-effect.

Args:
  session: string, Required. The session in which the transaction runs. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for BeginTransaction.
    "options": { # # Transactions # Required. Options for the new transaction.
        #
        #
        # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
        # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
        # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
        # new session for each transaction.
        #
        # # Transaction Modes
        #
        # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
        #
        #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
        #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
        #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
        #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
        #      application to retry.
        #
        #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
        #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
        #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
        #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
        #      transactions do not need to be committed.
        #
        # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
        # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
        # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
        # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
        # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
        #
        # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
        # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
        # database.
        #
        # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
        #
        # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
        # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
        # consistent.
        #
        # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
        # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
        # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
        # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
        # transaction has not been terminated by
        # Commit or
        # Rollback.  Long periods of
        # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
        # transaction's locks and abort it.
        #
        # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
        # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
        # have been completed.
        # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
        # reads or SQL queries followed by
        # Commit. At any time before
        # Commit, the client can send a
        # Rollback request to abort the
        # transaction.
        #
        # ### Semantics
        #
        # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
        # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
        # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
        # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
        # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
        #
        # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
        # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
        # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
        # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
        #
        # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
        #
        # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
        # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
        # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
        # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
        # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
        # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
        #
        # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
        # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
        # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
        # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
        # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
        # retrying.
        #
        # ### Idle Transactions
        #
        # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
        # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
        # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
        # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
        # fail with error `ABORTED`.
        #
        # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
        # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
        # transaction from becoming idle.
        #
        # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
        #
        # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
        # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
        # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
        #
        # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
        # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
        # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
        # concurrent read-write transactions.
        #
        # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
        # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
        # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
        # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
        # need to worry about this in practice.
        #
        # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
        # Commit or
        # Rollback (and in fact are not
        # permitted to do so).
        #
        # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
        # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
        #
        # The types of timestamp bound are:
        #
        #   - Strong (the default).
        #   - Bounded staleness.
        #   - Exact staleness.
        #
        # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
        # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
        # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
        # from the leader replica.
        #
        # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
        #
        # ### Strong
        #
        # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
        # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
        # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
        # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction.
        #
        # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
        # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
        # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
        # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
        # timestamp.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
        #
        # ### Exact Staleness
        #
        # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
        # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
        # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
        # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
        # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
        # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
        # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
        # <= the read timestamp have finished.
        #
        # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
        # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
        #
        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
        # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
        # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
        # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
        #
        # ### Bounded Staleness
        #
        # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
        # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
        # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
        # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
        #
        # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
        # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
        # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
        # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
        #
        # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
        # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
        # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
        # timestamp.
        #
        # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
        # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
        # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
        #
        # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
        # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
        # read-only transactions.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
        #
        # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
        #
        # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
        # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
        # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
        # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
        # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
        # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
        # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
        # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

  <pre>Commits a transaction. The request includes the mutations to be
applied to rows in the database.

`Commit` might return an `ABORTED` error. This can occur at any time;
commonly, the cause is conflicts with concurrent
transactions. However, it can also happen for a variety of other
reasons. If `Commit` returns `ABORTED`, the caller should re-attempt
the transaction from the beginning, re-using the same session.

        # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
        # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
        # new session for each transaction.
        #
        # # Transaction Modes
        #
        # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
        #
        #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
        #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
        #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
        #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
        #      application to retry.
        #
        #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
        #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
        #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
        #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
        #      transactions do not need to be committed.
        #
        # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
        # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
        # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
        # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
        # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
        #
        # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
        # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
        # database.
        #
        # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
        #
        # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
        # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
        # consistent.
        #
        # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
        # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
        # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
        # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
        # transaction has not been terminated by
        # Commit or
        # Rollback.  Long periods of
        # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
        # transaction's locks and abort it.
        #
        # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
        # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
        # have been completed.
        # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
        # reads or SQL queries followed by
        # Commit. At any time before
        # Commit, the client can send a
        # Rollback request to abort the
        # transaction.
        #
        # ### Semantics
        #
        # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
        # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
        # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
        # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
        # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
        #
        # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
        # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
        # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
        # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
        #
        # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
        #
        # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
        # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
        # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
        # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
        # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
        # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
        #
        # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
        # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
        # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
        # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
        # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
        # retrying.
        #
        # ### Idle Transactions
        #
        # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
        # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
        # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
        # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
        # fail with error `ABORTED`.
        #
        # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
        # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
        # transaction from becoming idle.
        #
        # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
        #
        # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
        # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
        # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
        #
        # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
        # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
        # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
        # concurrent read-write transactions.
        #
        # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
        # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
        # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
        # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
        # need to worry about this in practice.
        #
        # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
        # Commit or
        # Rollback (and in fact are not
        # permitted to do so).
        #
        # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
        # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
        #
        # The types of timestamp bound are:
        #
        #   - Strong (the default).
        #   - Bounded staleness.
        #   - Exact staleness.
        #
        # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
        # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
        # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
        # from the leader replica.
        #
        # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
        #
        # ### Strong
        #
        # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
        # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
        # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
        # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction.
        #
        # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
        # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
        # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
        # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
        # timestamp.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
        #
        # ### Exact Staleness
        #
        # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
        # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
        # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
        # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
        # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
        # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
        # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
        # <= the read timestamp have finished.
        #
        # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
        # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
        #
        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
        # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
        # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
        # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
        #
        # ### Bounded Staleness
        #
        # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
        # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
        # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
        # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
        #
        # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
        # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
        # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
        # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
        #
        # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
        # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
        # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
        # timestamp.
        #
        # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
        # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
        # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
        #
        # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
        # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
        # read-only transactions.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
        #
        # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
        #
        # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
        # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
        # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
        # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
        # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
        # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
        # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
        # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response for Commit.
    "commitTimestamp": "A String", # The Cloud Spanner timestamp at which the transaction committed.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(database, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new session. A session can be used to perform
transactions that read and/or modify data in a Cloud Spanner database.
Sessions are meant to be reused for many consecutive
transactions.

Sessions can only execute one transaction at a time. To execute
multiple concurrent read-write/write-only transactions, create
multiple sessions. Note that standalone reads and queries use a
transaction internally, and count toward the one transaction
limit.

Cloud Spanner limits the number of sessions that can exist at any given
time; thus, it is a good idea to delete idle and/or unneeded sessions.
Aside from explicit deletes, Cloud Spanner can delete sessions for which no
operations are sent for more than an hour. If a session is deleted,
requests to it return `NOT_FOUND`.

Idle sessions can be kept alive by sending a trivial SQL query
periodically, e.g., `"SELECT 1"`.

Args:
  database: string, Required. The database in which the new session is created. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A session in the Cloud Spanner API.
    "name": "A String", # Required. The name of the session.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Ends a session, releasing server resources associated with it.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the session to delete. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="executeSql">executeSql(session, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Executes an SQL query, returning all rows in a single reply. This
method cannot be used to return a result set larger than 10 MiB;
if the query yields more data than that, the query fails with
a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error.

Queries inside read-write transactions might return `ABORTED`. If
this occurs, the application should restart the transaction from
the beginning. See Transaction for more details.

Larger result sets can be fetched in streaming fashion by calling
ExecuteStreamingSql instead.

Args:
  session: string, Required. The session in which the SQL query should be performed. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for ExecuteSql and
      # ExecuteStreamingSql.
    "transaction": { # This message is used to select the transaction in which a # The transaction to use. If none is provided, the default is a
        # temporary read-only transaction with strong concurrency.
        # Read or
        # ExecuteSql call runs.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions for more information about transactions.
      "begin": { # # Transactions # Begin a new transaction and execute this read or SQL query in
          # it. The transaction ID of the new transaction is returned in
          # ResultSetMetadata.transaction, which is a Transaction.
          #
          #
          # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
          # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
          # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
          # new session for each transaction.
          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
          # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
          # have been completed.
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL queries followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # <= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose

          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
          # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
          # have been completed.
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL queries followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # <= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
          # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
          # have been completed.
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL queries followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # <= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
        "readWrite": { # Options for read-write transactions. # Transaction may write.

          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
          # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
          # have been completed.
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL queries followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # <= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

        # meaning that the rest of the value is sent in subsequent
        # `PartialResultSet`(s). This is denoted by the chunked_value
        # field. Two or more chunked values can be merged to form a
        # complete value as follows:
        #
        #   * `bool/number/null`: cannot be chunked
        #   * `string`: concatenate the strings
        #   * `list`: concatenate the lists. If the last element in a list is a
        #     `string`, `list`, or `object`, merge it with the first element in
        #     the next list by applying these rules recursively.
        #   * `object`: concatenate the (field name, field value) pairs. If a
        #     field name is duplicated, then apply these rules recursively
        #     to merge the field values.
        #
        # Some examples of merging:
        #
        #     # Strings are concatenated.
        #     "foo", "bar" => "foobar"
        #
        #     # Lists of non-strings are concatenated.
        #     [2, 3], [4] => [2, 3, 4]
        #
        #     # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
        #     # because they are strings.
        #     ["a", "b"], ["c", "d"] => ["a", "bc", "d"]
        #
        #     # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
        #     # because they are lists. Recursively, the last and first elements
        #     # of the inner lists are merged because they are strings.
        #     ["a", ["b", "c"]], [["d"], "e"] => ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"]
        #
        #     # Non-overlapping object fields are combined.
        #     {"a": "1"}, {"b": "2"} => {"a": "1", "b": 2"}
        #
        #     # Overlapping object fields are merged.
        #     {"a": "1"}, {"a": "2"} => {"a": "12"}
        #

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a session. Returns `NOT_FOUND` if the session does not exist.
This is mainly useful for determining whether a session is still
alive.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the session to retrieve. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A session in the Cloud Spanner API.
    "name": "A String", # Required. The name of the session.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="read">read(session, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Reads rows from the database using key lookups and scans, as a
simple key/value style alternative to
ExecuteSql.  This method cannot be used to
return a result set larger than 10 MiB; if the read matches more
data than that, the read fails with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
error.

Reads inside read-write transactions might return `ABORTED`. If
this occurs, the application should restart the transaction from
the beginning. See Transaction for more details.

Larger result sets can be yielded in streaming fashion by calling
StreamingRead instead.

Args:
  session: string, Required. The session in which the read should be performed. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for Read and
      # StreamingRead.
    "index": "A String", # If non-empty, the name of an index on table. This index is
        # used instead of the table primary key when interpreting key_set
        # and sorting result rows. See key_set for further information.

        # temporary read-only transaction with strong concurrency.
        # Read or
        # ExecuteSql call runs.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions for more information about transactions.
      "begin": { # # Transactions # Begin a new transaction and execute this read or SQL query in
          # it. The transaction ID of the new transaction is returned in
          # ResultSetMetadata.transaction, which is a Transaction.
          #
          #
          # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
          # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
          # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
          # new session for each transaction.
          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
          # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
          # have been completed.
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL queries followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # <= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

          #
          # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
          # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
          # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
          # new session for each transaction.
          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
          # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
          # have been completed.
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL queries followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # <= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,

          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution

          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated

            # provided components are included; if the key is open, then rows
            # that exactly match are not included.
            #

          # it. The transaction ID of the new transaction is returned in
          # ResultSetMetadata.transaction, which is a Transaction.

          #
          # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
          # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be

          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports two transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
          # being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads
          # have been completed.
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL queries followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # <= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they

          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp <=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # <= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

      "ranges": [ # A list of key ranges. See KeyRange for more information about

            # A range has a start key and an end key. These keys can be open or
            # closed, indicating if the range includes rows with that key.
            #
            # Keys are represented by lists, where the ith value in the list
            # corresponds to the ith component of the table or index primary key.
            # Individual values are encoded as described here.
            #
            # For example, consider the following table definition:
            #
            #     CREATE TABLE UserEvents (
            #       UserName STRING(MAX),
            #       EventDate STRING(10)
            #     ) PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate);
            #
            # The following keys name rows in this table:
            #
            #     "Bob", "2014-09-23"
            #
            # Since the `UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY KEY` clause names two
            # columns, each `UserEvents` key has two elements; the first is the
            # `UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`.
            #
            # Key ranges with multiple components are interpreted
            # lexicographically by component using the table or index key's declared
            # sort order. For example, the following range returns all events for

            # that exactly match are not included.
