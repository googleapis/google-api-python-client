<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchCreate">batchCreate(database, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates multiple new sessions.

This API can be used to initialize a session cache on the clients.
See https://goo.gl/TgSFN2 for best practices on session cache management.

Args:
  database: string, Required. The database in which the new sessions are created. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

      "labels": { # The labels for the session.
          #
          #  * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
          #    the following regular expression: `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`.
          #  * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
          #    to the regular expression `([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?`.
          #  * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given session.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="beginTransaction">beginTransaction(session, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Begins a new transaction. This step can often be skipped:
Read, ExecuteSql and
Commit can begin a new transaction as a
side-effect.

Args:
  session: string, Required. The session in which the transaction runs. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for BeginTransaction.
    "options": { # # Transactions # Required. Options for the new transaction.
        #
        #
        # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
        # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
        # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
        # new session for each transaction.
        #
        # # Transaction Modes
        #
        # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
        #
        #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
        #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
        #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
        #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
        #      application to retry.
        #
        #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
        #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
        #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
        #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
        #      transactions do not need to be committed.
        #
        #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
        #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
        #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
        #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
        #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
        #      committed.
        #
        # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
        # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
        # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
        # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
        # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
        #
        # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
        # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
        # database.
        #
        # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
        #
        # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
        # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
        # consistent.
        #
        # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
        # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
        # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
        # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
        # transaction has not been terminated by
        # Commit or
        # Rollback.  Long periods of
        # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
        # transaction's locks and abort it.
        #
        # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
        # reads or SQL statements followed by
        # Commit. At any time before
        # Commit, the client can send a
        # Rollback request to abort the
        # transaction.
        #
        # ### Semantics
        #
        # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
        # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
        # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
        # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
        # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
        #
        # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
        # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
        # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
        # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
        #
        # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
        #
        # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
        # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
        # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
        # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
        # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
        # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
        #
        # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
        # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
        # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
        # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
        # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
        # retrying.
        #
        # ### Idle Transactions
        #
        # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
        # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
        # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
        # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
        # fail with error `ABORTED`.
        #
        # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
        # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
        # transaction from becoming idle.
        #
        # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
        #
        # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
        # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
        # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
        #
        # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
        # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
        # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
        # concurrent read-write transactions.
        #
        # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
        # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
        # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
        # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
        # need to worry about this in practice.
        #
        # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
        # Commit or
        # Rollback (and in fact are not
        # permitted to do so).
        #
        # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
        # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
        #
        # The types of timestamp bound are:
        #
        #   - Strong (the default).
        #   - Bounded staleness.
        #   - Exact staleness.
        #
        # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
        # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
        # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
        # from the leader replica.
        #
        # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
        #
        # ### Strong
        #
        # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
        # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
        # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
        # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction.
        #
        # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
        # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
        # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
        # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
        # timestamp.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
        #
        # ### Exact Staleness
        #
        # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
        # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
        # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
        # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
        # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
        # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
        # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
        # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
        #
        # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
        # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
        #
        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
        # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
        # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
        # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
        #
        # ### Bounded Staleness
        #
        # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
        # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
        # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
        # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
        #
        # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
        # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
        # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
        # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
        #
        # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
        # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
        # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
        # timestamp.
        #
        # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
        # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
        # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
        #
        # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
        # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
        # read-only transactions.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
        #
        # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
        #
        # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
        # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
        # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
        # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
        # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
        # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
        # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
        # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
        #
        # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
        #
        # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
        # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
        # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
        # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
        # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
        #
        # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
        # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
        # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
        #
        # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
        # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
        # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
        #
        # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
        # in ReadWrite transactions.
        #
        #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
        #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
        #    a single row of the table.
        #
        #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
        #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
        #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
        #    with the base table rows.
        #
        #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
        #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
        #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
        #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
        #    dangerous to run a statement such as
        #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
        #    against some rows.
        #
        #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
        #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
        #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
        #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
        #    never executed against other rows.
        #
        #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
        #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
        #
        #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML

  <pre>Commits a transaction. The request includes the mutations to be
applied to rows in the database.

`Commit` might return an `ABORTED` error. This can occur at any time;
commonly, the cause is conflicts with concurrent
transactions. However, it can also happen for a variety of other
reasons. If `Commit` returns `ABORTED`, the caller should re-attempt
the transaction from the beginning, re-using the same session.

Args:
  session: string, Required. The session in which the transaction to be committed is running. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

        # instance, due to retries in the application, or in the
        # transport library), it is possible that the mutations are
        # executed more than once. If this is undesirable, use
        # BeginTransaction and
        # Commit instead.
        #

        # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
        # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
        # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
        # new session for each transaction.
        #
        # # Transaction Modes
        #
        # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
        #
        #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
        #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
        #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
        #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
        #      application to retry.
        #
        #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
        #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
        #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
        #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
        #      transactions do not need to be committed.
        #
        #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
        #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
        #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
        #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
        #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
        #      committed.
        #
        # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
        # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
        # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
        # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
        # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
        #
        # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
        # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
        # database.
        #
        # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
        #
        # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
        # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
        # consistent.
        #
        # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
        # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
        # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
        # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
        # transaction has not been terminated by
        # Commit or
        # Rollback.  Long periods of
        # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
        # transaction's locks and abort it.
        #
        # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
        # reads or SQL statements followed by
        # Commit. At any time before
        # Commit, the client can send a
        # Rollback request to abort the
        # transaction.
        #
        # ### Semantics
        #
        # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
        # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
        # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
        # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
        # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
        #
        # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
        # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
        # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
        # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
        #
        # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
        #
        # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
        # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
        # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
        # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
        # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
        # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
        #
        # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
        # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
        # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
        # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
        # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
        # retrying.
        #
        # ### Idle Transactions
        #
        # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
        # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
        # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
        # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
        # fail with error `ABORTED`.
        #
        # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
        # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
        # transaction from becoming idle.
        #
        # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
        #
        # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
        # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
        # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
        #
        # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
        # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
        # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
        # concurrent read-write transactions.
        #
        # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
        # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
        # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
        # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
        # need to worry about this in practice.
        #
        # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
        # Commit or
        # Rollback (and in fact are not
        # permitted to do so).
        #
        # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
        # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
        #
        # The types of timestamp bound are:
        #
        #   - Strong (the default).
        #   - Bounded staleness.
        #   - Exact staleness.
        #
        # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
        # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
        # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
        # from the leader replica.
        #
        # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
        #
        # ### Strong
        #
        # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
        # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
        # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
        # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
        # see the transaction.
        #
        # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
        # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
        # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
        # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
        # timestamp.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
        #
        # ### Exact Staleness
        #
        # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
        # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
        # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
        # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
        # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
        # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
        # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
        # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
        #
        # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
        # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
        #
        # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
        # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
        # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
        # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
        #
        # ### Bounded Staleness
        #
        # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
        # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
        # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
        # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
        #
        # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
        # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
        # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
        # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
        # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
        #
        # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
        # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
        # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
        # timestamp.
        #
        # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
        # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
        # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
        # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
        #
        # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
        # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
        # read-only transactions.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
        # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
        #
        # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
        #
        # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
        # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
        # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
        # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
        # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
        # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
        # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
        # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
        #
        # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
        #
        # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
        # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
        # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
        # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
        # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
        #
        # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
        # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
        # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
        #
        # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
        # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
        # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
        #
        # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
        # in ReadWrite transactions.
        #
        #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
        #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
        #    a single row of the table.
        #
        #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
        #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
        #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
        #    with the base table rows.
        #
        #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
        #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
        #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
        #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
        #    dangerous to run a statement such as
        #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
        #    against some rows.
        #
        #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
        #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
        #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
        #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
        #    never executed against other rows.
        #
        #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
        #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
        #
        #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
        #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
        #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
        #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
        #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
        #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
        #
        # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
        # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
        # table.

    <code class="details" id="create">create(database, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new session. A session can be used to perform
transactions that read and/or modify data in a Cloud Spanner database.
Sessions are meant to be reused for many consecutive
transactions.

Sessions can only execute one transaction at a time. To execute
multiple concurrent read-write/write-only transactions, create
multiple sessions. Note that standalone reads and queries use a
transaction internally, and count toward the one transaction
limit.

Active sessions use additional server resources, so it is a good idea to
delete idle and unneeded sessions.
Aside from explicit deletes, Cloud Spanner may delete sessions for which no
operations are sent for more than an hour. If a session is deleted,
requests to it return `NOT_FOUND`.

Idle sessions can be kept alive by sending a trivial SQL query
periodically, e.g., `"SELECT 1"`.

Args:
  database: string, Required. The database in which the new session is created. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for CreateSession.
    "session": { # A session in the Cloud Spanner API. # The session to create.
      "labels": { # The labels for the session.
          #

          # new session for each transaction.
          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

        #
        # See TransactionOptions for more information about transactions.
      "begin": { # # Transactions # Begin a new transaction and execute this read or SQL query in
          # it. The transaction ID of the new transaction is returned in
          # ResultSetMetadata.transaction, which is a Transaction.
          #
          #
          # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the

          # new session for each transaction.
          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #

          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.

          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

          # new session for each transaction.
          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="partitionRead">partitionRead(session, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a set of partition tokens that can be used to execute a read
operation in parallel.  Each of the returned partition tokens can be used
by StreamingRead to specify a subset of the read
result to read.  The same session and read-only transaction must be used by
the PartitionReadRequest used to create the partition tokens and the
ReadRequests that use the partition tokens.  There are no ordering
guarantees on rows returned among the returned partition tokens, or even
within each individual StreamingRead call issued with a partition_token.

Partition tokens become invalid when the session used to create them
is deleted, is idle for too long, begins a new transaction, or becomes too
old.  When any of these happen, it is not possible to resume the read, and
the whole operation must be restarted from the beginning.

Args:
  session: string, Required. The session used to create the partitions. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for PartitionRead
    "index": "A String", # If non-empty, the name of an index on table. This index is
        # used instead of the table primary key when interpreting key_set
        # and sorting result rows. See key_set for further information.
    "transaction": { # This message is used to select the transaction in which a # Read only snapshot transactions are supported, read/write and single use
        # transactions are not.
        # Read or
        # ExecuteSql call runs.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions for more information about transactions.
      "begin": { # # Transactions # Begin a new transaction and execute this read or SQL query in
          # it. The transaction ID of the new transaction is returned in
          # ResultSetMetadata.transaction, which is a Transaction.
          #
          #
          # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
          # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
          # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
          # new session for each transaction.
          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

            # Individual values are encoded as described
            # here.
            #
            # For example, consider the following table definition:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="read">read(session, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Reads rows from the database using key lookups and scans, as a
simple key/value style alternative to
ExecuteSql.  This method cannot be used to
return a result set larger than 10 MiB; if the read matches more
data than that, the read fails with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
error.

Reads inside read-write transactions might return `ABORTED`. If
this occurs, the application should restart the transaction from
the beginning. See Transaction for more details.

Larger result sets can be yielded in streaming fashion by calling
StreamingRead instead.

Args:
  session: string, Required. The session in which the read should be performed. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for Read and
      # StreamingRead.
    "index": "A String", # If non-empty, the name of an index on table. This index is
        # used instead of the table primary key when interpreting key_set
        # and sorting result rows. See key_set for further information.
    "transaction": { # This message is used to select the transaction in which a # The transaction to use. If none is provided, the default is a
        # temporary read-only transaction with strong concurrency.
        # Read or
        # ExecuteSql call runs.
        #
        # See TransactionOptions for more information about transactions.
      "begin": { # # Transactions # Begin a new transaction and execute this read or SQL query in
          # it. The transaction ID of the new transaction is returned in
          # ResultSetMetadata.transaction, which is a Transaction.
          #
          #
          # Each session can have at most one active transaction at a time. After the
          # active transaction is completed, the session can immediately be
          # re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to create a
          # new session for each transaction.
          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

          # new session for each transaction.
          #
          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

            # A range has a start key and an end key. These keys can be open or
            # closed, indicating if the range includes rows with that key.

            #     CREATE TABLE UserEvents (
            #       UserName STRING(MAX),

            #     ) PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate);

            #
            #     "Bob", "2014-09-23"
            #
            # Since the `UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY KEY` clause names two
            # columns, each `UserEvents` key has two elements; the first is the
            # `UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`.

            # Key ranges with multiple components are interpreted

            #     "start_closed": ["Bob", "2015-01-01"]

            #
            # Start and end keys can omit trailing key components. This affects the
            # inclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided key
            # components: if the key is closed, then rows that exactly match the
            # provided components are included; if the key is open, then rows
            # that exactly match are not included.
            #
            # For example, the following range includes all events for `"Bob"` that

            #     "end_closed": ["Bob"]

          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

          # # Transaction Modes
          #
          # Cloud Spanner supports three transaction modes:
          #
          #   1. Locking read-write. This type of transaction is the only way
          #      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These transactions rely on
          #      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase commit.
          #      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
          #      application to retry.
          #
          #   2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type provides guaranteed
          #      consistency across several reads, but does not allow
          #      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
          #      read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only
          #      transactions do not need to be committed.
          #
          #   3. Partitioned DML. This type of transaction is used to execute
          #      a single Partitioned DML statement. Partitioned DML partitions
          #      the key space and runs the DML statement over each partition
          #      in parallel using separate, internal transactions that commit
          #      independently. Partitioned DML transactions do not need to be
          #      committed.
          #
          # For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only transactions
          # provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
          # particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do
          # not conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not
          # taking locks, they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.
          #
          # Transactions may only read/write data in a single database. They
          # may, however, read/write data in different tables within that
          # database.
          #
          # ## Locking Read-Write Transactions
          #
          # Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-write
          # data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
          # consistent.
          #
          # Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a transaction
          # is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
          # and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks
          # active as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the
          # transaction has not been terminated by
          # Commit or
          # Rollback.  Long periods of
          # inactivity at the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a
          # transaction's locks and abort it.
          #
          # Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or more
          # reads or SQL statements followed by
          # Commit. At any time before
          # Commit, the client can send a
          # Rollback request to abort the
          # transaction.
          #
          # ### Semantics
          #
          # Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired
          # are still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write
          # locks for all writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any
          # reason. If a commit attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees
          # that the transaction has not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.
          #
          # Unless the transaction commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about
          # how long the transaction's locks were held for. It is an error to
          # use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort of mutual exclusion other than
          # between Cloud Spanner transactions themselves.
          #
          # ### Retrying Aborted Transactions
          #
          # When a transaction aborts, the application can choose to retry the
          # whole transaction again. To maximize the chances of successfully
          # committing the retry, the client should execute the retry in the
          # same session as the original attempt. The original session's lock
          # priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that each
          # attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
          #
          # Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to
          # modify the same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a
          # short period before successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good
          # idea to cap the number of retries a transaction can attempt;
          # instead, it is better to limit the total amount of wall time spent
          # retrying.
          #
          # ### Idle Transactions
          #
          # A transaction is considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or
          # SQL queries and has not started a read or SQL query within the last 10
          # seconds. Idle transactions can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they
          # don't hold on to locks indefinitely. In that case, the commit will
          # fail with error `ABORTED`.
          #
          # If this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple
          # SQL query in the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the
          # transaction from becoming idle.
          #
          # ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions provides a simpler method than
          # locking read-write transactions for doing several consistent
          # reads. However, this type of transaction does not support writes.
          #
          # Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
          # choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
          # timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block
          # concurrent read-write transactions.
          #
          # Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot read-only
          # transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
          # timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage
          # collection policy is generous enough that most applications do not
          # need to worry about this in practice.
          #
          # Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
          # Commit or
          # Rollback (and in fact are not
          # permitted to do so).
          #
          # To execute a snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp
          # bound, which tells Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.
          #
          # The types of timestamp bound are:
          #
          #   - Strong (the default).
          #   - Bounded staleness.
          #   - Exact staleness.
          #
          # If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
          # stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong
          # or read-write transaction, because they are able to execute far
          # from the leader replica.
          #
          # Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.
          #
          # ### Strong
          #
          # Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
          # that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all
          # rows yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if
          # any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read
          # see the transaction.
          #
          # Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
          # transactions might return inconsistent results if there are
          # concurrent writes. If consistency across reads is required, the
          # reads should be executed within a transaction or at an exact read
          # timestamp.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.
          #
          # ### Exact Staleness
          #
          # These timestamp bounds execute reads at a user-specified
          # timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent
          # prefix of the global transaction history: they observe
          # modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp &lt;=
          # the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
          # transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until
          # all conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps
          # &lt;= the read timestamp have finished.
          #
          # The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
          # timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
          #
          # These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
          # timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the
          # equivalent boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand,
          # boundedly stale reads usually return fresher results.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.
          #
          # ### Bounded Staleness
          #
          # Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
          # subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the
          # newest timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution
          # of the reads at the closest available replica without blocking.
          #
          # All rows yielded are consistent with each other -- if any part of
          # the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the
          # transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two stale
          # reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
          # different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.
          #
          # Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases: the first phase
          # negotiates a timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the
          # read. In the second phase, reads are executed at the negotiated
          # timestamp.
          #
          # As a result of the two phase execution, bounded staleness reads are
          # usually a little slower than comparable exact staleness
          # reads. However, they are typically able to return fresher
          # results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
          #
          # Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of
          # which rows will be read, it can only be used with single-use
          # read-only transactions.
          #
          # See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
          # TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.
          #
          # ### Old Read Timestamps and Garbage Collection
          #
          # Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data
          # in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known
          # as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
          # are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads
          # at read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This
          # restriction also applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose
          # timestamp become too old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with
          # too-old read timestamps fail with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
          #
          # ## Partitioned DML Transactions
          #
          # Partitioned DML transactions are used to execute DML statements with a
          # different execution strategy that provides different, and often better,
          # scalability properties for large, table-wide operations than DML in a
          # ReadWrite transaction. Smaller scoped statements, such as an OLTP workload,
          # should prefer using ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          # Partitioned DML partitions the keyspace and runs the DML statement on each
          # partition in separate, internal transactions. These transactions commit
          # automatically when complete, and run independently from one another.
          #
          # To reduce lock contention, this execution strategy only acquires read locks
          # on rows that match the WHERE clause of the statement. Additionally, the
          # smaller per-partition transactions hold locks for less time.
          #
          # That said, Partitioned DML is not a drop-in replacement for standard DML used
          # in ReadWrite transactions.
          #
          #  - The DML statement must be fully-partitionable. Specifically, the statement
          #    must be expressible as the union of many statements which each access only
          #    a single row of the table.
          #
          #  - The statement is not applied atomically to all rows of the table. Rather,
          #    the statement is applied atomically to partitions of the table, in
          #    independent transactions. Secondary index rows are updated atomically
          #    with the base table rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML does not guarantee exactly-once execution semantics
          #    against a partition. The statement will be applied at least once to each
          #    partition. It is strongly recommended that the DML statement should be
          #    idempotent to avoid unexpected results. For instance, it is potentially
          #    dangerous to run a statement such as
          #    `UPDATE table SET column = column + 1` as it could be run multiple times
          #    against some rows.
          #
          #  - The partitions are committed automatically - there is no support for
          #    Commit or Rollback. If the call returns an error, or if the client issuing
          #    the ExecuteSql call dies, it is possible that some rows had the statement
          #    executed on them successfully. It is also possible that statement was
          #    never executed against other rows.
          #
          #  - Partitioned DML transactions may only contain the execution of a single
          #    DML statement via ExecuteSql or ExecuteStreamingSql.
          #
          #  - If any error is encountered during the execution of the partitioned DML
          #    operation (for instance, a UNIQUE INDEX violation, division by zero, or a
          #    value that cannot be stored due to schema constraints), then the
          #    operation is stopped at that point and an error is returned. It is
          #    possible that at this point, some partitions have been committed (or even
          #    committed multiple times), and other partitions have not been run at all.
          #
          # Given the above, Partitioned DML is good fit for large, database-wide,
          # operations that are idempotent, such as deleting old rows from a very large
          # table.

        # be split into many `PartialResultSet` messages to accommodate

        # complete value as follows:
        #
        #   * `bool/number/null`: cannot be chunked
        #   * `string`: concatenate the strings
        #   * `list`: concatenate the lists. If the last element in a list is a
        #     `string`, `list`, or `object`, merge it with the first element in
        #     the next list by applying these rules recursively.
        #   * `object`: concatenate the (field name, field value) pairs. If a
        #     field name is duplicated, then apply these rules recursively
        #     to merge the field values.
