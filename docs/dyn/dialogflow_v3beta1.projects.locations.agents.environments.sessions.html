Args:
  session: string, Required. The name of the session this query is sent to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//sessions/` or `projects//locations//agents//environments//sessions/`. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. It&#x27;s up to the API caller to choose an appropriate `Session ID`. It can be a random number or some type of session identifiers (preferably hashed). The length of the `Session ID` must not exceed 36 characters. For more information, see the [sessions guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/session). Note: Always use agent versions for production traffic. See [Versions and environments](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/version). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request to detect user&#x27;s intent.
  &quot;outputAudioConfig&quot;: { # Instructs the speech synthesizer how to generate the output audio content. # Instructs the speech synthesizer how to generate the output audio.
    &quot;audioEncoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content.
    &quot;sampleRateHertz&quot;: 42, # Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice&#x27;s natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality).
    &quot;synthesizeSpeechConfig&quot;: { # Configuration of how speech should be synthesized. # Optional. Configuration of how speech should be synthesized.
      &quot;effectsProfileId&quot;: [ # Optional. An identifier which selects &#x27;audio effects&#x27; profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;pitch&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch.
      &quot;speakingRate&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values &lt; 0.25 or &gt; 4.0 will return an error.
      &quot;voice&quot;: { # Description of which voice to use for speech synthesis. # Optional. The desired voice of the synthesized audio.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. For the list of available voices, please refer to [Supported voices and languages](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).
        &quot;ssmlGender&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.
      },
      &quot;volumeGainDb&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there&#x27;s usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that.

If false or unspecified, Speech doesn&#x27;t return any word-level information.
        &quot;model&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters in the InputAudioConfig. If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model.

If `true`, the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio&#x27;s voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods.

When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page.

        &quot;model&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters in the InputAudioConfig. If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model.

If `true`, the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio&#x27;s voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods.
