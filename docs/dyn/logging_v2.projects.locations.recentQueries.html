  <pre>Lists the RecentQueries that were created by the user making the request.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource to which the listed queries belong. &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot; &quot;organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot; &quot;billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot; &quot;folders/[FOLDER_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot; For example:projects/my-project/locations/us-central1Note: The location portion of the resource must be specified, but supplying the character - in place of LOCATION_ID will return all recent queries. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Specifies the type (&quot;Logging&quot; or &quot;OpsAnalytics&quot;) of the recent queries to list. The only valid value for this field is one of the two allowable type function calls, which are the following: type(&quot;Logging&quot;) type(&quot;OpsAnalytics&quot;)
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request. Non-positive values are ignored. The presence of nextPageToken in the response indicates that more results might be available.
  pageToken: string, Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to this method. pageToken must be the value of nextPageToken from the previous response. The values of other method parameters should be identical to those in the previous call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

            { # A sort order for a query based on a column.
              &quot;fieldSource&quot;: { # A source that can be used to represent a field within various parts of a structured query, such as in SELECT, WHERE, or ORDER BY clauses. # The field to sort on. Can be one of the FieldSource types: field name, alias ref, variable ref, or a literal value.
                &quot;aliasRef&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The alias name for a field that has already been aliased within a different ProjectedField type elsewhere in the query model. The alias must be defined in the QueryBuilderConfig&#x27;s field_sources list, otherwise the model is invalid.
                &quot;columnType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of the selected field. This comes from the schema. Can be one of the BigQuery data types: - STRING - INT64 - FLOAT64 - BOOL - TIMESTAMP - DATE - RECORD - JSON

This path is used for primary selection and actions like drill-down or projection.The path components should match the exact field names or keys as they appear in the underlying data schema. For JSON fields, this means respecting the original casing (e.g., camelCase or snake_case as present in the JSON).To reference field names containing special characters (e.g., hyphens, spaces), enclose the individual path segment in backticks (`).Examples: * json_payload.labels.message * json_payload.request_id * httpRequest.status * json_payload.\my-custom-field`.value *jsonPayload.`my key with spaces`.data`
                &quot;isJson&quot;: True or False, # Whether the field is a JSON field, or has a parent that is a JSON field. This value is used to determine JSON extractions in generated SQL queries. Note that this is_json flag may be true when the column_type is not JSON if the parent is a JSON field. Ex: - A json_payload.message field might have is_json=true, since the &#x27;json_payload&#x27; parent is of type JSON, and columnType=&#x27;STRING&#x27; if the &#x27;message&#x27; field is of type STRING.
                &quot;parentPath&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The dot-delimited path of the parent container that holds the target field.This path defines the structural hierarchy and is essential for correctly generating SQL when field keys contain special characters (e.g., dots or brackets).Example: json_payload.labels (This points to the &#x27;labels&#x27; object). This is an empty string if the target field is at the root level.
                &quot;projectedField&quot;: { # Represents a field selected in the query, analogous to an item in a SQL SELECT clause. It specifies the source field and optionally applies transformations like aggregation, casting, regex extraction, or assigns an alias. Use ProjectedField when you need more than just the raw source field name (for which you might use FieldSource directly in QueryBuilderConfig&#x27;s field_sources list if no transformations or specific operation type are needed). # A projected field option for when a user wants to use a field with some additional transformations such as casting or extractions.
                  &quot;alias&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The alias name for the field. Valid alias examples are: - single word alias: TestAlias - numbers in an alias: Alias123 - multi word alias should be enclosed in quotes: &quot;Test Alias&quot; Invalid alias examples are: - alias containing keywords: WHERE, SELECT, FROM, etc. - alias starting with a number: 1stAlias
                  &quot;cast&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The cast for the field. This can any SQL cast type. Examples: - STRING - CHAR - DATE - TIMESTAMP - DATETIME - INT - FLOAT

                  &quot;regexExtraction&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The re2 extraction for the field. This will be used to extract the value from the field using REGEXP_EXTRACT. More information on re2 can be found here: https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax. Meta characters like +?()| will need to be escaped. Examples: - &quot;.(autoscaler.*)$&quot; will be converted to REGEXP_EXTRACT(JSON_VALUE(field),&quot;request(.*(autoscaler.*)$)&quot;)in SQL. - &quot;\(test_value\)$&quot; will be converted to REGEXP_EXTRACT(JSON_VALUE(field),&quot;request(\(test_value\)$)&quot;) in SQL.

Applies only to numeric values. &quot;min&quot;: Finds the minimum value (MIN). Applies only to numeric values. &quot;sum&quot;: Computes the sum (SUM). Applies only to numeric values.
