<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(name, action=None, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the details for an AppGroup app. In addition, you can add an API product to an AppGroup app and automatically generate an API key for the app to use when calling APIs in the API product. If you want to use an existing API key for the API product, add the API product to the API key using the UpdateAppGroupAppKey API. Using this API, you cannot update the app name, as it is the primary key used to identify the app and cannot be changed. This API replaces the existing attributes with those specified in the request. Include or exclude any existing attributes that you want to retain or delete, respectively.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the AppGroup app. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}/appgroups/{app_group_name}/apps/{app}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
