  <pre>Creates a peered DNS domain which sends requests for records in given namespace originating in the service producer VPC network to the consumer VPC network to be resolved.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource identifying the connection for which the peered DNS domain will be created in the format: `services/{service}/projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}` {service} is the peering service that is managing connectivity for the service producer&#x27;s organization. For Google services that support this functionality, this value is `servicenetworking.googleapis.com`. {project} is the number of the project that contains the service consumer&#x27;s VPC network e.g. `12345`. {network} is the name of the service consumer&#x27;s VPC network. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # DNS domain suffix for which requests originating in the producer VPC network are resolved in the associated consumer VPC network.
  &quot;dnsSuffix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The DNS domain name suffix e.g. `example.com.`.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User assigned name for this resource. Must be unique within the consumer network. The name must be 1-63 characters long, must begin with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and only contain lowercase letters, digits or dashes.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
