  <pre>Creates a new Environment.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Format: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Definition of a software environment that is used to start a notebook instance.
  &quot;containerImage&quot;: { # Definition of a container image for starting a notebook instance with the environment installed in a container. # Use a container image to start the notebook instance.
    &quot;repository&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The path to the container image repository. For example: `gcr.io/{project_id}/{image_name}`
    &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The tag of the container image. If not specified, this defaults to the latest tag.
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which this environment was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A brief description of this environment.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Display name of this environment for the UI.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Name of this environment. Format: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/environments/{environment_id}`
  &quot;postStartupScript&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Path to a Bash script that automatically runs after a notebook instance fully boots up. The path must be a URL or Cloud Storage path. Example: `&quot;gs://path-to-file/file-name&quot;`
  &quot;vmImage&quot;: { # Definition of a custom Compute Engine virtual machine image for starting a notebook instance with the environment installed directly on the VM. # Use a Compute Engine VM image to start the notebook instance.
    &quot;imageFamily&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Use this VM image family to find the image; the newest image in this family will be used.
    &quot;imageName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Use VM image name to find the image.
    &quot;project&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the Google Cloud project that this VM image belongs to. Format: `{project_id}`
  },
}

  environmentId: string, Required. User-defined unique ID of this environment. The `environment_id` must be 1 to 63 characters long and contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, and dashes. The first character must be a lowercase letter and the last character cannot be a dash.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {

    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
