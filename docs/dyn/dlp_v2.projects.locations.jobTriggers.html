    <code class="details" id="activate">activate(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Activate a job trigger. Causes the immediate execute of a trigger
instead of waiting on the trigger event to occur.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Resource name of the trigger to activate, for example
`projects/dlp-test-project/jobTriggers/53234423`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for ActivateJobTrigger.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, locationId, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, filter=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists job triggers.
See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-job-triggers to learn more.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource name, for example `projects/my-project-id`. (required)
  locationId: string, The geographic location where job triggers will be retrieved from.
Use `-` for all locations. Reserved for future extensions. (required)
  orderBy: string, Comma separated list of triggeredJob fields to order by,
followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case-insensitive,
default sorting order is ascending, redundant space characters are
insignificant.

Example: `name asc,update_time, create_time desc`

Supported fields are:

- `create_time`: corresponds to time the JobTrigger was created.
- `update_time`: corresponds to time the JobTrigger was last updated.
- `last_run_time`: corresponds to the last time the JobTrigger ran.
- `name`: corresponds to JobTrigger&#x27;s name.
- `display_name`: corresponds to JobTrigger&#x27;s display name.
- `status`: corresponds to JobTrigger&#x27;s status.
  pageToken: string, Page token to continue retrieval. Comes from previous call
to ListJobTriggers. `order_by` field must not
change for subsequent calls.
  pageSize: integer, Size of the page, can be limited by a server.
  filter: string, Allows filtering.

Supported syntax:

* Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions.
* Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A
sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`.
* A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`.
* Supported fields/values for inspect jobs:
    - `status` - HEALTHY|PAUSED|CANCELLED
    - `inspected_storage` - DATASTORE|CLOUD_STORAGE|BIGQUERY
    - &#x27;last_run_time` - RFC 3339 formatted timestamp, surrounded by
    quotation marks. Nanoseconds are ignored.
    - &#x27;error_count&#x27; - Number of errors that have occurred while running.
* The operator must be `=` or `!=` for status and inspected_storage.

Examples:

* inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND status = HEALTHY
* inspected_storage = cloud_storage OR inspected_storage = bigquery
* inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND (state = PAUSED OR state = HEALTHY)
* last_run_time &gt; \&quot;2017-12-12T00:00:00+00:00\&quot;

The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
