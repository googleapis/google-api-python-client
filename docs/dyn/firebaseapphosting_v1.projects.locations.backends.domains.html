If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  orderBy: string, Optional. Hint for how to order the results. Supported fields are `name` and `createTime`. To specify descending order, append a `desc` suffix.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of results to return. If not set, the service selects a default.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token received from the nextPageToken field in the response. Send that page token to receive the subsequent page.
  showDeleted: boolean, Optional. If true, the request returns soft-deleted resources that haven&#x27;t been fully-deleted yet.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

}

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set to true, and the domain is not found, a new domain will be created.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Domain resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. Indicates that the request should be validated and default values populated, without persisting the request or modifying any resources.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
