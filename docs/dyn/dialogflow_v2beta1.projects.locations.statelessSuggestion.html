A top-k of 1 means the selected token is the most probable among all tokens in the model&#x27;s vocabulary (also called greedy decoding), while a top-k of 3 means that the next token is selected from among the 3 most probable tokens (using temperature). For each token selection step, the top K tokens with the highest probabilities are sampled. Then tokens are further filtered based on topP with the final token selected using temperature sampling.

      &quot;topP&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Top-p changes how the model selects tokens for output.

For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the top-p value is 0.5, then the model will select either A or B as the next token (using temperature) and doesn&#x27;t consider C.
