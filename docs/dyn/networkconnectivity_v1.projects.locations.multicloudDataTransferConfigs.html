  <pre>Creates a MulticloudDataTransferConfig in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource&#x27;s name (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The MulticloudDataTransferConfig resource. This lists the services for which customer is opting in for Multicloud Data Transfer.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the MulticloudDataTransferConfig was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An optional field to provide a description of this resource.
  &quot;destinationsActiveCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. The number of Destinations in use under the MulticloudDataTransferConfig resource.
  &quot;destinationsCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. The number of Destinations configured under the MulticloudDataTransferConfig resource.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The etag is computed by the server, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. User-defined labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The name of the MulticloudDataTransferConfig resource. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/multicloudDataTransferConfigs/{multicloud_data_transfer_config}`.
  &quot;services&quot;: { # Optional. This map services to either their current or planned states. Service names are keys, and the associated values describe the service&#x27;s state. If a state change is expected, the value will be the list of ADDING or DELETING states depending on the actions taken. Example: &quot;services&quot;: { &quot;big-query&quot;: { &quot;states&quot;: [ { &quot;state&quot;: &quot;ADDING&quot;, &quot;effective_time&quot;: &quot;2024-12-12T08:00:00Z&quot; }, ] }, &quot;cloud-storage&quot;: { &quot;states&quot;: [ { &quot;state&quot;: &quot;ACTIVE&quot;, } ] } }
    &quot;a_key&quot;: { # The timeline of pending states for a resource.
      &quot;states&quot;: [ # Output only. The state and activation time details of the resource state.
        { # The state and activation time details of the resource state.
          &quot;effectiveTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. This field will be accompanied only with transient states (PENDING_ADD, PENDING_DELETE, PENDING_SUSPENSION) and denotes the time when the transient state of the resource will be effective. For instance, if the state is &quot;ADDING,&quot; this field will show the time the resource transitions to &quot;ACTIVE.&quot; Similarly, if the state is &quot;PENDING_DELETE,&quot; it will show the deletion time.
          &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the resource.
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The Google-generated UUID for the MulticloudDataTransferConfig. This value is unique across all MulticloudDataTransferConfig resources. If a MulticloudDataTransferConfig is deleted and another with the same name is created, the new MulticloudDataTransferConfig is assigned a different uid.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the MulticloudDataTransferConfig was updated.
}

  multicloudDataTransferConfigId: string, Required. The ID to use for the MulticloudDataTransferConfig, which will become the final component of the MulticloudDataTransferConfig&#x27;s resource name.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate MulticloudDataTransferConfigs. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate MulticloudDataTransferConfigs. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the MulticloudDataTransferConfig resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
