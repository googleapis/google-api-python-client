<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="disableXpnHost">disableXpnHost(project, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Disable this project as a shared VPC host project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getXpnResources">getXpnResources(project, order_by=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets service resources (a.k.a service project) associated with this host project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  order_by: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setUsageExportBucket">setUsageExportBucket(project, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Enables the usage export feature and sets the usage export bucket where reports are stored. If you provide an empty request body using this method, the usage export feature will be disabled.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The location in Cloud Storage and naming method of the daily usage report. Contains bucket_name and report_name prefix.
  "bucketName": "A String", # The name of an existing bucket in Cloud Storage where the usage report object is stored. The Google Service Account is granted write access to this bucket. This can either be the bucket name by itself, such as example-bucket, or the bucket name with gs:// or https://storage.googleapis.com/ in front of it, such as gs://example-bucket.
  "reportNamePrefix": "A String", # An optional prefix for the name of the usage report object stored in bucketName. If not supplied, defaults to usage. The report is stored as a CSV file named report_name_prefix_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv where YYYYMMDD is the day of the usage according to Pacific Time. If you supply a prefix, it should conform to Cloud Storage object naming conventions.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents an Operation resource.
      #
      # You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses.
      #
      # Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
      # - For global operations, use the globalOperations resource.
      # - For regional operations, use the regionOperations resource.
      # - For zonal operations, use the zonalOperations resource.
      #
      # For more information, read  Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.

    "creationTimestamp": "A String", # [Deprecated] This field is deprecated.
    "id": "A String", # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
    "zone": "A String", # [Output Only] The URL of the zone where the operation resides. Only applicable when performing per-zone operations.
    "insertTime": "A String", # [Output Only] The time that this operation was requested. This value is in RFC3339 text format.
    "operationType": "A String", # [Output Only] The type of operation, such as insert, update, or delete, and so on.

    "progress": 42, # [Output Only] An optional progress indicator that ranges from 0 to 100. There is no requirement that this be linear or support any granularity of operations. This should not be used to guess when the operation will be complete. This number should monotonically increase as the operation progresses.
    "httpErrorStatusCode": 42, # [Output Only] If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error status code that was returned. For example, a 404 means the resource was not found.
    "statusMessage": "A String", # [Output Only] An optional textual description of the current status of the operation.
    "status": "A String", # [Output Only] The status of the operation, which can be one of the following: PENDING, RUNNING, or DONE.

            "value": "A String", # [Output Only] A warning data value corresponding to the key.
            "key": "A String", # [Output Only] A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding).
