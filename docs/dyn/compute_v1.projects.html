  <pre>Disable this project as a shared VPC host project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="enableXpnResource">enableXpnResource(project, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Enable service resource (a.k.a service project) for a host project, so that subnets in the host project can be used by instances in the service project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;xpnResource&quot;: { # Service resource (a.k.a service project) ID. # Service resource (a.k.a service project) ID.
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID of the service resource. In the case of projects, this field supports project id (e.g., my-project-123) and project number (e.g. 12345678).
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of the service resource.
  },
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  <pre>Gets service resources (a.k.a service project) associated with this host project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#projectsGetXpnResources&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#projectsGetXpnResources for lists of service resources (a.k.a service projects)
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.
  &quot;resources&quot;: [ # Service resources (a.k.a service projects) attached to this project as their shared VPC host.
    { # Service resource (a.k.a service project) ID.
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID of the service resource. In the case of projects, this field supports project id (e.g., my-project-123) and project number (e.g. 12345678).

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="moveDisk">moveDisk(project, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Moves a persistent disk from one zone to another.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;destinationZone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL of the destination zone to move the disk. This can be a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs to a zone:
      # - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone

      # - projects/project/zones/zone/disks/disk
      # - zones/zone/disks/disk
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setDefaultNetworkTier">setDefaultNetworkTier(project, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the default network tier of the project. The default network tier is used when an address/forwardingRule/instance is created without specifying the network tier field.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;networkTier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Default network tier to be set.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:
