<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setUsageExportBucket">setUsageExportBucket(project, body)</code>
  <pre>Enables the usage export feature and sets the usage export bucket where reports are stored. If you provide an empty request body using this method, the usage export feature will be disabled.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The location in Cloud Storage and naming method of the daily usage report. Contains bucket_name and report_name prefix.
  "bucketName": "A String", # The name of an existing bucket in Cloud Storage where the usage report object is stored. The Google Service Account is granted write access to this bucket. This can either be the bucket name by itself, such as example-bucket, or the bucket name with gs:// or https://storage.googleapis.com/ in front of it, such as gs://example-bucket.
  "reportNamePrefix": "A String", # An optional prefix for the name of the usage report object stored in bucketName. If not supplied, defaults to usage. The report is stored as a CSV file named report_name_prefix_gce_YYYYMMDD.csv where YYYYMMDD is the day of the usage according to Pacific Time. If you supply a prefix, it should conform to Cloud Storage object naming conventions.
}


Returns:
  An object of the form:
