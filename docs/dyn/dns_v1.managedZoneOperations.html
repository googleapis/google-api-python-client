<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(project, managedZone, operation, clientOperationId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Fetches the representation of an existing Operation.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)
  managedZone: string, Identifies the managed zone addressed by this request. (required)
  operation: string, Identifies the operation addressed by this request (ID of the operation). (required)
  clientOperationId: string, For mutating operation requests only. An optional identifier specified by the client. Must be unique for operation resources in the Operations collection.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, managedZone, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, sortBy=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Enumerates Operations for the given ManagedZone.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)
  managedZone: string, Identifies the managed zone addressed by this request. (required)
  maxResults: integer, Optional. Maximum number of results to be returned. If unspecified, the server decides how many results to return.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A tag returned by a previous list request that was truncated. Use this parameter to continue a previous list request.
  sortBy: string, Sorting criterion. The only supported values are START_TIME and ID.
    Allowed values
      startTime - 
      id - 
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
