          &quot;repo&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Git repository the package should be cloned from.
        },
        &quot;googleCloudStorage&quot;: { # Cloud Storage bucket containing Skaffold Config modules. # Cloud Storage bucket containing the Skaffold Config modules.
          &quot;path&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Relative path from the source to the Skaffold file.
          &quot;source&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Cloud Storage source paths to copy recursively. For example, providing &quot;gs://my-bucket/dir/configs/*&quot; will result in Skaffold copying all files within the &quot;dir/configs&quot; directory in the bucket &quot;my-bucket&quot;.
        },
      },
    ],
    &quot;renderAction&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The Skaffold custom action responsible for render operations. If not provided then Cloud Deploy will perform the render operations via `skaffold render`.
  },

  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Description of the `CustomTargetType`. Max length is 255 characters.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels are attributes that can be set and used by both the user and by Cloud Deploy. Labels must meet the following constraints: * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. * All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character. * Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels.

}

  customTargetTypeId: string, Required. ID of the `CustomTargetType`.
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set to true, the request is validated and the user is provided with an expected result, but no actual change is made.

  <pre>Updates a single CustomTargetType.

Args:
  name: string, Optional. Name of the `CustomTargetType`. Format is `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/customTargetTypes/a-z{0,62}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A `CustomTargetType` resource in the Cloud Deploy API. A `CustomTargetType` defines a type of custom target that can be referenced in a `Target` in order to facilitate deploying to a runtime that does not have a 1P integration with Cloud Deploy.
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Optional. User annotations. These attributes can only be set and used by the user, and not by Cloud Deploy. See https://google.aip.dev/128#annotations for more details such as format and size limitations.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time at which the `CustomTargetType` was created.
  &quot;customActions&quot;: { # CustomTargetSkaffoldActions represents the `CustomTargetType` configuration using Skaffold custom actions. # Configures render and deploy for the `CustomTargetType` using Skaffold custom actions.
    &quot;deployAction&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The Skaffold custom action responsible for deploy operations.
    &quot;includeSkaffoldModules&quot;: [ # Optional. List of Skaffold modules Cloud Deploy will include in the Skaffold Config as required before performing diagnose.
      { # Skaffold Config modules and their remote source.
        &quot;configs&quot;: [ # Optional. The Skaffold Config modules to use from the specified source.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;git&quot;: { # Git repository containing Skaffold Config modules. # Remote git repository containing the Skaffold Config modules.
          &quot;path&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Relative path from the repository root to the Skaffold file.
          &quot;ref&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Git ref the package should be cloned from.
          &quot;repo&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Git repository the package should be cloned from.
        },
        &quot;googleCloudStorage&quot;: { # Cloud Storage bucket containing Skaffold Config modules. # Cloud Storage bucket containing the Skaffold Config modules.
          &quot;path&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Relative path from the source to the Skaffold file.
          &quot;source&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Cloud Storage source paths to copy recursively. For example, providing &quot;gs://my-bucket/dir/configs/*&quot; will result in Skaffold copying all files within the &quot;dir/configs&quot; directory in the bucket &quot;my-bucket&quot;.
        },
      },
    ],
    &quot;renderAction&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The Skaffold custom action responsible for render operations. If not provided then Cloud Deploy will perform the render operations via `skaffold render`.
  },
  &quot;customTargetTypeId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Resource id of the `CustomTargetType`.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Description of the `CustomTargetType`. Max length is 255 characters.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels are attributes that can be set and used by both the user and by Cloud Deploy. Labels must meet the following constraints: * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. * All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character. * Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels. Both keys and values are additionally constrained to be &lt;= 128 bytes.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Name of the `CustomTargetType`. Format is `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/customTargetTypes/a-z{0,62}`.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Unique identifier of the `CustomTargetType`.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Most recent time at which the `CustomTargetType` was updated.
}

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set to true, updating a `CustomTargetType` that does not exist will result in the creation of a new `CustomTargetType`.
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `CustomTargetType` resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set to true, the request is validated and the user is provided with an expected result, but no actual change is made.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
