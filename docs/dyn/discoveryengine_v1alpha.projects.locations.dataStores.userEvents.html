<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="collect">collect(parent, ets=None, uri=None, userEvent=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Writes a single user event from the browser. This uses a GET request to due to browser restriction of POST-ing to a 3rd party domain. This method is used only by the Discovery Engine API JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager. Users should not call this method directly.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent DataStore resource name, such as `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/dataStores/{data_store}`. (required)
  ets: string, The event timestamp in milliseconds. This prevents browser caching of otherwise identical get requests. The name is abbreviated to reduce the payload bytes.
  uri: string, The URL including cgi-parameters but excluding the hash fragment with a length limit of 5,000 characters. This is often more useful than the referer URL, because many browsers only send the domain for 3rd party requests.
  userEvent: string, Required. URL encoded UserEvent proto with a length limit of 2,000,000 characters.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for payload formats that can&#x27;t be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or an HTML page. This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example: message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id = 1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
  &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP Content-Type header value specifying the content type of the body.
  &quot;data&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP request/response body as raw binary.

If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events, also include them in the user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events provided with prediction requests.

This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or conversion completion back to the event and the particular predict response containing this clicked/purchased product. If user clicks on product K in the recommendation results, pass PredictResponse.attribution_token as a URL parameter to product K&#x27;s page. When recording events on product K&#x27;s page, log the PredictResponse.attribution_token to this field.

This unique identifier should not change if the visitor log in/out of the website. Do not set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters.

These attributes must NOT contain data that needs to be parsed or processed further, e.g. JSON or other encodings.

Custom attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events provided with prediction requests. This lets the Discovery Engine API use those custom attributes when training models and serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality. This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. For product recommendations, an example of extra user information is traffic_channel, which is how a user arrives at the site. Users can arrive at the site by coming to the site directly, coming through Google search, or in other ways.

    &quot;currency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Currency code. Use three-character ISO-4217 code.
    &quot;discountValue&quot;: 3.14, # The total discount(s) value applied to this transaction. This figure should be excluded from TransactionInfo.value For example, if a user paid TransactionInfo.value amount, then nominal (pre-discount) value of the transaction is the sum of TransactionInfo.value and TransactionInfo.discount_value This means that profit is calculated the same way, regardless of the discount value, and that TransactionInfo.discount_value can be larger than TransactionInfo.value: * Profit = value - tax - cost
    &quot;tax&quot;: 3.14, # All the taxes associated with the transaction.
    &quot;transactionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The transaction ID with a length limit of 128 characters.
    &quot;value&quot;: 3.14, # Required. Total non-zero value associated with the transaction. This value may include shipping, tax, or other adjustments to the total value that you want to include.
  },
  &quot;userInfo&quot;: { # Information of an end user. # Information about the end user.
    &quot;userAgent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User agent as included in the HTTP header. Required for getting SearchResponse.sponsored_results. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. This should not be set when using the client side event reporting with GTM or JavaScript tag in UserEventService.CollectUserEvent or if direct_user_request is set.
    &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Highly recommended for logged-in users. Unique identifier for logged-in user, such as a user name. Don&#x27;t set for anonymous users. Always use a hashed value for this ID. Don&#x27;t set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
  },
  &quot;userPseudoId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if the visitor log in/out of the website. Do not set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend to use Google Analytics [Client ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId) for this field.
