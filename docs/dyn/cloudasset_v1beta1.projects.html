  <pre>Batch gets the update history of assets that overlap a time window.
For RESOURCE content, this API outputs history with asset in both
non-delete or deleted status.
For IAM_POLICY content, this API outputs history when the asset and its
attached IAM POLICY both exist. This can create gaps in the output history.
If a specified asset does not exist, this API returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT
error.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. It can only be an
organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a project ID (such as
&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;)&quot;, or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;). (required)
  contentType: string, Optional. The content type.
  readTimeWindow_endTime: string, End time of the time window (inclusive).
Current timestamp if not specified.
  readTimeWindow_startTime: string, Start time of the time window (exclusive).
  assetNames: string, A list of the full names of the assets. For example:
`//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1`.
See [Resource
Names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name)
for more info.

The request becomes a no-op if the asset name list is empty, and the max
size of the asset name list is 100 in one request. (repeated)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

              #
              # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
              # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
              # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
              # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
              # custom role.
              #
              # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
              # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
              # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
              # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
              # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="exportAssets">exportAssets(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage
location. The output format is newline-delimited JSON.
This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API allowing you
to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds
with exponential retry to poll the export operation result. For
regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually finishes within
5 minutes.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an
organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a project ID (such as
&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;), or
a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Export asset request.
    &quot;assetTypes&quot;: [ # A list of asset types of which to take a snapshot for. For example:
        # &quot;google.compute.Disk&quot;. If specified, only matching assets will be returned.
        # See [Introduction to Cloud Asset
        # Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview)
        # for all supported asset types.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;readTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Timestamp to take an asset snapshot. This can only be set to a timestamp
        # between 2018-10-02 UTC (inclusive) and the current time. If not specified,
        # the current time will be used. Due to delays in resource data collection
        # and indexing, there is a volatile window during which running the same
        # query may get different results.
    &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name will be
        # returned.
    &quot;outputConfig&quot;: { # Output configuration for export assets destination. # Required. Output configuration indicating where the results will be output
        # to. All results will be in newline delimited JSON format.
      &quot;gcsDestination&quot;: { # A Cloud Storage location. # Destination on Cloud Storage.
        &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The uri of the Cloud Storage object. It&#x27;s the same uri that is used by
            # gsutil. For example: &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name&quot;. See [Viewing and
            # Editing Object
            # Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/viewing-editing-metadata)
            # for more information.
        &quot;uriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The uri prefix of all generated Cloud Storage objects. For example:
            # &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix&quot;. Each object uri is in format:
            # &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/&lt;asset type&gt;/&lt;shard number&gt; and only
            # contains assets for that type. &lt;shard number&gt; starts from 0. For example:
            # &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/google.compute.disk/0&quot; is the first
            # shard of output objects containing all google.compute.disk assets.
            # An INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned if file with the same name
            # &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix&quot; already exists.
      },
    },
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name

        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
