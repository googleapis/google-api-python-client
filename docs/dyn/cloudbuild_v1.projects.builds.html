For triggered builds: * Triggered builds resolve to a precise revision; therefore a retry of a triggered build will result in a build that uses the same revision. For non-triggered builds that specify `RepoSource`: * If the original build built from the tip of a branch, the retried build will build from the tip of that branch, which may not be the same revision as the original build. * If the original build specified a commit sha or revision ID, the retried build will use the identical source. For builds that specify `StorageSource`: * If the original build pulled source from Google Cloud Storage without specifying the generation of the object, the new build will use the current object, which may be different from the original build source. * If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage and specified the generation of the object, the new build will attempt to use the same object, which may or may not be available depending on the bucket's lifecycle management settings.</p>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="retry">retry(projectId, id, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new build based on the specified build. This method creates a new build using the original build request, which may or may not result in an identical build. For triggered builds: * Triggered builds resolve to a precise revision; therefore a retry of a triggered build will result in a build that uses the same revision. For non-triggered builds that specify `RepoSource`: * If the original build built from the tip of a branch, the retried build will build from the tip of that branch, which may not be the same revision as the original build. * If the original build specified a commit sha or revision ID, the retried build will use the identical source. For builds that specify `StorageSource`: * If the original build pulled source from Google Cloud Storage without specifying the generation of the object, the new build will use the current object, which may be different from the original build source. * If the original build pulled source from Cloud Storage and specified the generation of the object, the new build will attempt to use the same object, which may or may not be available depending on the bucket&#x27;s lifecycle management settings.

Args:
  projectId: string, Required. ID of the project. (required)
  id: string, Required. Build ID of the original build. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Specifies a build to retry.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Build ID of the original build.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the `Build` to retry. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/builds/{build}`
  &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. ID of the project.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
