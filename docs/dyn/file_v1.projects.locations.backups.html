  <pre>Creates a backup.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The backup&#x27;s project and location, in the format `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}`. In Filestore, backup locations map to Google Cloud regions, for example **us-west1**. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the backup was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the backup with 2048 characters or less. Requests with longer descriptions will be rejected.
  &quot;downloadBytes&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Amount of bytes that will be downloaded if the backup is restored. This may be different than storage bytes, since sequential backups of the same disk will share storage.
  &quot;kmsKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. KMS key name used for data encryption.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Resource labels to represent user provided metadata.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
