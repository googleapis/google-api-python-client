<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(project, deployment, manifest)</code>
  <pre>Gets information about a specific manifest.

Args:
  project: string, The project ID for this request. (required)
  deployment: string, The name of the deployment for this request. (required)
  manifest: string, The name of the manifest for this request. (required)

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "layout": "A String", # [Output Only] The YAML layout for this manifest.
    "name": "A String", # [Output Only] The name of the manifest.
    "expandedConfig": "A String", # [Output Only] The fully-expanded configuration file, including any templates and references.
    "imports": [ # [Output Only] The imported files for this manifest.
      {
        "content": "A String", # The contents of the file.
        "name": "A String", # The name of the file.
      },
    ],
    "insertTime": "A String", # [Output Only] Timestamp when the manifest was created, in RFC3339 text format.
    "config": { # [Output Only] The YAML configuration for this manifest.
      "content": "A String", # The contents of the file.
    },
    "id": "A String", # [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.
    "selfLink": "A String", # [Output Only] Self link for the manifest.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, deployment, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all manifests for a given deployment.

Args:
  project: string, The project ID for this request. (required)
  deployment: string, The name of the deployment for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A response containing a partial list of manifests and a page token used to build the next request if the request has been truncated.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] A token used to continue a truncated list request.
    "manifests": [ # [Output Only] Manifests contained in this list response.
      {
        "layout": "A String", # [Output Only] The YAML layout for this manifest.
        "name": "A String", # [Output Only] The name of the manifest.
        "expandedConfig": "A String", # [Output Only] The fully-expanded configuration file, including any templates and references.
        "imports": [ # [Output Only] The imported files for this manifest.

      },
    ],
  }</pre>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
