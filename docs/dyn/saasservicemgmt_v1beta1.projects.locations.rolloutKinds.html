The configuration for error budget. If the number of failed units exceeds max(allowed_count, allowed_ratio * total_units), the rollout will be paused. If not set, all units will be attempted to be updated regardless of the number of failures encountered.
    &quot;allowedCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum number of failed units allowed in a location without pausing the rollout.
    &quot;allowedPercentage&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum percentage of units allowed to fail (0, 100] within a location without pausing the rollout.
  },
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. An opaque value that uniquely identifies a version or generation of a resource. It can be used to confirm that the client and server agree on the ordering of a resource being written.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. The labels on the resource, which can be used for categorization. similar to Kubernetes resource labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },

  &quot;rolloutOrchestrationStrategy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The strategy used for executing a Rollout. This is a required field. There are two supported values strategies which are used to control - &quot;Google.Cloud.Simple.AllAtOnce&quot; - &quot;Google.Cloud.Simple.OneLocationAtATime&quot; A rollout with one of these simple strategies will rollout across all locations defined in the associated UnitKind&#x27;s Saas Locations.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of the resource. UID is unique in the time and space for this resource within the scope of the service. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and must not be changed. UID is used to uniquely identify resources with resource name reuses. This should be a UUID4.
  &quot;unitFilter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. CEL(https://github.com/google/cel-spec) formatted filter string against Unit. The filter will be applied to determine the eligible unit population. This filter can only reduce, but not expand the scope of the rollout.

  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was last updated. Any change to the resource made by users must refresh this value. Changes to a resource made by the service should refresh this value.
  &quot;updateUnitKindStrategy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The config for updating the unit kind. By default, the unit kind will be updated on the rollout start.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  rolloutKindId: string, Required. The ID value for the new rollout kind.
  validateOnly: boolean, If &quot;validate_only&quot; is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, etag=None, requestId=None, validateOnly=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Delete a single rollout kind.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the resource within a service. (required)
  etag: string, The etag known to the client for the expected state of the rollout kind. This is used with state-changing methods to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in parallel on the same resource. An etag wildcard provide optimistic concurrency based on the expected existence of the rollout kind. The Any wildcard (`*`) requires that the resource must already exists, and the Not Any wildcard (`!*`) requires that it must not.
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

If the user does not provide a mask then all fields in the RolloutKind will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, If &quot;validate_only&quot; is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An object that describes various settings of Rollout execution. Includes built-in policies across GCP and GDC, and customizable policies.
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Optional. Annotations is an unstructured key-value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;errorBudget&quot;: { # The configuration for error budget. If the number of failed units exceeds max(allowed_count, allowed_ratio * total_units), the rollout will be paused. # Optional. The configuration for error budget. If the number of failed units exceeds max(allowed_count, allowed_ratio * total_units), the rollout will be paused. If not set, all units will be attempted to be updated regardless of the number of failures encountered.
    &quot;allowedCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum number of failed units allowed in a location without pausing the rollout.
    &quot;allowedPercentage&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum percentage of units allowed to fail (0, 100] within a location without pausing the rollout.
  },
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. An opaque value that uniquely identifies a version or generation of a resource. It can be used to confirm that the client and server agree on the ordering of a resource being written.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. The labels on the resource, which can be used for categorization. similar to Kubernetes resource labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The resource name (full URI of the resource) following the standard naming scheme: &quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/rolloutKinds/{rollout_kind_id}&quot;
  &quot;rolloutOrchestrationStrategy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The strategy used for executing a Rollout. This is a required field. There are two supported values strategies which are used to control - &quot;Google.Cloud.Simple.AllAtOnce&quot; - &quot;Google.Cloud.Simple.OneLocationAtATime&quot; A rollout with one of these simple strategies will rollout across all locations defined in the associated UnitKind&#x27;s Saas Locations.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of the resource. UID is unique in the time and space for this resource within the scope of the service. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and must not be changed. UID is used to uniquely identify resources with resource name reuses. This should be a UUID4.
  &quot;unitFilter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. CEL(https://github.com/google/cel-spec) formatted filter string against Unit. The filter will be applied to determine the eligible unit population. This filter can only reduce, but not expand the scope of the rollout.
  &quot;unitKind&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. UnitKind that this rollout kind corresponds to. Rollouts stemming from this rollout kind will target the units of this unit kind. In other words, this defines the population of target units to be upgraded by rollouts.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was last updated. Any change to the resource made by users must refresh this value. Changes to a resource made by the service should refresh this value.
  &quot;updateUnitKindStrategy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The config for updating the unit kind. By default, the unit kind will be updated on the rollout start.
