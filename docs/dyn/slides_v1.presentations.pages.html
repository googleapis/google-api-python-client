However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`.

Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters. As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request.

As such, when reading the style of a range of text, the value of `weighted_font_family#font_family` will always be equal to that of `font_family`. However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`. If so, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned. * If `weighted_font_family` is set and `font_family` is not, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. * If neither field is set, the font family and weight of the text inherit from the parent. Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

Weights greater than or equal to `700` are considered bold, and weights less than `700`are not bold. The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;).
