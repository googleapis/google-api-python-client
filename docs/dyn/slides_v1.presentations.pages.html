<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getThumbnail">getThumbnail(presentationId, pageObjectId, thumbnailProperties_thumbnailSize=None, thumbnailProperties_mimeType=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Generates a thumbnail of the latest version of the specified page in the
presentation and returns a URL to the thumbnail image.

This request counts as an [expensive read request](/slides/limits) for
quota purposes.

Args:
  presentationId: string, The ID of the presentation to retrieve. (required)
  pageObjectId: string, The object ID of the page whose thumbnail to retrieve. (required)
  thumbnailProperties_thumbnailSize: string, The optional thumbnail image size.

If you don&#x27;t specify the size, the server chooses a default size of the
image.
  thumbnailProperties_mimeType: string, The optional mime type of the thumbnail image.

If you don&#x27;t specify the mime type, the mime type defaults to PNG.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The thumbnail of a page.
    &quot;width&quot;: 42, # The positive width in pixels of the thumbnail image.
    &quot;height&quot;: 42, # The positive height in pixels of the thumbnail image.
    &quot;contentUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The content URL of the thumbnail image.
        #
        # The URL to the image has a default lifetime of 30 minutes.
        # This URL is tagged with the account of the requester. Anyone with the URL
        # effectively accesses the image as the original requester. Access to the
        # image may be lost if the presentation&#x27;s sharing settings change.
        # The mime type of the thumbnail image is the same as specified in the
        # `GetPageThumbnailRequest`.
