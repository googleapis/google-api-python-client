  <pre>Deletes the specified `RegionalInventory` resource from the given product in your merchant account. It might take up to an hour for the `RegionalInventory` to be deleted from the specific product. Once you have received a successful delete response, wait for that period before attempting a delete again.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the `RegionalInventory` resource to delete. Format: `accounts/{account}/products/{product}/regionalInventories/{region}` The `{product}` segment is a unique identifier for the product. This identifier must be unique within a merchant account and generally follows the structure: `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `en~US~sku123` For legacy local products, the structure is: `local~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `local~en~US~sku123` The format of the `{product}` segment in the URL is automatically detected by the server, supporting two options: 1. **Encoded Format**: The `{product}` segment is an unpadded base64url encoded string (RFC 4648 Section 5). The decoded string must result in the `content_language~feed_label~offer_id` structure. This encoding MUST be used if any part of the product identifier (like `offer_id`) contains characters such as `/`, `%`, or `~`. * Example: To represent the product ID `en~US~sku/123` for `region` &quot;region123&quot;, the `{product}` segment must be the base64url encoding of this string, which is `ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. The full resource name for the regional inventory would be `accounts/123/products/ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw/regionalInventories/region123`. 2. **Plain Format**: The `{product}` segment is the tilde-separated string `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. This format is suitable only when `content_language`, `feed_label`, and `offer_id` do not contain URL-problematic characters like `/`, `%`, or `~`. We recommend using the **Encoded Format** for all product IDs to ensure correct parsing, especially those containing special characters. The presence of tilde (`~`) characters in the `{product}` segment is used to differentiate between the two formats. Note: For calls to the v1beta version, the plain format for the product segment is `channel~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. For example, the full resource name for a regional inventory in `region` &quot;region123&quot; would be: `accounts/123/products/online~en~US~sku123/regionalInventories/region123`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

Example: `local~en~US~sku123` The format of the `{product}` segment in the URL is automatically detected by the server, supporting two options: 1. **Encoded Format**: The `{product}` segment is an unpadded base64url encoded string (RFC 4648 Section 5). The decoded string must result in the `content_language~feed_label~offer_id` structure. This encoding MUST be used if any part of the product identifier (like `offer_id`) contains characters such as `/`, `%`, or `~`. * Example: To represent the product ID `en~US~sku/123`, the `{product}` segment must be the base64url encoding of this string, which is `ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. The full resource name for the product would be `accounts/123/products/ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. 2. **Plain Format**: The `{product}` segment is the tilde-separated string `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. This format is suitable only when `content_language`, `feed_label`, and `offer_id` do not contain URL-problematic characters like `/`, `%`, or `~`. We recommend using the **Encoded Format** for all product IDs to ensure correct parsing, especially those containing special characters. The presence of tilde (`~`) characters in the `{product}` segment is used to differentiate between the two formats. Note: For calls to the v1beta version, the plain format is `channel~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`, for example: `accounts/123/products/online~en~US~sku123`. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of `RegionalInventory` resources for the given product to return. The service returns fewer than this value if the number of inventories for the given product is less that than the `pageSize`. The default value is 25000. The maximum value is 100000; If a value higher than the maximum is specified, then the `pageSize` will default to the maximum.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListRegionalInventories` call. Provide the page token to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListRegionalInventories` must match the call that provided the page token. The token returned as nextPageToken in the response to the previous request.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for the `ListRegionalInventories` method.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A token, which can be sent as `pageToken` to retrieve the next page. If this field is omitted, there are no subsequent pages.
  &quot;regionalInventories&quot;: [ # The `RegionalInventory` resources for the given product from the specified account.
    { # Regional inventory information for the product. Represents specific information like price and availability for a given product in a specific `region`.

      &quot;account&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The account that owns the product. This field will be ignored if set by the client.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the `RegionalInventory` resource. Format: `accounts/{account}/products/{product}/regionalInventories/{region}` The `{product}` segment is a unique identifier for the product. This identifier must be unique within a merchant account and generally follows the structure: `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `en~US~sku123` For legacy local products, the structure is: `local~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `local~en~US~sku123` The format of the `{product}` segment in the URL is automatically detected by the server, supporting two options: 1. **Encoded Format**: The `{product}` segment is an unpadded base64url encoded string (RFC 4648 Section 5).

This encoding MUST be used if any part of the product identifier (like `offer_id`) contains characters such as `/`, `%`, or `~`. * Example: To represent the product ID `en~US~sku/123` for `region` &quot;region123&quot;, the `{product}` segment must be the base64url encoding of this string, which is `ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. The full resource name for the regional inventory would be `accounts/123/products/ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw/regionalInventories/region123`. 2. **Plain Format**: The `{product}` segment is the tilde-separated string `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`.
