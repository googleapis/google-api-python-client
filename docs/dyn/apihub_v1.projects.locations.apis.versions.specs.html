Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent, which owns this collection of specs. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/apis/{api}/versions/{version}` (required)
  filter: string, Optional. An expression that filters the list of Specs. A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string. The comparison operator must be one of: `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `:` or `=`. Filters are not case sensitive. The following fields in the `Spec` are eligible for filtering: * `display_name` - The display name of the Spec. Allowed comparison operators: `=`. * `create_time` - The time at which the Spec was created. The value should be in the (RFC3339)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339] format. Allowed comparison operators: `&gt;` and `&lt;`. * `spec_type.enum_values.values.id` - The allowed value id of the spec_type attribute associated with the Spec. Allowed comparison operators: `:`. * `spec_type.enum_values.values.display_name` - The allowed value display name of the spec_type attribute associated with the Spec. Allowed comparison operators: `:`. * `lint_response.json_values.values` - The json value of the lint_response attribute associated with the Spec. Allowed comparison operators: `:`. * `mime_type` - The MIME type of the Spec. Allowed comparison operators: `=`. * `attributes.projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/ attributes/user-defined-attribute-id.enum_values.values.id` - The allowed value id of the user defined enum attribute associated with the Resource. Allowed comparison operator is `:`. Here user-defined-attribute-enum-id is a placeholder that can be replaced with any user defined enum attribute name. * `attributes.projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/ attributes/user-defined-attribute-id.enum_values.values.display_name` - The allowed value display name of the user defined enum attribute associated with the Resource. Allowed comparison operator is `:`. Here user-defined-attribute-enum-display-name is a placeholder that can be replaced with any user defined enum attribute enum name. * `attributes.projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/ attributes/user-defined-attribute-id.string_values.values` - The allowed value of the user defined string attribute associated with the Resource. Allowed comparison operator is `:`. Here user-defined-attribute-string is a placeholder that can be replaced with any user defined string attribute name. * `attributes.projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/ attributes/user-defined-attribute-id.json_values.values` - The allowed value of the user defined JSON attribute associated with the Resource. Allowed comparison operator is `:`. Here user-defined-attribute-json is a placeholder that can be replaced with any user defined JSON attribute name. Expressions are combined with either `AND` logic operator or `OR` logical operator but not both of them together i.e. only one of the `AND` or `OR` operator can be used throughout the filter string and both the operators cannot be used together. No other logical operators are supported. At most three filter fields are allowed in the filter string and if provided more than that then `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned by the API. Here are a few examples: * `spec_type.enum_values.values.id: rest-id` - The filter string specifies that the id of the allowed value associated with the spec_type attribute is _rest-id_. * `spec_type.enum_values.values.display_name: \&quot;Rest Display Name\&quot;` - The filter string specifies that the display name of the allowed value associated with the spec_type attribute is `Rest Display Name`. * `spec_type.enum_values.values.id: grpc-id AND create_time &lt; \&quot;2021-08-15T14:50:00Z\&quot; AND create_time &gt; \&quot;2021-08-10T12:00:00Z\&quot;` - The id of the allowed value associated with the spec_type attribute is _grpc-id_ and the spec was created before _2021-08-15 14:50:00 UTC_ and after _2021-08-10 12:00:00 UTC_. * `spec_type.enum_values.values.id: rest-id OR spec_type.enum_values.values.id: grpc-id` - The id of the allowed value associated with the spec_type attribute is _rest-id_ or _grpc-id_. * `spec_type.enum_values.values.id: rest-id AND attributes.projects/test-project-id/locations/test-location-id/ attributes/17650f90-4a29-4971-b3c0-d5532da3764b.enum_values.values.id: test` - The filter string specifies that the id of the allowed value associated with the spec_type attribute is _rest-id_ and the id of the allowed value associated with the user defined attribute of type enum is _test_.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of specs to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 50 specs will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListSpecs` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListSpecs` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
