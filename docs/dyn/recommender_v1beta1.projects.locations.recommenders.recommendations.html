  <pre>Marks the Recommendation State as Failed. Users can use this method to
indicate to the Recommender API that they have applied the recommendation
themselves, and the operation failed. This stops the recommendation content
from being updated. Associated insights are frozen and placed in the
ACCEPTED state.

MarkRecommendationFailed can be applied to recommendations in ACTIVE,
CLAIMED, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED state.

Requires the recommender.*.update IAM permission for the specified
recommender.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the recommendation. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    &quot;stateMetadata&quot;: { # State properties to include with this state. Overwrites any existing
