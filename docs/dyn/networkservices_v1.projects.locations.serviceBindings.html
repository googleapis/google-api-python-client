<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, serviceBindingId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new ServiceBinding in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the ServiceBinding. Must be in the format `projects/*/locations/global`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # ServiceBinding is the resource that defines a Service Directory Service to be used in a BackendService resource.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A free-text description of the resource. Max length 1024 characters.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Set of label tags associated with the ServiceBinding resource.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. Name of the ServiceBinding resource. It matches pattern `projects/*/locations/global/serviceBindings/service_binding_name`.
  &quot;service&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The full Service Directory Service name of the format projects/*/locations/*/namespaces/*/services/*
  &quot;serviceId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of the Service Directory Service against which the Service Binding resource is validated. This is populated when the Service Binding resource is used in another resource (like Backend Service). This is of the UUID4 format.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was updated.
}

  serviceBindingId: string, Required. Short name of the ServiceBinding resource to be created.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
