  <pre>Grants the bind permission to the customer provided principal(user / service account) to bind their DNS zone with the intranet VPC associated with the project. DnsBindPermission is a global resource and location can only be global.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the resource which stores the users/service accounts having the permission to bind to the corresponding intranet VPC of the consumer project. DnsBindPermission is a global resource. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/global/dnsBindPermission` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for VmwareEngine.GrantDnsBindPermission
  &quot;principal&quot;: { # Users/Service accounts which have access for DNS binding on the intranet VPC corresponding to the consumer project. # Required. The consumer provided user/service account which needs to be granted permission to bind with the intranet VPC corresponding to the consumer project.
    &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The service account which needs to be granted the permission.
    &quot;user&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The user who needs to be granted permission.
  },
  &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

Returns:

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
