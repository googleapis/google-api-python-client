  <pre>Creates a new exclusion in a specified parent resource. Only log entries belonging to that resource can be excluded. You can have up to 10 exclusions in a resource.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource in which to create the exclusion: &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]&quot; &quot;organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]&quot; &quot;billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]&quot; &quot;folders/[FOLDER_ID]&quot; Examples: &quot;projects/my-logging-project&quot;, &quot;organizations/123456789&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Specifies a set of log entries that are not to be stored in Logging. If your GCP resource receives a large volume of logs, you can use exclusions to reduce your chargeable logs. Exclusions are processed after log sinks, so you can export log entries before they are excluded. Note that organization-level and folder-level exclusions don&#x27;t apply to child resources, and that you can&#x27;t exclude audit log entries.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The creation timestamp of the exclusion.This field may not be present for older exclusions.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of this exclusion.
  &quot;disabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If set to True, then this exclusion is disabled and it does not exclude any log entries. You can update an exclusion to change the value of this field.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries) that matches the log entries to be excluded. By using the sample function (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries#sample), you can exclude less than 100% of the matching log entries. For example, the following query matches 99% of low-severity log entries from Google Cloud Storage buckets:&quot;resource.type=gcs_bucket severity&lt;ERROR sample(insertId, 0.99)&quot;
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A client-assigned identifier, such as &quot;load-balancer-exclusion&quot;. Identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods. First character has to be alphanumeric.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last update timestamp of the exclusion.This field may not be present for older exclusions.
}
