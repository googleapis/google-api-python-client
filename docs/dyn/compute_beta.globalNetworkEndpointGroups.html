<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="attachNetworkEndpoints">attachNetworkEndpoints(project, networkEndpointGroup, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Attach a network endpoint to the specified network endpoint group.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  networkEndpointGroup: string, The name of the network endpoint group where you are attaching network endpoints to. It should comply with RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;networkEndpoints&quot;: [ # The list of network endpoints to be attached.
    { # The network endpoint.
      &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Metadata defined as annotations on the network endpoint.
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
      },
      &quot;fqdn&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional fully qualified domain name of network endpoint. This can only be specified when NetworkEndpointGroup.network_endpoint_type is NON_GCP_FQDN_PORT.
      &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name for a specific VM instance that the IP address belongs to. This is required for network endpoints of type GCE_VM_IP_PORT. The instance must be in the same zone of network endpoint group.
          #
          # The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      &quot;ipAddress&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional IPv4 address of network endpoint. The IP address must belong to a VM in Compute Engine (either the primary IP or as part of an aliased IP range). If the IP address is not specified, then the primary IP address for the VM instance in the network that the network endpoint group belongs to will be used.
      &quot;port&quot;: 42, # Optional port number of network endpoint. If not specified, the defaultPort for the network endpoint group will be used.
    },
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of network endpoint groups that are located in the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

  <pre>Lists the network endpoints in the specified network endpoint group.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  networkEndpointGroup: string, The name of the network endpoint group from which you want to generate a list of included network endpoints. It should comply with RFC1035. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.
