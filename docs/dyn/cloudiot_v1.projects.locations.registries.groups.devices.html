  <pre>List devices in a device registry.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The device registry path. Required. For example, `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/registries/my-registry`. (required)
  deviceIds: string, A list of device string IDs. For example, `[&#x27;device0&#x27;, &#x27;device12&#x27;]`. If empty, this field is ignored. Maximum IDs: 10,000 (repeated)
  deviceNumIds: string, A list of device numeric IDs. If empty, this field is ignored. Maximum IDs: 10,000. (repeated)
  fieldMask: string, The fields of the `Device` resource to be returned in the response. The fields `id` and `num_id` are always returned, along with any other fields specified in snake_case format, for example: `last_heartbeat_time`.
  gatewayListOptions_associationsDeviceId: string, If set, returns only the gateways with which the specified device is associated. The device ID can be numeric (`num_id`) or the user-defined string (`id`). For example, if `456` is specified, returns only the gateways to which the device with `num_id` 456 is bound.
  gatewayListOptions_associationsGatewayId: string, If set, only devices associated with the specified gateway are returned. The gateway ID can be numeric (`num_id`) or the user-defined string (`id`). For example, if `123` is specified, only devices bound to the gateway with `num_id` 123 are returned.
  gatewayListOptions_gatewayType: string, If `GATEWAY` is specified, only gateways are returned. If `NON_GATEWAY` is specified, only non-gateway devices are returned. If `GATEWAY_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED` is specified, all devices are returned.
    Allowed values
      GATEWAY_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED - If unspecified, the device is considered a non-gateway device.
      GATEWAY - The device is a gateway.
      NON_GATEWAY - The device is not a gateway.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of devices to return in the response. If this value is zero, the service will select a default size. A call may return fewer objects than requested. A non-empty `next_page_token` in the response indicates that more data is available.
  pageToken: string, The value returned by the last `ListDevicesResponse`; indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListDevices` call and the system should return the next page of data.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response for `ListDevices`.
  &quot;devices&quot;: [ # The devices that match the request.
    { # The device resource.
      &quot;blocked&quot;: True or False, # If a device is blocked, connections or requests from this device will fail. Can be used to temporarily prevent the device from connecting if, for example, the sensor is generating bad data and needs maintenance.
      &quot;config&quot;: { # The device configuration. Eventually delivered to devices. # The most recent device configuration, which is eventually sent from Cloud IoT Core to the device. If not present on creation, the configuration will be initialized with an empty payload and version value of `1`. To update this field after creation, use the `DeviceManager.ModifyCloudToDeviceConfig` method.
        &quot;binaryData&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The device configuration data.
        &quot;cloudUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output only] The time at which this configuration version was updated in Cloud IoT Core. This timestamp is set by the server.
        &quot;deviceAckTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output only] The time at which Cloud IoT Core received the acknowledgment from the device, indicating that the device has received this configuration version. If this field is not present, the device has not yet acknowledged that it received this version. Note that when the config was sent to the device, many config versions may have been available in Cloud IoT Core while the device was disconnected, and on connection, only the latest version is sent to the device. Some versions may never be sent to the device, and therefore are never acknowledged. This timestamp is set by Cloud IoT Core.
        &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output only] The version of this update. The version number is assigned by the server, and is always greater than 0 after device creation. The version must be 0 on the `CreateDevice` request if a `config` is specified; the response of `CreateDevice` will always have a value of 1.
      },
      &quot;credentials&quot;: [ # The credentials used to authenticate this device. To allow credential rotation without interruption, multiple device credentials can be bound to this device. No more than 3 credentials can be bound to a single device at a time. When new credentials are added to a device, they are verified against the registry credentials. For details, see the description of the `DeviceRegistry.credentials` field.
        { # A server-stored device credential used for authentication.
          &quot;expirationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The time at which this credential becomes invalid. This credential will be ignored for new client authentication requests after this timestamp; however, it will not be automatically deleted.
          &quot;publicKey&quot;: { # A public key format and data. # A public key used to verify the signature of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). When adding a new device credential, either via device creation or via modifications, this public key credential may be required to be signed by one of the registry level certificates. More specifically, if the registry contains at least one certificate, any new device credential must be signed by one of the registry certificates. As a result, when the registry contains certificates, only X.509 certificates are accepted as device credentials. However, if the registry does not contain a certificate, self-signed certificates and public keys will be accepted. New device credentials must be different from every registry-level certificate.
            &quot;format&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The format of the key.
            &quot;key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key data.

      &quot;lastConfigAckTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output only] The last time a cloud-to-device config version acknowledgment was received from the device. This field is only for configurations sent through MQTT.
      &quot;lastConfigSendTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output only] The last time a cloud-to-device config version was sent to the device.
      &quot;lastErrorStatus&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # [Output only] The error message of the most recent error, such as a failure to publish to Cloud Pub/Sub. &#x27;last_error_time&#x27; is the timestamp of this field. If no errors have occurred, this field has an empty message and the status code 0 == OK. Otherwise, this field is expected to have a status code other than OK.

      },
      &quot;lastErrorTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output only] The time the most recent error occurred, such as a failure to publish to Cloud Pub/Sub. This field is the timestamp of &#x27;last_error_status&#x27;.
      &quot;lastEventTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output only] The last time a telemetry event was received. Timestamps are periodically collected and written to storage; they may be stale by a few minutes.
      &quot;lastHeartbeatTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output only] The last time an MQTT `PINGREQ` was received. This field applies only to devices connecting through MQTT. MQTT clients usually only send `PINGREQ` messages if the connection is idle, and no other messages have been sent. Timestamps are periodically collected and written to storage; they may be stale by a few minutes.
      &quot;lastStateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output only] The last time a state event was received. Timestamps are periodically collected and written to storage; they may be stale by a few minutes.

It can be used to add contextual information for the device. Keys must conform to the regular expression a-zA-Z+ and be less than 128 bytes in length. Values are free-form strings. Each value must be less than or equal to 32 KB in size. The total size of all keys and values must be less than 256 KB, and the maximum number of key-value pairs is 500.
