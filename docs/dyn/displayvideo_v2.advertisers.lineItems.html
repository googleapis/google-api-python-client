Example: If set to `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM`, the bid price will be based on the probability that each available impression will be viewable. For example, if viewable CPM target is $2 and an impression is 40% likely to be viewable, the bid price will be $0.80 CPM (40% of $2).
