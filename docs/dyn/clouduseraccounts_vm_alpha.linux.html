<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#getAuthorizedKeysView">getAuthorizedKeysView(project, zone, user, instance, login=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns a list of authorized public keys for a specific user account.</p>

<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getAuthorizedKeysView">getAuthorizedKeysView(project, zone, user, instance, login=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns a list of authorized public keys for a specific user account.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, Name of the zone for this request. (required)
  user: string, The user account for which you want to get a list of authorized public keys. (required)
  instance: string, The fully-qualified URL of the virtual machine requesting the view. (required)
  login: boolean, Whether the view was requested as part of a user-initiated login.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "resource": { # A list of authorized public keys for a user account. # [Output Only] A list of authorized public keys for a user.
      "keys": [ # [Output Only] The list of authorized public keys in SSH format.
        "A String",
      ],
      "sudoer": True or False, # [Output Only] Whether the user has the ability to elevate on the instance that requested the authorized keys.
    },
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getLinuxAccountViews">getLinuxAccountViews(project, zone, instance, orderBy=None, filter=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of user accounts for an instance within a specific project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, Name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, The fully-qualified URL of the virtual machine requesting the views. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.

The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

Returns:
  An object of the form:
