  <pre>Creates a Data Asset.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource where this Data Asset will be created. Format: projects/{project_id_or_number}/locations/{location_id}/dataProducts/{data_product_id} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a Data Asset resource that can be packaged and shared via a Data Product.
  &quot;accessGroupConfigs&quot;: { # Optional. Access groups configurations for this Data Asset. The key is DataProduct.AccessGroup.id and the value is AccessGroupConfig. Example: key: &quot;analyst&quot; value: { AccessGroupConfig : { iam_roles : &quot;roles/bigquery.dataViewer&quot; } } Currently, at most one IAM role is allowed per access group. For providing multiple predefined IAM roles, wrap them in a custom IAM role as per https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles.
