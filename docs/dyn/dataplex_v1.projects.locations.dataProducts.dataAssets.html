  <pre>Creates a data asset.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource where this data asset will be created. Format: projects/{project_id_or_number}/locations/{location_id}/dataProducts/{data_product_id} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a data asset resource that can be packaged and shared via a data product.
