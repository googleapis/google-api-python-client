<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="activate">activate(beaconName, projectId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Activates a beacon. A beacon that is active will return information
and attachment data when queried via `beaconinfo.getforobserved`.
Calling this method on an already active beacon will do nothing (but
will return a successful response code).

Authenticate using an [OAuth access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
from a signed-in user with **Is owner** or **Can edit** permissions in the
Google Developers Console project.

Args:
  beaconName: string, Beacon that should be activated. A beacon name has the format
"beacons/N!beaconId" where the beaconId is the base16 ID broadcast by
the beacon and N is a code for the beacon's type. Possible values are
`3` for Eddystone-UID, `4` for Eddystone-EID, `1` for iBeacon, or `5`
for AltBeacon. For Eddystone-EID beacons, you may use either the
current EID or the beacon's "stable" UID.
Required. (required)
  projectId: string, The project id of the beacon to activate. If the project id is not
specified then the project making the request is used. The project id
must match the project that owns the beacon.
Optional.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

        # field must contain an ID of type Eddystone-UID. Any other ID type will
        # result in an error.
        # Two ways of securely registering an Eddystone-EID beacon with the service
        # are supported:
        #
        # 1. Perform an ECDH key exchange via this API, including a previous call
        #    to `GET /v1beta1/eidparams`. In this case the fields
        #    `beacon_ecdh_public_key` and `service_ecdh_public_key` should be
        #    populated and `beacon_identity_key` should not be populated. This
        #    method ensures that only the two parties in the ECDH key exchange can
        #    compute the identity key, which becomes a secret between them.
        # 2. Derive or obtain the beacon's identity key via other secure means
        #    (perhaps an ECDH key exchange between the beacon and a mobile device
        #    or any other secure method), and then submit the resulting identity key
        #    to the service. In this case `beacon_identity_key` field should be
        #    populated, and neither of `beacon_ecdh_public_key` nor
        #    `service_ecdh_public_key` fields should be. The security of this method
        #    depends on how securely the parties involved (in particular the
        #    bluetooth client) handle the identity key, and obviously on how
        #    securely the identity key was generated.

  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of records to return for this request, up to a
server-defined upper limit.
  pageToken: string, A pagination token obtained from a previous request to list beacons.
  projectId: string, The project id to list beacons under. If not present then the project
credential that made the request is used as the project.
Optional.
  q: string, Filter query string that supports the following field filters:

* **description:`"<string>"`**
  For example: **description:"Room 3"**
  Returns beacons whose description matches tokens in the string "Room 3"
  (not necessarily that exact string).
  The string must be double-quoted.
* **status:`<enum>`**
  For example: **status:active**
  Returns beacons whose status matches the given value. Values must be
  one of the Beacon.Status enum values (case insensitive). Accepts
  multiple filters which will be combined with OR logic.
* **stability:`<enum>`**
  For example: **stability:mobile**
  Returns beacons whose expected stability matches the given value.
  Values must be one of the Beacon.Stability enum values (case
  insensitive). Accepts multiple filters which will be combined with
  OR logic.
* **place\_id:`"<string>"`**
  For example: **place\_id:"ChIJVSZzVR8FdkgRXGmmm6SslKw="**
  Returns beacons explicitly registered at the given place, expressed as
  a Place ID obtained from [Google Places API](/places/place-id). Does not
  match places inside the given place. Does not consider the beacon's
  actual location (which may be different from its registered place).
  Accepts multiple filters that will be combined with OR logic. The place
  ID must be double-quoted.
* **registration\_time`[<|>|<=|>=]<integer>`**
  For example: **registration\_time>=1433116800**
  Returns beacons whose registration time matches the given filter.
  Supports the operators: <, >, <=, and >=. Timestamp must be expressed as
  an integer number of seconds since midnight January 1, 1970 UTC. Accepts
  at most two filters that will be combined with AND logic, to support
  "between" semantics. If more than two are supplied, the latter ones are
  ignored.
* **lat:`<double> lng:<double> radius:<integer>`**
  For example: **lat:51.1232343 lng:-1.093852 radius:1000**
  Returns beacons whose registered location is within the given circle.
  When any of these fields are given, all are required. Latitude and
  longitude must be decimal degrees between -90.0 and 90.0 and between
  -180.0 and 180.0 respectively. Radius must be an integer number of
  meters between 10 and 1,000,000 (1000 km).
* **property:`"<string>=<string>"`**
  For example: **property:"battery-type=CR2032"**
  Returns beacons which have a property of the given name and value.
  Supports multiple filters which will be combined with OR logic.
  The entire name=value string must be double-quoted as one string.
* **attachment\_type:`"<string>"`**
  For example: **attachment_type:"my-namespace/my-type"**
  Returns beacons having at least one attachment of the given namespaced
  type. Supports "any within this namespace" via the partial wildcard
  syntax: "my-namespace/*". Supports multiple filters which will be
  combined with OR logic. The string must be double-quoted.
* **indoor\_level:`"<string>"`**
  For example: **indoor\_level:"1"**
  Returns beacons which are located on the given indoor level. Accepts
  multiple filters that will be combined with OR logic.

Multiple filters on the same field are combined with OR logic (except
registration_time which is combined with AND logic).
Multiple filters on different fields are combined with AND logic.
Filters should be separated by spaces.

As with any HTTP query string parameter, the whole filter expression must

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(beaconName, body, projectId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the information about the specified beacon. **Any field that you do
not populate in the submitted beacon will be permanently erased**, so you
should follow the "read, modify, write" pattern to avoid inadvertently
destroying data.

Changes to the beacon status via this method will be  silently ignored.
To update beacon status, use the separate methods on this API for
activation, deactivation, and decommissioning.
Authenticate using an [OAuth access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
from a signed-in user with **Is owner** or **Can edit** permissions in the
Google Developers Console project.

Args:
  beaconName: string, Resource name of this beacon. A beacon name has the format
"beacons/N!beaconId" where the beaconId is the base16 ID broadcast by
the beacon and N is a code for the beacon's type. Possible values are
`3` for Eddystone, `1` for iBeacon, or `5` for AltBeacon.

This field must be left empty when registering. After reading a beacon,
clients can use the name for future operations. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Details of a beacon device.
  "status": "A String", # Current status of the beacon.
      # Required.
  "description": "A String", # Free text used to identify and describe the beacon. Maximum length 140
      # characters.
      # Optional.
  "indoorLevel": { # Indoor level, a human-readable string as returned by Google Maps APIs, # The indoor level information for this beacon, if known. As returned by the
      # Google Maps API.
      # Optional.
      # useful to indicate which floor of a building a beacon is located on.
    "name": "A String", # The name of this level.
  },
  "latLng": { # An object representing a latitude/longitude pair. This is expressed as a pair # The location of the beacon, expressed as a latitude and longitude pair.
      # This location is given when the beacon is registered or updated. It does
      # not necessarily indicate the actual current location of the beacon.
      # Optional.
      # of doubles representing degrees latitude and degrees longitude. Unless
      # specified otherwise, this must conform to the
      # <a href="http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/icg/2012/template/WGS_84.pdf">WGS84
      # standard</a>. Values must be within normalized ranges.
    "latitude": 3.14, # The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].
    "longitude": 3.14, # The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].
  },
  "placeId": "A String", # The [Google Places API](/places/place-id) Place ID of the place where
      # the beacon is deployed. This is given when the beacon is registered or
      # updated, not automatically detected in any way.
      # Optional.
  "ephemeralIdRegistration": { # Write-only registration parameters for beacons using Eddystone-EID format. # Write-only registration parameters for beacons using Eddystone-EID
      # (remotely resolved ephemeral ID) format. This information will not be
      # populated in API responses. When submitting this data, the `advertised_id`
      # field must contain an ID of type Eddystone-UID. Any other ID type will
      # result in an error.
      # Two ways of securely registering an Eddystone-EID beacon with the service
      # are supported:
      #
      # 1. Perform an ECDH key exchange via this API, including a previous call
      #    to `GET /v1beta1/eidparams`. In this case the fields
      #    `beacon_ecdh_public_key` and `service_ecdh_public_key` should be
      #    populated and `beacon_identity_key` should not be populated. This
      #    method ensures that only the two parties in the ECDH key exchange can
      #    compute the identity key, which becomes a secret between them.
      # 2. Derive or obtain the beacon's identity key via other secure means
      #    (perhaps an ECDH key exchange between the beacon and a mobile device
      #    or any other secure method), and then submit the resulting identity key
      #    to the service. In this case `beacon_identity_key` field should be
      #    populated, and neither of `beacon_ecdh_public_key` nor
      #    `service_ecdh_public_key` fields should be. The security of this method
      #    depends on how securely the parties involved (in particular the
      #    bluetooth client) handle the identity key, and obviously on how
      #    securely the identity key was generated.
