  <pre>Creates a Redis instance based on the specified tier and memory size. By default, the instance is accessible from the project&#x27;s [default network](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc). The creation is executed asynchronously and callers may check the returned operation to track its progress. Once the operation is completed the Redis instance will be fully functional. Completed longrunning.Operation will contain the new instance object in the response field. The returned operation is automatically deleted after a few hours, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the instance location using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}` where `location_id` refers to a GCP region. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Google Cloud Redis instance.
  &quot;alternativeLocationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Only applicable to STANDARD_HA tier which protects the instance against zonal failures by provisioning it across two zones. If provided, it must be a different zone from the one provided in location_id.
  &quot;authEnabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether OSS Redis AUTH is enabled for the instance. If set to &quot;true&quot; AUTH is enabled on the instance. Default value is &quot;false&quot; meaning AUTH is disabled.
  &quot;authorizedNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The full name of the Google Compute Engine [network](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc) to which the instance is connected. If left unspecified, the `default` network will be used.

  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the instance was created.
  &quot;currentLocationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current zone where the Redis endpoint is placed. For Basic Tier instances, this will always be the same as the location_id provided by the user at creation time. For Standard Tier instances, this can be either location_id or alternative_location_id and can change after a failover event.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An arbitrary and optional user-provided name for the instance.
  &quot;host&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Hostname or IP address of the exposed Redis endpoint used by clients to connect to the service.

    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;locationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The zone where the instance will be provisioned. If not provided, the service will choose a zone for the instance.

Unique name of the resource in this scope including project and location using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}` Note: Redis instances are managed and addressed at regional level so location_id here refers to a GCP region; however, users may choose which specific zone (or collection of zones for cross-zone instances) an instance should be provisioned in. Refer to location_id and alternative_location_id fields for more details.
  &quot;persistenceIamIdentity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Cloud IAM identity used by import / export operations to transfer data to/from Cloud Storage. Format is &quot;serviceAccount:&quot;. The value may change over time for a given instance so should be checked before each import/export operation.

  &quot;reservedIpRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. For DIRECT_PEERING mode, the CIDR range of internal addresses that are reserved for this instance. Range must be unique and non-overlapping with existing subnets in an authorized network. For PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS mode, the name of one allocated IP address ranges associated with this private service access connection. If not provided, the service will choose an unused /29 block, for example, 10.0.0.0/29 or 192.168.0.0/29.
  &quot;serverCaCerts&quot;: [ # Output only. List of server CA certificates for the instance.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="upgrade">upgrade(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Upgrades Redis instance to the newer Redis version specified in the request.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Redis instance resource name using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}` where `location_id` refers to a GCP region. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for UpgradeInstance.
  &quot;redisVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Specifies the target version of Redis software to upgrade to.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
