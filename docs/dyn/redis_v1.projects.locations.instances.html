<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, instanceId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a Redis instance based on the specified tier and memory size.

By default, the instance is accessible from the project&#x27;s
[default network](/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks).

The creation is executed asynchronously and callers may check the returned
operation to track its progress. Once the operation is completed the Redis
instance will be fully functional. Completed longrunning.Operation will
contain the new instance object in the response field.

The returned operation is automatically deleted after a few hours, so there
is no need to call DeleteOperation.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the instance location using the form:
    `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}`
where `location_id` refers to a GCP region. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Google Cloud Redis instance.
    &quot;statusMessage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Additional information about the current status of this
        # instance, if available.
    &quot;authorizedNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The full name of the Google Compute Engine
        # [network](/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks) to which the
        # instance is connected. If left unspecified, the `default` network
        # will be used.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of this instance.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Unique name of the resource in this scope including project and

        #     `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
        # 
        # Note: Redis instances are managed and addressed at regional level so
        # location_id here refers to a GCP region; however, users may choose which
        # specific zone (or collection of zones for cross-zone instances) an instance
        # should be provisioned in. Refer to location_id and
        # alternative_location_id fields for more details.
    &quot;connectMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The network connect mode of the Redis instance.

        # transfer data to/from Cloud Storage. Format is
        # &quot;serviceAccount:&lt;service_account_email&gt;&quot;. The value may change over time
        # for a given instance so should be checked before each import/export
        # operation.
    &quot;redisConfigs&quot;: { # Optional. Redis configuration parameters, according to
        # http://redis.io/topics/config. Currently, the only supported parameters

        # change after a failover event.
    &quot;alternativeLocationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Only applicable to STANDARD_HA tier which protects the instance
        # against zonal failures by provisioning it across two zones. If provided, it

    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the metadata and configuration of a specific Redis instance.

Completed longrunning.Operation will contain the new instance object
in the response field. The returned operation is automatically deleted
after a few hours, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Unique name of the resource in this scope including project and
location using the form:
    `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`

Note: Redis instances are managed and addressed at regional level so
location_id here refers to a GCP region; however, users may choose which
specific zone (or collection of zones for cross-zone instances) an instance
should be provisioned in. Refer to location_id and
alternative_location_id fields for more details. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

        # different from location_id.
    &quot;reservedIpRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The CIDR range of internal addresses that are reserved for this

        # this can be either location_id or alternative_location_id and can
        # change after a failover event.
    &quot;alternativeLocationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Only applicable to STANDARD_HA tier which protects the instance
        # against zonal failures by provisioning it across two zones. If provided, it
        # must be a different zone from the one provided in location_id.
