Implementations SHOULD ensure that any blobs referenced from the ContentAddressableStorage are available at the time of returning the ActionResult and will be for some period of time afterwards. The lifetimes of the referenced blobs SHOULD be increased if necessary and applicable. Errors: * `NOT_FOUND`: The requested `ActionResult` is not in the cache.

Args:
  instanceName: string, The instance of the execution system to operate against. A server may support multiple instances of the execution system (with their own workers, storage, caches, etc.). The server MAY require use of this field to select between them in an implementation-defined fashion, otherwise it can be omitted. (required)
  hash: string, The hash. In the case of SHA-256, it will always be a lowercase hex string exactly 64 characters long. (required)
  sizeBytes: string, The size of the blob, in bytes. (required)
  inlineOutputFiles: string, A hint to the server to inline the contents of the listed output files. Each path needs to exactly match one file path in either `output_paths` or `output_files` (DEPRECATED since v2.1) in the Command message. (repeated)
  inlineStderr: boolean, A hint to the server to request inlining stderr in the ActionResult message.
  inlineStdout: boolean, A hint to the server to request inlining stdout in the ActionResult message.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An ActionResult represents the result of an Action being run. It is advised that at least one field (for example `ActionResult.execution_metadata.Worker`) have a non-default value, to ensure that the serialized value is non-empty, which can then be used as a basic data sanity check.
  &quot;executionMetadata&quot;: { # ExecutedActionMetadata contains details about a completed execution. # The details of the execution that originally produced this result.
    &quot;auxiliaryMetadata&quot;: [ # Details that are specific to the kind of worker used. For example, on POSIX-like systems this could contain a message with getrusage(2) statistics.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.

    &quot;inputFetchCompletedTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When the worker finished fetching action inputs.
    &quot;inputFetchStartTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When the worker started fetching action inputs.
    &quot;outputUploadCompletedTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When the worker finished uploading action outputs.
    &quot;outputUploadStartTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When the worker started uploading action outputs.
    &quot;queuedTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When was the action added to the queue.
    &quot;worker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the worker which ran the execution.
    &quot;workerCompletedTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When the worker completed the action, including all stages.
    &quot;workerStartTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When the worker received the action.
  },
  &quot;exitCode&quot;: 42, # The exit code of the command.
  &quot;outputDirectories&quot;: [ # The output directories of the action. For each output directory requested in the `output_directories` or `output_paths` field of the Action, if the corresponding directory existed after the action completed, a single entry will be present in the output list, which will contain the digest of a Tree message containing the directory tree, and the path equal exactly to the corresponding Action output_directories member. As an example, suppose the Action had an output directory `a/b/dir` and the execution produced the following contents in `a/b/dir`: a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz`. Then, output_directory will contain (hashes shortened for readability): ```json // OutputDirectory proto: { path: &quot;a/b/dir&quot; tree_digest: { hash: &quot;4a73bc9d03...&quot;, size: 55 } } // Tree proto with hash &quot;4a73bc9d03...&quot; and size 55: { root: { files: [ { name: &quot;bar&quot;, digest: { hash: &quot;4a73bc9d03...&quot;, size: 65534 } } ], directories: [ { name: &quot;foo&quot;, digest: { hash: &quot;4cf2eda940...&quot;, size: 43 } } ] } children : { // (Directory proto with hash &quot;4cf2eda940...&quot; and size 43) files: [ { name: &quot;baz&quot;, digest: { hash: &quot;b2c941073e...&quot;, size: 1294, }, is_executable: true } ] } } ``` If an output of the same name as listed in `output_files` of the Command was found in `output_directories`, but was not a directory, the server will return a FAILED_PRECONDITION.
    { # An `OutputDirectory` is the output in an `ActionResult` corresponding to a directory&#x27;s full contents rather than a single file.
      &quot;path&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full path of the directory relative to the working directory. The path separator is a forward slash `/`. Since this is a relative path, it MUST NOT begin with a leading forward slash. The empty string value is allowed, and it denotes the entire working directory.
      &quot;treeDigest&quot;: { # A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server. The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request. The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff. When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message: * Fields are serialized in tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type. Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance, concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields. # The digest of the encoded Tree proto containing the directory&#x27;s contents.
        &quot;hash&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The hash. In the case of SHA-256, it will always be a lowercase hex string exactly 64 characters long.
