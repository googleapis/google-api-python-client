  <pre>Create a new domain mapping.

Args:
  parent: string, The namespace in which the domain mapping should be created. For Cloud Run (fully managed), replace {namespace_id} with the project ID or number. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Resource to hold the state and status of a user&#x27;s domain mapping. NOTE: This resource is currently in Beta.
  &quot;apiVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The API version for this call such as &quot;domains.cloudrun.com/v1&quot;.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The kind of resource, in this case &quot;DomainMapping&quot;.
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # k8s.io.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. # Metadata associated with this BuildTemplate.
    &quot;annotations&quot;: { # (Optional) Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
    &quot;clusterName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # (Optional) Cloud Run fully managed: not supported Cloud Run for Anthos: supported The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.
    &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # (Optional) CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata
    &quot;deletionGracePeriodSeconds&quot;: 42, # (Optional) Cloud Run fully managed: not supported Cloud Run for Anthos: supported Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
    &quot;deletionTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # (Optional) Cloud Run fully managed: not supported Cloud Run for Anthos: supported DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server. If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).
