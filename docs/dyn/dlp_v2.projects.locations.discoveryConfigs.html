  <pre>Creates a config for discovery to scan and profile storage.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. The format of this value varies depending on the scope of the request (project or organization): + Projects scope: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}` + Organizations scope: `organizations/{org_id}/locations/{location_id}` The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CreateDiscoveryConfig.
  &quot;configId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The config ID can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens; that is, it must match the regular expression: `[a-zA-Z\d-_]+`. The maximum length is 100 characters. Can be empty to allow the system to generate one.
  &quot;discoveryConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for discovery to scan resources for profile generation. Only one discovery configuration may exist per organization, folder, or project. The generated data profiles are retained according to the [data retention policy] (https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/data-profiles#retention). # Required. The DiscoveryConfig to create.
    &quot;actions&quot;: [ # Actions to execute at the completion of scanning.
      { # A task to execute when a data profile has been generated.
        &quot;exportData&quot;: { # If set, the detailed data profiles will be persisted to the location of your choice whenever updated. # Export data profiles into a provided location.
          &quot;profileTable&quot;: { # Message defining the location of a BigQuery table. A table is uniquely identified by its project_id, dataset_id, and table_name. Within a query a table is often referenced with a string in the format of: `:.` or `..`. # Store all profiles to BigQuery. * The system will create a new dataset and table for you if none are are provided. The dataset will be named `sensitive_data_protection_discovery` and table will be named `discovery_profiles`. This table will be placed in the same project as the container project running the scan. The configuration will be updated with the fields set after the first profile is generated and the dataset and table are created. * See [Analyze data profiles stored in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/analyze-data-profiles) * See [Sample queries for your BigQuery table](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/analyze-data-profiles#sample_sql_queries). * Data is inserted using [streaming insert](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/bigquery/life-of-a-bigquery-streaming-insert) and so data may be in the buffer for a period of time after the profile has finished. * The Pub/Sub notification is sent before the streaming buffer is guaranteed to be written, so data may not be instantly visible to queries by the time your topic receives the Pub/Sub notification. * The best practice is to use the same table for an entire organization so that you can take advantage of the provided Looker reports. If you use VPC Service Controls to define security perimeters, then you must use a separate table for each boundary.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists discovery configurations.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. The format of this value is as follows: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}` The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  orderBy: string, Comma-separated list of config fields to order by, followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case insensitive. The default sorting order is ascending. Redundant space characters are insignificant. Example: `name asc,update_time, create_time desc` Supported fields are: - `last_run_time`: corresponds to the last time the DiscoveryConfig ran. - `name`: corresponds to the DiscoveryConfig&#x27;s name. - `status`: corresponds to DiscoveryConfig&#x27;s status.
  pageSize: integer, Size of the page. This value can be limited by a server.
  pageToken: string, Page token to continue retrieval. Comes from the previous call to ListDiscoveryConfigs. `order_by` field must not change for subsequent calls.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
