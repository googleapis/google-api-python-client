  <pre>Creates a config for discovery to scan and profile storage.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. The format of this value varies depending on the scope of the request (project or organization): + Projects scope: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}` + Organizations scope: `organizations/{org_id}/locations/{location_id}` The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CreateDiscoveryConfig.
  &quot;configId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The config ID can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens; that is, it must match the regular expression: `[a-zA-Z\d-_]+`. The maximum length is 100 characters. Can be empty to allow the system to generate one.

Within a query a table is often referenced with a string in the format of: `:.` or `..`. # Store all table and column profiles in an existing table or a new table in an existing dataset. Each re-generation will result in new rows in BigQuery. Data is inserted using [streaming insert](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/bigquery/life-of-a-bigquery-streaming-insert) and so data may be in the buffer for a period of time after the profile has finished. The Pub/Sub notification is sent before the streaming buffer is guaranteed to be written, so data may not be instantly visible to queries by the time your topic receives the Pub/Sub notification.
            &quot;datasetId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Dataset ID of the table.
            &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Google Cloud Platform project ID of the project containing the table. If omitted, project ID is inferred from the API call.

          &quot;event&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of event that triggers a Pub/Sub. At most one `PubSubNotification` per EventType is permitted.
          &quot;pubsubCondition&quot;: { # A condition for determining whether a Pub/Sub should be triggered. # Conditions (e.g., data risk or sensitivity level) for triggering a Pub/Sub.

          &quot;lowerDataRiskToLow&quot;: True or False, # Whether applying a tag to a resource should lower the risk of the profile for that resource. For example, in conjunction with an [IAM deny policy](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/deny-overview), you can deny all principals a permission if a tag value is present, mitigating the risk of the resource. This also lowers the data risk of resources at the lower levels of the resource hierarchy. For example, reducing the data risk of a table data profile also reduces the data risk of the constituent column data profiles.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists discovery configurations.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. The format of this value is as follows: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}` The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  orderBy: string, Comma-separated list of config fields to order by, followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case insensitive. The default sorting order is ascending. Redundant space characters are insignificant. Example: `name asc,update_time, create_time desc` Supported fields are: - `last_run_time`: corresponds to the last time the DiscoveryConfig ran. - `name`: corresponds to the DiscoveryConfig&#x27;s name. - `status`: corresponds to DiscoveryConfig&#x27;s status.
  pageSize: integer, Size of the page. This value can be limited by a server.
  pageToken: string, Page token to continue retrieval. Comes from the previous call to ListDiscoveryConfigs. `order_by` field must not change for subsequent calls.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
