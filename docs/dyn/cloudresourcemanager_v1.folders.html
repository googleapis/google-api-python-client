<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="clearOrgPolicy">clearOrgPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Clears a `Policy` from a resource.

Args:
  resource: string, Name of the resource for the `Policy` to clear. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to the ClearOrgPolicy method.
  &quot;constraint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the `Constraint` of the `Policy` to clear.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The current version, for concurrency control. Not sending an `etag` will cause the `Policy` to be cleared blindly.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.

    <code class="details" id="getEffectiveOrgPolicy">getEffectiveOrgPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the effective `Policy` on a resource. This is the result of merging `Policies` in the resource hierarchy. The returned `Policy` will not have an `etag`set because it is a computed `Policy` across multiple resources. Subtrees of Resource Manager resource hierarchy with &#x27;under:&#x27; prefix will not be expanded.

Args:
  resource: string, The name of the resource to start computing the effective `Policy`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to the GetEffectiveOrgPolicy method.
  &quot;constraint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the `Constraint` to compute the effective `Policy`.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Defines a Cloud Organization `Policy` which is used to specify `Constraints` for configurations of Cloud Platform resources.
  &quot;booleanPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `boolean_policy` will behave at this resource. # For boolean `Constraints`, whether to enforce the `Constraint` or not.
    &quot;enforced&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, then the `Policy` is enforced. If `false`, then any configuration is acceptable. Suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced. Example 3 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.
  },
  &quot;constraint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the `Constraint` the `Policy` is configuring, for example, `constraints/serviceuser.services`. A [list of available constraints](/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) is available. Immutable after creation.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An opaque tag indicating the current version of the `Policy`, used for concurrency control. When the `Policy` is returned from either a `GetPolicy` or a `ListOrgPolicy` request, this `etag` indicates the version of the current `Policy` to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset. When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the `etag`in a `SetOrgPolicy` request will result in an unconditional write of the `Policy`.
  &quot;listPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - &quot;projects/&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot; - &quot;folders/&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot; - &quot;organizations/&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot; The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset. # List of values either allowed or disallowed.
    &quot;allValues&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The policy all_values state.

      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;deniedValues&quot;: [ # List of values denied at this resource. Can only be set if `all_values` is set to `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`. By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.
    &quot;suggestedValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The Google Cloud Console will try to default to a configuration that matches the value specified in this `Policy`. If `suggested_value` is not set, it will inherit the value specified higher in the hierarchy, unless `inherit_from_parent` is `false`.
  },
  &quot;restoreDefault&quot;: { # Ignores policies set above this resource and restores the `constraint_default` enforcement behavior of the specific `Constraint` at this resource. Suppose that `constraint_default` is set to `ALLOW` for the `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`. Suppose that organization foo.com sets a `Policy` at their Organization resource node that restricts the allowed service activations to deny all service activations. They could then set a `Policy` with the `policy_type` `restore_default` on several experimental projects, restoring the `constraint_default` enforcement of the `Constraint` for only those projects, allowing those projects to have all services activated. # Restores the default behavior of the constraint; independent of `Constraint` type.
  },
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time stamp the `Policy` was previously updated. This is set by the server, not specified by the caller, and represents the last time a call to `SetOrgPolicy` was made for that `Policy`. Any value set by the client will be ignored.

Suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced. Example 3 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.

When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset. When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the `etag`in a `SetOrgPolicy` request will result in an unconditional write of the `Policy`.
      &quot;listPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - &quot;projects/&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot; - &quot;folders/&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot; - &quot;organizations/&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot; The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset. # List of values either allowed or disallowed.

By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Defines a Cloud Organization `Policy` which is used to specify `Constraints` for configurations of Cloud Platform resources.
  &quot;booleanPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `boolean_policy` will behave at this resource. # For boolean `Constraints`, whether to enforce the `Constraint` or not.
    &quot;enforced&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, then the `Policy` is enforced. If `false`, then any configuration is acceptable. Suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced. Example 3 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.
  },
  &quot;constraint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the `Constraint` the `Policy` is configuring, for example, `constraints/serviceuser.services`. A [list of available constraints](/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) is available. Immutable after creation.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An opaque tag indicating the current version of the `Policy`, used for concurrency control. When the `Policy` is returned from either a `GetPolicy` or a `ListOrgPolicy` request, this `etag` indicates the version of the current `Policy` to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset. When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the `etag`in a `SetOrgPolicy` request will result in an unconditional write of the `Policy`.
  &quot;listPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - &quot;projects/&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot; - &quot;folders/&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot; - &quot;organizations/&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot; The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset. # List of values either allowed or disallowed.
    &quot;allValues&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The policy all_values state.
    &quot;allowedValues&quot;: [ # List of values allowed at this resource. Can only be set if `all_values` is set to `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;deniedValues&quot;: [ # List of values denied at this resource. Can only be set if `all_values` is set to `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`. By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.
    &quot;suggestedValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The Google Cloud Console will try to default to a configuration that matches the value specified in this `Policy`. If `suggested_value` is not set, it will inherit the value specified higher in the hierarchy, unless `inherit_from_parent` is `false`.
