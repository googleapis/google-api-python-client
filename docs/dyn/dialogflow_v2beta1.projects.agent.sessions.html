<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="deleteContexts">deleteContexts(parent, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes all active contexts in the specified session.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the session to delete all contexts from. Format:
`projects/&lt;Project ID&gt;/agent/sessions/&lt;Session ID&gt;` or `projects/&lt;Project
ID&gt;/agent/environments/&lt;Environment ID&gt;/users/&lt;User ID&gt;/sessions/&lt;Session
ID&gt;`. If `Environment ID` is not specified we assume default 'draft'
environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default '-' user. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="detectIntent">detectIntent(session, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Processes a natural language query and returns structured, actionable data
as a result. This method is not idempotent, because it may cause contexts
and session entity types to be updated, which in turn might affect
results of future queries.

Args:
  session: string, Required. The name of the session this query is sent to. Format:
`projects/&lt;Project ID&gt;/agent/sessions/&lt;Session ID&gt;`, or
`projects/&lt;Project ID&gt;/agent/environments/&lt;Environment ID&gt;/users/&lt;User
ID&gt;/sessions/&lt;Session ID&gt;`. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume
default 'draft' environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we are using
"-". It's up to the API caller to choose an appropriate `Session ID` and
`User Id`. They can be a random number or some type of user and session
identifiers (preferably hashed). The length of the `Session ID` and
`User ID` must not exceed 36 characters. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

            # to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for
            # any value greater than that.
        "pitch": 3.14, # Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20
