(see [Viewing logs](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.

      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints

        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
