  <pre>Creates a new reservation resource.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Project, location. E.g., `projects/myproject/locations/US` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A reservation is a mechanism used to guarantee slots to users.
  &quot;autoscale&quot;: { # Auto scaling settings. # Optional. The configuration parameters for the auto scaling feature.
    &quot;currentSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The slot capacity added to this reservation when autoscale happens. Will be between [0, max_slots]. Note: after users reduce max_slots, it may take a while before it can be propagated, so current_slots may stay in the original value and could be larger than max_slots for that brief period (less than one minute)
    &quot;maxSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Number of slots to be scaled when needed.
  },
  &quot;concurrency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Job concurrency target which sets a soft upper bound on the number of jobs that can run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft target due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency target will be automatically computed by the system. NOTE: this field is exposed as target job concurrency in the Information Schema, DDL and BigQuery CLI.
  &quot;creationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of the reservation.
  &quot;edition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Edition of the reservation.
  &quot;ignoreIdleSlots&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If false, any query or pipeline job using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within the same admin project. If true, a query or pipeline job using this reservation will execute with the slot capacity specified in the slot_capacity field at most.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. The labels associated with this reservation. You can use these to organize and group your reservations. You can set this property when you create or update a reservation.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;maxSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The overall max slots for the reservation, covering slot_capacity (baseline), idle slots (if ignore_idle_slots is false) and scaled slots. If present, the reservation won&#x27;t use more than the specified number of slots, even if there is demand and supply (from idle slots). NOTE: capping a reservation&#x27;s idle slot usage is best effort and its usage may exceed the max_slots value. However, in terms of autoscale.current_slots (which accounts for the additional added slots), it will never exceed the max_slots - baseline. This field must be set together with the scaling_mode enum value, otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, the autoscale or autoscale.max_slots field must be unset. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. However, the autoscale field may still be in the output. The autopscale.max_slots will always show as 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will represent the current slots from autoscaler excluding idle slots. For example, if the max_slots is 1000 and scaling_mode is AUTOSCALE_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots may be any value between 0 and 1000. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is ALL_SLOTS, the baseline is 100 and idle slots usage is 200, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will not be higher than 700. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler field will be null. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, then the ignore_idle_slots field must be aligned with the scaling_mode enum value.(See details in ScalingMode comments). Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note, the max_slots is for user to manage the part of slots greater than the baseline. Therefore, we don&#x27;t allow users to set max_slots smaller or equal to the baseline as it will not be meaningful. If the field is present and slot_capacity&gt;=max_slots, requests will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note that if max_slots is set to 0, we will treat it as unset. Customers can set max_slots to 0 and set scaling_mode to SCALING_MODE_UNSPECIFIED to disable the max_slots feature.
  &quot;multiRegionAuxiliary&quot;: True or False, # Applicable only for reservations located within one of the BigQuery multi-regions (US or EU). If set to true, this reservation is placed in the organization&#x27;s secondary region which is designated for disaster recovery purposes. If false, this reservation is placed in the organization&#x27;s default region. NOTE: this is a preview feature. Project must be allow-listed in order to set this field.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The resource name of the reservation, e.g., `projects/*/locations/*/reservations/team1-prod`. The reservation_id must only contain lower case alphanumeric characters or dashes. It must start with a letter and must not end with a dash. Its maximum length is 64 characters.
  &quot;originalPrimaryLocation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The location where the reservation was originally created. This is set only during the failover reservation&#x27;s creation. All billing charges for the failover reservation will be applied to this location.
  &quot;primaryLocation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current location of the reservation&#x27;s primary replica. This field is only set for reservations using the managed disaster recovery feature.
  &quot;replicationStatus&quot;: { # Disaster Recovery(DR) replication status of the reservation. # Output only. The Disaster Recovery(DR) replication status of the reservation. This is only available for the primary replicas of DR/failover reservations and provides information about the both the staleness of the secondary and the last error encountered while trying to replicate changes from the primary to the secondary. If this field is blank, it means that the reservation is either not a DR reservation or the reservation is a DR secondary or that any replication operations on the reservation have succeeded.
    &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Output only. The last error encountered while trying to replicate changes from the primary to the secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not succeeded since.
      &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {
          &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
    },
    &quot;lastErrorTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the last error was encountered while trying to replicate changes from the primary to the secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not succeeded since.
    &quot;lastReplicationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A timestamp corresponding to the last change on the primary that was successfully replicated to the secondary.
    &quot;softFailoverStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which a soft failover for the reservation and its associated datasets was initiated. After this field is set, all subsequent changes to the reservation will be rejected unless a hard failover overrides this operation. This field will be cleared once the failover is complete.
  },
  &quot;reservationGroup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The reservation group that this reservation belongs to. You can set this property when you create or update a reservation. Reservations do not need to belong to a reservation group. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/reservationGroups/{reservation_group} or just {reservation_group}
  &quot;scalingMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The scaling mode for the reservation. If the field is present but max_slots is not present, requests will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
  &quot;schedulingPolicy&quot;: { # The scheduling policy controls how a reservation&#x27;s resources are distributed. # Optional. The scheduling policy to use for jobs and queries running under this reservation. The scheduling policy controls how the reservation&#x27;s resources are distributed. This feature is not yet generally available.
    &quot;concurrency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. If present and &gt; 0, the reservation will attempt to limit the concurrency of jobs running for any particular project within it to the given value. This feature is not yet generally available.
    &quot;maxSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. If present and &gt; 0, the reservation will attempt to limit the slot consumption of queries running for any particular project within it to the given value. This feature is not yet generally available.
  },
  &quot;secondaryLocation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The current location of the reservation&#x27;s secondary replica. This field is only set for reservations using the managed disaster recovery feature. Users can set this in create reservation calls to create a failover reservation or in update reservation calls to convert a non-failover reservation to a failover reservation(or vice versa).
  &quot;slotCapacity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Baseline slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the unit of parallelism. Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignore_idle_slots is set to false, or autoscaling is enabled. The total slot_capacity of the reservation and its siblings may exceed the total slot_count of capacity commitments. In that case, the exceeding slots will be charged with the autoscale SKU. You can increase the number of baseline slots in a reservation every few minutes. If you want to decrease your baseline slots, you are limited to once an hour if you have recently changed your baseline slot capacity and your baseline slots exceed your committed slots. Otherwise, you can decrease your baseline slots every few minutes.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of the reservation.
}

  reservationId: string, The reservation ID. It must only contain lower case alphanumeric characters or dashes. It must start with a letter and must not end with a dash. Its maximum length is 64 characters.

    &quot;maxSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Number of slots to be scaled when needed.
  },
  &quot;concurrency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Job concurrency target which sets a soft upper bound on the number of jobs that can run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft target due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency target will be automatically computed by the system. NOTE: this field is exposed as target job concurrency in the Information Schema, DDL and BigQuery CLI.

  &quot;maxSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The overall max slots for the reservation, covering slot_capacity (baseline), idle slots (if ignore_idle_slots is false) and scaled slots. If present, the reservation won&#x27;t use more than the specified number of slots, even if there is demand and supply (from idle slots). NOTE: capping a reservation&#x27;s idle slot usage is best effort and its usage may exceed the max_slots value. However, in terms of autoscale.current_slots (which accounts for the additional added slots), it will never exceed the max_slots - baseline. This field must be set together with the scaling_mode enum value, otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, the autoscale or autoscale.max_slots field must be unset. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. However, the autoscale field may still be in the output. The autopscale.max_slots will always show as 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will represent the current slots from autoscaler excluding idle slots. For example, if the max_slots is 1000 and scaling_mode is AUTOSCALE_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots may be any value between 0 and 1000. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is ALL_SLOTS, the baseline is 100 and idle slots usage is 200, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will not be higher than 700. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler field will be null. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, then the ignore_idle_slots field must be aligned with the scaling_mode enum value.(See details in ScalingMode comments). Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note, the max_slots is for user to manage the part of slots greater than the baseline. Therefore, we don&#x27;t allow users to set max_slots smaller or equal to the baseline as it will not be meaningful. If the field is present and slot_capacity&gt;=max_slots, requests will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note that if max_slots is set to 0, we will treat it as unset. Customers can set max_slots to 0 and set scaling_mode to SCALING_MODE_UNSPECIFIED to disable the max_slots feature.

May return: * A`NOT_FOUND` error if the resource doesn&#x27;t exist or you don&#x27;t have the permission to view it. * An empty policy if the resource exists but doesn&#x27;t have a set policy. Supported resources are: - Reservations - ReservationAssignments To call this method, you must have the following Google IAM permissions: - `bigqueryreservation.reservations.getIamPolicy` to get policies on reservations.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  options_requestedPolicyVersion: integer, Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.

See the service documentation for additional information. # The condition that is associated with this binding. If the condition evaluates to `true`, then this binding applies to the current request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this binding.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Token to retrieve the next page of results, or empty if there are no more results in the list.
  &quot;reservations&quot;: [ # List of reservations visible to the user.
    { # A reservation is a mechanism used to guarantee slots to users.
      &quot;autoscale&quot;: { # Auto scaling settings. # Optional. The configuration parameters for the auto scaling feature.
        &quot;currentSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The slot capacity added to this reservation when autoscale happens. Will be between [0, max_slots]. Note: after users reduce max_slots, it may take a while before it can be propagated, so current_slots may stay in the original value and could be larger than max_slots for that brief period (less than one minute)
        &quot;maxSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Number of slots to be scaled when needed.
      },
      &quot;concurrency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Job concurrency target which sets a soft upper bound on the number of jobs that can run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft target due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency target will be automatically computed by the system. NOTE: this field is exposed as target job concurrency in the Information Schema, DDL and BigQuery CLI.
      &quot;creationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of the reservation.
      &quot;edition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Edition of the reservation.
      &quot;ignoreIdleSlots&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If false, any query or pipeline job using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within the same admin project. If true, a query or pipeline job using this reservation will execute with the slot capacity specified in the slot_capacity field at most.
      &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. The labels associated with this reservation. You can use these to organize and group your reservations. You can set this property when you create or update a reservation.
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,

      &quot;maxSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The overall max slots for the reservation, covering slot_capacity (baseline), idle slots (if ignore_idle_slots is false) and scaled slots. If present, the reservation won&#x27;t use more than the specified number of slots, even if there is demand and supply (from idle slots). NOTE: capping a reservation&#x27;s idle slot usage is best effort and its usage may exceed the max_slots value. However, in terms of autoscale.current_slots (which accounts for the additional added slots), it will never exceed the max_slots - baseline. This field must be set together with the scaling_mode enum value, otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, the autoscale or autoscale.max_slots field must be unset. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. However, the autoscale field may still be in the output. The autopscale.max_slots will always show as 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will represent the current slots from autoscaler excluding idle slots. For example, if the max_slots is 1000 and scaling_mode is AUTOSCALE_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots may be any value between 0 and 1000. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is ALL_SLOTS, the baseline is 100 and idle slots usage is 200, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will not be higher than 700. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler field will be null. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, then the ignore_idle_slots field must be aligned with the scaling_mode enum value.(See details in ScalingMode comments). Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note, the max_slots is for user to manage the part of slots greater than the baseline. Therefore, we don&#x27;t allow users to set max_slots smaller or equal to the baseline as it will not be meaningful. If the field is present and slot_capacity&gt;=max_slots, requests will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note that if max_slots is set to 0, we will treat it as unset. Customers can set max_slots to 0 and set scaling_mode to SCALING_MODE_UNSPECIFIED to disable the max_slots feature.

      },
      &quot;reservationGroup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The reservation group that this reservation belongs to. You can set this property when you create or update a reservation. Reservations do not need to belong to a reservation group. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/reservationGroups/{reservation_group} or just {reservation_group}
      &quot;scalingMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The scaling mode for the reservation. If the field is present but max_slots is not present, requests will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

      &quot;slotCapacity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Baseline slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the unit of parallelism. Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignore_idle_slots is set to false, or autoscaling is enabled. The total slot_capacity of the reservation and its siblings may exceed the total slot_count of capacity commitments. In that case, the exceeding slots will be charged with the autoscale SKU. You can increase the number of baseline slots in a reservation every few minutes. If you want to decrease your baseline slots, you are limited to once an hour if you have recently changed your baseline slot capacity and your baseline slots exceed your committed slots. Otherwise, you can decrease your baseline slots every few minutes.

  &quot;schedulingPolicy&quot;: { # The scheduling policy controls how a reservation&#x27;s resources are distributed. # Optional. The scheduling policy to use for jobs and queries running under this reservation. The scheduling policy controls how the reservation&#x27;s resources are distributed. This feature is not yet generally available.
    &quot;concurrency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. If present and &gt; 0, the reservation will attempt to limit the concurrency of jobs running for any particular project within it to the given value. This feature is not yet generally available.

  },
  &quot;secondaryLocation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The current location of the reservation&#x27;s secondary replica. This field is only set for reservations using the managed disaster recovery feature. Users can set this in create reservation calls to create a failover reservation or in update reservation calls to convert a non-failover reservation to a failover reservation(or vice versa).
  &quot;slotCapacity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Baseline slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the unit of parallelism. Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignore_idle_slots is set to false, or autoscaling is enabled. The total slot_capacity of the reservation and its siblings may exceed the total slot_count of capacity commitments. In that case, the exceeding slots will be charged with the autoscale SKU. You can increase the number of baseline slots in a reservation every few minutes. If you want to decrease your baseline slots, you are limited to once an hour if you have recently changed your baseline slot capacity and your baseline slots exceed your committed slots. Otherwise, you can decrease your baseline slots every few minutes.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of the reservation.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A reservation is a mechanism used to guarantee slots to users.
  &quot;autoscale&quot;: { # Auto scaling settings. # Optional. The configuration parameters for the auto scaling feature.
    &quot;currentSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The slot capacity added to this reservation when autoscale happens. Will be between [0, max_slots]. Note: after users reduce max_slots, it may take a while before it can be propagated, so current_slots may stay in the original value and could be larger than max_slots for that brief period (less than one minute)
    &quot;maxSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Number of slots to be scaled when needed.
  },
  &quot;concurrency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Job concurrency target which sets a soft upper bound on the number of jobs that can run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft target due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency target will be automatically computed by the system. NOTE: this field is exposed as target job concurrency in the Information Schema, DDL and BigQuery CLI.
  &quot;creationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of the reservation.
  &quot;edition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Edition of the reservation.
  &quot;ignoreIdleSlots&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If false, any query or pipeline job using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within the same admin project. If true, a query or pipeline job using this reservation will execute with the slot capacity specified in the slot_capacity field at most.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. The labels associated with this reservation. You can use these to organize and group your reservations. You can set this property when you create or update a reservation.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;maxSlots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The overall max slots for the reservation, covering slot_capacity (baseline), idle slots (if ignore_idle_slots is false) and scaled slots. If present, the reservation won&#x27;t use more than the specified number of slots, even if there is demand and supply (from idle slots). NOTE: capping a reservation&#x27;s idle slot usage is best effort and its usage may exceed the max_slots value. However, in terms of autoscale.current_slots (which accounts for the additional added slots), it will never exceed the max_slots - baseline. This field must be set together with the scaling_mode enum value, otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, the autoscale or autoscale.max_slots field must be unset. Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. However, the autoscale field may still be in the output. The autopscale.max_slots will always show as 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will represent the current slots from autoscaler excluding idle slots. For example, if the max_slots is 1000 and scaling_mode is AUTOSCALE_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots may be any value between 0 and 1000. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is ALL_SLOTS, the baseline is 100 and idle slots usage is 200, then in the output, the autoscaler.max_slots will be 0 and the autoscaler.current_slots will not be higher than 700. If the max_slots is 1000, scaling_mode is IDLE_SLOTS_ONLY, then in the output, the autoscaler field will be null. If the max_slots and scaling_mode are set, then the ignore_idle_slots field must be aligned with the scaling_mode enum value.(See details in ScalingMode comments). Otherwise the request will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note, the max_slots is for user to manage the part of slots greater than the baseline. Therefore, we don&#x27;t allow users to set max_slots smaller or equal to the baseline as it will not be meaningful. If the field is present and slot_capacity&gt;=max_slots, requests will be rejected with error code `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`. Please note that if max_slots is set to 0, we will treat it as unset. Customers can set max_slots to 0 and set scaling_mode to SCALING_MODE_UNSPECIFIED to disable the max_slots feature.
  &quot;multiRegionAuxiliary&quot;: True or False, # Applicable only for reservations located within one of the BigQuery multi-regions (US or EU). If set to true, this reservation is placed in the organization&#x27;s secondary region which is designated for disaster recovery purposes.

  <pre>Sets an access control policy for a resource. Replaces any existing policy. Supported resources are: - Reservations To call this method, you must have the following Google IAM permissions: - `bigqueryreservation.reservations.setIamPolicy` to set policies on reservations.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`. The size of the policy is limited to a few 10s of KB. An empty policy is a valid policy but certain Google Cloud services (such as Projects) might reject them.
    &quot;auditConfigs&quot;: [ # Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;auditConfigs&quot;: [ # Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    { # Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs: { &quot;audit_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;allServices&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:jose@example.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;ADMIN_READ&quot; } ] }, { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;sampleservice.googleapis.com&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:aliya@example.com&quot; ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.
      &quot;auditLogConfigs&quot;: [ # The configuration for logging of each type of permission.

Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
