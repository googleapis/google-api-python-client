Args:
  parent: string, Required. Project and location in which the workflow should be created. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],

    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;callLogLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Describes the level of platform logging to apply to calls and call responses during executions of this workflow. If both the workflow and the execution specify a logging level, the execution level takes precedence.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp for when the workflow was created. This is a workflow-wide field and is not tied to a specific revision.
  &quot;cryptoKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The resource name of a KMS crypto key used to encrypt or decrypt the data associated with the workflow. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyRing}/cryptoKeys/{cryptoKey} Using `-` as a wildcard for the `{project}` or not providing one at all will infer the project from the account. If not provided, data associated with the workflow will not be CMEK-encrypted.
  &quot;cryptoKeyVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of a KMS crypto key version used to encrypt or decrypt the data associated with the workflow. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyRing}/cryptoKeys/{cryptoKey}/cryptoKeyVersions/{cryptoKeyVersion}
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Description of the workflow provided by the user. Must be at most 1000 Unicode characters long. This is a workflow-wide field and is not tied to a specific revision.
