{ # An instance of a Schedule periodically schedules runs to make API calls based on user specified time specification and API request type.
  &quot;allowQueueing&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether new scheduled runs can be queued when max_concurrent_runs limit is reached. If set to true, new runs will be queued instead of skipped. Default to false.
  &quot;catchUp&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Whether to backfill missed runs when the schedule is resumed from PAUSED state. If set to true, all missed runs will be scheduled. New runs will be scheduled after the backfill is complete. Default to false.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Schedules in a Location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the Location to list the Schedules from. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  filter: string, Lists the Schedules that match the filter expression. The following fields are supported: * `display_name`: Supports `=`, `!=` comparisons, and `:` wildcard. * `state`: Supports `=` and `!=` comparisons. * `request`: Supports existence of the check. (e.g. `create_pipeline_job_request:*` --&gt; Schedule has create_pipeline_job_request). * `create_time`: Supports `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, and `&gt;=` comparisons. Values must be in RFC 3339 format. * `start_time`: Supports `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, and `&gt;=` comparisons. Values must be in RFC 3339 format. * `end_time`: Supports `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` comparisons and `:*` existence check. Values must be in RFC 3339 format. * `next_run_time`: Supports `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, and `&gt;=` comparisons. Values must be in RFC 3339 format. Filter expressions can be combined together using logical operators (`NOT`, `AND` &amp; `OR`). The syntax to define filter expression is based on https://google.aip.dev/160. Examples: * `state=&quot;ACTIVE&quot; AND display_name:&quot;my_schedule_*&quot;` * `NOT display_name=&quot;my_schedule&quot;` * `create_time&gt;&quot;2021-05-18T00:00:00Z&quot;` * `end_time&gt;&quot;2021-05-18T00:00:00Z&quot; OR NOT end_time:*` * `create_pipeline_job_request:*`
  orderBy: string, A comma-separated list of fields to order by. The default sort order is in ascending order. Use &quot;desc&quot; after a field name for descending. You can have multiple order_by fields provided. For example, using &quot;create_time desc, end_time&quot; will order results by create time in descending order, and if there are multiple schedules having the same create time, order them by the end time in ascending order. If order_by is not specified, it will order by default with create_time in descending order. Supported fields: * `create_time` * `start_time` * `end_time` * `next_run_time`
  pageSize: integer, The standard list page size. Default to 100 if not specified.
  pageToken: string, The standard list page token. Typically obtained via ListSchedulesResponse.next_page_token of the previous ScheduleService.ListSchedules call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

      1 - v1 error format

  <pre>Pauses a Schedule. Will mark Schedule.state to &#x27;PAUSED&#x27;. If the schedule is paused, no new runs will be created. Already created runs will NOT be paused or canceled.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the Schedule resource to be paused. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/schedules/{schedule}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

</div>

<div class="method">

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
