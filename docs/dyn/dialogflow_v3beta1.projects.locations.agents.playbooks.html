  <pre>Creates a playbook in a specified agent.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The agent to create a playbook for. Format: `projects//locations//agents/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Playbook is the basic building block to instruct the LLM how to execute a certain task. A playbook consists of a goal to accomplish, an optional list of step by step instructions (the step instruction may refers to name of the custom or default plugin tools to use) to perform the task, a list of contextual input data to be passed in at the beginning of the invoked, and a list of output parameters to store the playbook result.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp of initial playbook creation.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human-readable name of the playbook, unique within an agent.
  &quot;goal&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. High level description of the goal the playbook intend to accomplish. A goal should be concise since it&#x27;s visible to other playbooks that may reference this playbook.
  &quot;handlers&quot;: [ # Optional. A list of registered handlers to execute based on the specified triggers.
    { # Handler can be used to define custom logic to be executed based on the user-specified triggers.
      &quot;eventHandler&quot;: { # A handler that is triggered by the specified event. # A handler triggered by event.
        &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The condition that must be satisfied to trigger this handler.
        &quot;event&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the event that triggers this handler.
        &quot;fulfillment&quot;: { # A fulfillment can do one or more of the following actions at the same time: * Generate rich message responses. * Set parameter values. * Call the webhook. Fulfillments can be called at various stages in the Page or Form lifecycle. For example, when a DetectIntentRequest drives a session to enter a new page, the page&#x27;s entry fulfillment can add a static response to the QueryResult in the returning DetectIntentResponse, call the webhook (for example, to load user data from a database), or both. # Required. The fulfillment to call when the event occurs.
          &quot;advancedSettings&quot;: { # Hierarchical advanced settings for agent/flow/page/fulfillment/parameter. Settings exposed at lower level overrides the settings exposed at higher level. Overriding occurs at the sub-setting level. For example, the playback_interruption_settings at fulfillment level only overrides the playback_interruption_settings at the agent level, leaving other settings at the agent level unchanged. DTMF settings does not override each other. DTMF settings set at different levels define DTMF detections running in parallel. Hierarchy: Agent-&gt;Flow-&gt;Page-&gt;Fulfillment/Parameter. # Hierarchical advanced settings for this fulfillment. The settings exposed at the lower level overrides the settings exposed at the higher level.
            &quot;audioExportGcsDestination&quot;: { # Google Cloud Storage location for a Dialogflow operation that writes or exports objects (e.g. exported agent or transcripts) outside of Dialogflow. # If present, incoming audio is exported by Dialogflow to the configured Google Cloud Storage destination.

              &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The Google Cloud Storage URI for the exported objects. A URI is of the form: `gs://bucket/object-name-or-prefix` Whether a full object name, or just a prefix, its usage depends on the Dialogflow operation.

              &quot;enabled&quot;: True or False, # If true, incoming audio is processed for DTMF (dual tone multi frequency) events. For example, if the caller presses a button on their telephone keypad and DTMF processing is enabled, Dialogflow will detect the event (e.g. a &quot;3&quot; was pressed) in the incoming audio and pass the event to the bot to drive business logic (e.g. when 3 is pressed, return the account balance).
              &quot;endpointingTimeoutDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Endpoint timeout setting for matching dtmf input to regex.
              &quot;finishDigit&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The digit that terminates a DTMF digit sequence.

DTMF settings does not override each other. DTMF settings set at different levels define DTMF detections running in parallel.
