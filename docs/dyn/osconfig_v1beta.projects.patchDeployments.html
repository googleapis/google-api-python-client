The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.
      &quot;fixed&quot;: 42, # Specifies a fixed value.
      &quot;percent&quot;: 42, # Specifies the relative value defined as a percentage, which will be multiplied by a reference value.

}

  patchDeploymentId: string, Required. A name for the patch deployment in the project. When creating a name the following rules apply: * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. * Must start with a letter. * Must be between 1-63 characters. * Must end with a number or a letter. * Must be unique within the project.

The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.

The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.

During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed.

The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.

The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.

        &quot;weekOrdinal&quot;: 42, # Required. Week number in a month. 1-4 indicates the 1st to 4th week of the month. -1 indicates the last week of the month.
      },
    },
    &quot;nextExecuteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the next patch job is scheduled to run.
    &quot;startTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The time that the recurring schedule becomes effective. Defaults to `create_time` of the patch deployment.
    &quot;timeOfDay&quot;: { # Represents a time of day. The date and time zone are either not significant or are specified elsewhere. An API may choose to allow leap seconds. Related types are google.type.Date and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # Required. Time of the day to run a recurring deployment.
      &quot;hours&quot;: 42, # Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23. An API may choose to allow the value &quot;24:00:00&quot; for scenarios like business closing time.
      &quot;minutes&quot;: 42, # Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59.
      &quot;nanos&quot;: 42, # Fractions of seconds in nanoseconds. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999.
      &quot;seconds&quot;: 42, # Seconds of minutes of the time. Must normally be from 0 to 59. An API may allow the value 60 if it allows leap-seconds.
    },
    &quot;timeZone&quot;: { # Represents a time zone from the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). # Required. Defines the time zone that `time_of_day` is relative to. The rules for daylight saving time are determined by the chosen time zone.
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # IANA Time Zone Database time zone, e.g. &quot;America/New_York&quot;.
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. IANA Time Zone Database version number, e.g. &quot;2019a&quot;.
    },
    &quot;weekly&quot;: { # Represents a weekly schedule. # Required. Schedule with weekly executions.
      &quot;dayOfWeek&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Day of the week.
    },
  },
  &quot;rollout&quot;: { # Patch rollout configuration specifications. Contains details on the concurrency control when applying patch(es) to all targeted VMs. # Optional. Rollout strategy of the patch job.
    &quot;disruptionBudget&quot;: { # Message encapsulating a value that can be either absolute (&quot;fixed&quot;) or relative (&quot;percent&quot;) to a value. # The maximum number (or percentage) of VMs per zone to disrupt at any given moment. The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.
      &quot;fixed&quot;: 42, # Specifies a fixed value.
      &quot;percent&quot;: 42, # Specifies the relative value defined as a percentage, which will be multiplied by a reference value.
    },
    &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Mode of the patch rollout.
  },
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Current state of the patch deployment.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time the patch deployment was last updated. Timestamp is in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format.
