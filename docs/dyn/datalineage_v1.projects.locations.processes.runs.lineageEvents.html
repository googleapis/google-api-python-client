Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the run that should own the lineage event. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A lineage event represents an operation on assets. Within the operation, the data flows from the source to the target defined in the links field.
  &quot;endTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The end of the transformation which resulted in this lineage event. For streaming scenarios, it should be the end of the period from which the lineage is being reported.
  &quot;links&quot;: [ # Optional. List of source-target pairs. Can&#x27;t contain more than 100 tuples.
    { # A lineage between source and target entities.
      &quot;source&quot;: { # The soft reference to everything you can attach a lineage event to. # Required. Reference to the source entity
        &quot;fullyQualifiedName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. [Fully Qualified Name (FQN)](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/fully-qualified-names) of the entity.
