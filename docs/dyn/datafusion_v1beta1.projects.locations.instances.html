  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

Args:
  name: string, Name of the Data Fusion instance which need to be upgraded in the form of
projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}
Instance will be upgraded with the latest stable version of the Data
Fusion. (required)
