<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addSignedUrlKey">addSignedUrlKey(project, backendService, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds a key for validating requests with signed URLs for this backend service.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  backendService: string, Name of the BackendService resource to which the Signed URL Key should be added. The name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a customer-supplied Signing Key used by Cloud CDN Signed URLs
  &quot;keyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the key. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  &quot;keyValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # 128-bit key value used for signing the URL. The key value must be a valid RFC 4648 Section 5 base64url encoded string.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents an Operation resource. Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zoneOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources. Note that completed Operation resources have a limited retention period.
  &quot;clientOperationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The value of `requestId` if you provided it in the request. Not present otherwise.
  &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Deprecated] This field is deprecated.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A textual description of the operation, which is set when the operation is created.

Also, they must be limited to 64 characters in length. When identifying the current value of an exceeded limit, the units should be contained in the key, not the value. For example, rather than `{&quot;instanceLimit&quot;: &quot;100/request&quot;}`, should be returned as, `{&quot;instanceLimitPerRequest&quot;: &quot;100&quot;}`, if the client exceeds the number of instances that can be created in a single (batch) request.

    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, filter=None, includeAllScopes=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, serviceProjectNumber=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of all BackendService resources, regional and global, available to the specified project. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

Args:
  project: string, Name of the project scoping this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.
  includeAllScopes: boolean, Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code.

The backend service configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the settings have default values that allow for easy configuration if you need to get started quickly. Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped. * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/backendServices) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionBackendServices) For more information, see Backend Services.

The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these headers will not be cached at Google&#x27;s edge, and will require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached. If no value is provided for cdnPolicy.cacheMode, it defaults to CACHE_ALL_STATIC.
            &quot;clientTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
            &quot;defaultTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
            &quot;maxTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.

This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s.

Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1 week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.

Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate traffic by percentage using externalManagedMigrationTestingPercentage. Rolling back a migration requires the states to be set in reverse order. So changing the scheme from EXTERNAL_MANAGED to EXTERNAL requires the state to be set to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC at the same time. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate some traffic back to EXTERNAL or PREPARE can be used to migrate all traffic back to EXTERNAL.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(project, backendService, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the specified BackendService resource.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  backendService: string, Name of the BackendService resource to delete. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    { # Represents a Backend Service resource. A backend service defines how Google Cloud load balancers distribute traffic. The backend service configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the settings have default values that allow for easy configuration if you need to get started quickly. Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped. * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/backendServices) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionBackendServices) For more information, see Backend Services.

This setting is applicable to Application Load Balancers and Traffic Director and requires GENERATED_COOKIE or HTTP_COOKIE session affinity. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The maximum allowed value is two weeks (1,209,600).

For more information, see Supported balancing modes and target capacity settings and Restrictions and guidance for instance groups. Note: Currently, if you use the API to configure incompatible balancing modes, the configuration might be accepted even though it has no impact and is ignored. Specifically, Backend.maxUtilization is ignored when Backend.balancingMode is RATE. In the future, this incompatible combination will be rejected.
      &quot;capacityScaler&quot;: 3.14, # A multiplier applied to the backend&#x27;s target capacity of its balancing mode. The default value is 1, which means the group serves up to 100% of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available capacity. The valid ranges are 0.0 and [0.1,1.0]. You cannot configure a setting larger than 0 and smaller than 0.1. You cannot configure a setting of 0 when there is only one backend attached to the backend service. Not available with backends that don&#x27;t support using a balancingMode.

    &quot;cacheMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these headers will not be cached at Google&#x27;s edge, and will require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached. If no value is provided for cdnPolicy.cacheMode, it defaults to CACHE_ALL_STATIC.

With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
    &quot;defaultTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;maxTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;negativeCaching&quot;: True or False, # Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in negative_caching_policy.
    &quot;negativeCachingPolicy&quot;: [ # Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN&#x27;s default cache TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

The backend service configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the settings have default values that allow for easy configuration if you need to get started quickly. Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped. * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/backendServices) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionBackendServices) For more information, see Backend Services.

For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).

Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;maxTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;negativeCaching&quot;: True or False, # Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.

When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in negative_caching_policy.

Omitting the policy and leaving negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN&#x27;s default cache TTLs.

Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1 week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.

If not set, this feature is considered disabled. Results of the outlier detection algorithm (ejection of endpoints from the load balancing pool and returning them back to the pool) are executed independently by each proxy instance of the load balancer. In most cases, more than one proxy instance handles the traffic received by a backend service. Thus, it is possible that an unhealthy endpoint is detected and ejected by only some of the proxies, and while this happens, other proxies may continue to send requests to the same unhealthy endpoint until they detect and eject the unhealthy endpoint. Applicable backend endpoints can be: - VM instances in an Instance Group - Endpoints in a Zonal NEG (GCE_VM_IP, GCE_VM_IP_PORT) - Endpoints in a Hybrid Connectivity NEG (NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT) - Serverless NEGs, that resolve to Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Functions Services - Private Service Connect NEGs, that resolve to Google-managed regional API endpoints or managed services published using Private Service Connect Applicable backend service types can be: - A global backend service with the loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. - A regional backend service with the serviceProtocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Not supported for Serverless NEGs. Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.

Defaults to 30000ms or 30s. After a backend endpoint is returned back to the load balancing pool, it can be ejected again in another ejection analysis.

If the number of backend endpoints is fewer than this setting, outlier detection via success rate statistics is not performed for any backend endpoint in the load balancing pool. Defaults to 5. Not supported when the backend service uses Serverless NEG.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of BackendService resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents a Backend Service resource. A backend service defines how Google Cloud load balancers distribute traffic. The backend service configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the settings have default values that allow for easy configuration if you need to get started quickly. Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped. * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/backendServices) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionBackendServices) For more information, see Backend Services.

For more information, see Supported balancing modes and target capacity settings and Restrictions and guidance for instance groups. Note: Currently, if you use the API to configure incompatible balancing modes, the configuration might be accepted even though it has no impact and is ignored. Specifically, Backend.maxUtilization is ignored when Backend.balancingMode is RATE. In the future, this incompatible combination will be rejected.
          &quot;capacityScaler&quot;: 3.14, # A multiplier applied to the backend&#x27;s target capacity of its balancing mode. The default value is 1, which means the group serves up to 100% of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available capacity. The valid ranges are 0.0 and [0.1,1.0]. You cannot configure a setting larger than 0 and smaller than 0.1. You cannot configure a setting of 0 when there is only one backend attached to the backend service. Not available with backends that don&#x27;t support using a balancingMode.

The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these headers will not be cached at Google&#x27;s edge, and will require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached. If no value is provided for cdnPolicy.cacheMode, it defaults to CACHE_ALL_STATIC.
        &quot;clientTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
        &quot;defaultTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
        &quot;maxTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
        &quot;negativeCaching&quot;: True or False, # Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s.

This setting defines the default &quot;max-stale&quot; duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1 week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="listUsable">listUsable(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of all usable backend services in the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents a Backend Service resource. A backend service defines how Google Cloud load balancers distribute traffic. The backend service configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the settings have default values that allow for easy configuration if you need to get started quickly. Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped. * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/backendServices) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionBackendServices) For more information, see Backend Services.

FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached. If no value is provided for cdnPolicy.cacheMode, it defaults to CACHE_ALL_STATIC.
        &quot;clientTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
        &quot;defaultTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
        &quot;maxTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
        &quot;negativeCaching&quot;: True or False, # Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in negative_caching_policy.

Omitting the policy and leaving negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN&#x27;s default cache TTLs.

Results of the outlier detection algorithm (ejection of endpoints from the load balancing pool and returning them back to the pool) are executed independently by each proxy instance of the load balancer. In most cases, more than one proxy instance handles the traffic received by a backend service. Thus, it is possible that an unhealthy endpoint is detected and ejected by only some of the proxies, and while this happens, other proxies may continue to send requests to the same unhealthy endpoint until they detect and eject the unhealthy endpoint. Applicable backend endpoints can be: - VM instances in an Instance Group - Endpoints in a Zonal NEG (GCE_VM_IP, GCE_VM_IP_PORT) - Endpoints in a Hybrid Connectivity NEG (NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT) - Serverless NEGs, that resolve to Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Functions Services - Private Service Connect NEGs, that resolve to Google-managed regional API endpoints or managed services published using Private Service Connect Applicable backend service types can be: - A global backend service with the loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. - A regional backend service with the serviceProtocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Not supported for Serverless NEGs. Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.

Defaults to 30000ms or 30s. After a backend endpoint is returned back to the load balancing pool, it can be ejected again in another ejection analysis.

The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these headers will not be cached at Google&#x27;s edge, and will require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.

With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present.

Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses.

Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;.

When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setEdgeSecurityPolicy">setEdgeSecurityPolicy(project, backendService, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the edge security policy for the specified backend service.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  backendService: string, Name of the BackendService resource to which the edge security policy should be set. The name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;securityPolicy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zoneOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources. Note that completed Operation resources have a limited retention period.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

    <code class="details" id="setSecurityPolicy">setSecurityPolicy(project, backendService, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the Google Cloud Armor security policy for the specified backend service. For more information, see Google Cloud Armor Overview

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  backendService: string, Name of the BackendService resource to which the security policy should be set. The name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;securityPolicy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS).

For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present.

This is the default. - LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests. - RING_HASH: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests. - RANDOM: The load balancer selects a random healthy host. - ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load balancer. - MAGLEV: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times. For more information about Maglev, see https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824 This field is applicable to either: - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, INTERNAL_MANAGED, or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. If sessionAffinity is not configured—that is, if session affinity remains at the default value of NONE—then the default value for localityLbPolicy is ROUND_ROBIN. If session affinity is set to a value other than NONE, then the default value for localityLbPolicy is MAGLEV. Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.

If not set, this feature is considered disabled. Results of the outlier detection algorithm (ejection of endpoints from the load balancing pool and returning them back to the pool) are executed independently by each proxy instance of the load balancer. In most cases, more than one proxy instance handles the traffic received by a backend service. Thus, it is possible that an unhealthy endpoint is detected and ejected by only some of the proxies, and while this happens, other proxies may continue to send requests to the same unhealthy endpoint until they detect and eject the unhealthy endpoint. Applicable backend endpoints can be: - VM instances in an Instance Group - Endpoints in a Zonal NEG (GCE_VM_IP, GCE_VM_IP_PORT) - Endpoints in a Hybrid Connectivity NEG (NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT) - Serverless NEGs, that resolve to Cloud Run, App Engine, or Cloud Functions Services - Private Service Connect NEGs, that resolve to Google-managed regional API endpoints or managed services published using Private Service Connect Applicable backend service types can be: - A global backend service with the loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. - A regional backend service with the serviceProtocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED.
