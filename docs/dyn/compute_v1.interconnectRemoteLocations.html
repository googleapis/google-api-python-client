  <pre>Returns the details for the specified interconnect remote location. Gets a list of available interconnect remote locations by making a list() request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  interconnectRemoteLocation: string, Name of the interconnect remote location to return. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;address&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The postal address of the Point of Presence, each line in the address is separated by a newline character.
  &quot;attachmentConfigurationConstraints&quot;: { # [Output Only] Subset of fields from InterconnectAttachment&#x27;s |configurationConstraints| field that apply to all attachments for this remote location.
    &quot;bgpMd5&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Whether the attachment&#x27;s BGP session requires/allows/disallows BGP MD5 authentication. This can take one of the following values: MD5_OPTIONAL, MD5_REQUIRED, MD5_UNSUPPORTED. For example, a Cross-Cloud Interconnect connection to a remote cloud provider that requires BGP MD5 authentication has the interconnectRemoteLocation attachment_configuration_constraints.bgp_md5 field set to MD5_REQUIRED, and that property is propagated to the attachment. Similarly, if BGP MD5 is MD5_UNSUPPORTED, an error is returned if MD5 is requested.
    &quot;bgpPeerAsnRanges&quot;: [ # [Output Only] List of ASN ranges that the remote location is known to support. Formatted as an array of inclusive ranges {min: min-value, max: max-value}. For example, [{min: 123, max: 123}, {min: 64512, max: 65534}] allows the peer ASN to be 123 or anything in the range 64512-65534. This field is only advisory. Although the API accepts other ranges, these are the ranges that we recommend.

Google Cloud API refers only to individual ports, but the UI uses this field when ordering a pair of ports, to prevent users from accidentally ordering something that is incompatible with their cloud provider. Specifically, when ordering a redundant pair of Cross-Cloud Interconnect ports, and one of them uses a remote location with portPairMatchingRemoteLocation set to matching, the UI requires that both ports use the same remote location.

For example, an interconnectRemoteLocation for Azure has {min: 30, max: 30} because Azure requires /30 subnets. This range specifies the values supported by both cloud providers. Interconnect currently supports /29 and /30 IPv4 subnet lengths. If a remote cloud has no constraint on IPv4 subnet length, the range would thus be {min: 29, max: 30}.
      &quot;max&quot;: 42,
      &quot;min&quot;: 42,

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of interconnect remote locations available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  An object of the form:
