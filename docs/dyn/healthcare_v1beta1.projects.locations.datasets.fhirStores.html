<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#import_">import_(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Import resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases where this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to load data. Every resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID. Each resource is stored using the supplied ID regardless of the enable_update_create setting on the FHIR store. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and Cloud Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. The import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of the disable_referential_integrity setting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with arbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but if the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to be imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates referential integrity. The import process does not trigger Pub/Sub notification or BigQuery streaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store. If a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent version of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical version, regardless of the disable_resource_versioning setting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import, it is possible that successfully imported resources will be overwritten more than once. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one resource with that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the contents it will have. The operation result counters do not count duplicate IDs as an error and count one success for each resource in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data organized in bundles produced by Patient-everything where each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner that might be referred to by many patients. If some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported resources are not rolled back. The location and format of the input data are specified by the parameters in ImportResourcesRequest. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the `BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method ignores the `Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected, and does not apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction bundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed as a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten. The bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as provided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As an example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a FHIR search or Patient-everything operation. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). Otherwise, when the operation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse is returned in the response field. The metadata field type for this operation is OperationMetadata.</p>

    <code class="details" id="applyAdminConsents">applyAdminConsents(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Applies the admin Consent resources for the FHIR store and reindexes the underlying resources in the FHIR store according to the aggregate consents. This method also updates the `consent_config.enforced_admin_consents` field of the FhirStore unless `validate_only=true` in ApplyAdminConsentsRequest. Any admin Consent resource change after this operation execution (including deletion) requires you to call ApplyAdminConsents again for the change to take effect. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the progress of the resources that were reindexed, by calling GetOperation. Upon completion, the ApplyAdminConsentsResponse additionally contains the number of resources that were reindexed. If at least one Consent resource contains an error or fails be be enforced for any reason, the method returns an error instead of an Operation. No resources will be reindexed and the `consent_config.enforced_admin_consents` field will be unchanged. To enforce a consent check for data access, `consent_config.access_enforced` must be set to true for the FhirStore.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the FHIR store to enforce, in the format `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to apply the admin Consent resources for the specified FHIR store.
  &quot;newConsentsList&quot;: { # List of admin Consent resources to be applied. # A new list of admin Consent resources to be applied. Any existing enforced Consents, which are specified in `consent_config.enforced_admin_consents` of the FhirStore, that are not part of this list will be disabled. An empty list is equivalent to clearing or disabling all Consents enforced on the FHIR store. When a FHIR store has `disable_resource_versioning=true` and this list contains a Consent resource that exists in `consent_config.enforced_admin_consents`, the method enforces any updates to the existing resource since the last enforcement. If the existing resource hasn&#x27;t been updated since the last enforcement, the resource is unaffected. After the method finishes, the resulting consent enforcement model is determined by the contents of the Consent resource(s) when the method was called: * When `disable_resource_versioning=true`, the result is identical to the current resource(s) in the FHIR store. * When `disable_resource_versioning=false`, the result is based on the historical version(s) of the Consent resource(s) at the point in time when the method was called. At most 200 Consents can be specified.
    &quot;names&quot;: [ # The versioned names of the admin Consent resource(s), in the format `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id}/_history/{version_id}`. For FHIR stores with `disable_resource_versioning=true`, the format is `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id}`.

    ],
  },
  &quot;validateOnly&quot;: True or False, # If true, the method only validates Consent resources to make sure they are supported. Otherwise, the method applies the aggregate consent information to update the enforcement model and reindex the FHIR resources. If all Consent resources can be applied successfully, the ApplyAdminConsentsResponse is returned containing the following fields: * `consent_apply_success` to indicate the number of Consent resources applied. * `affected_resources` to indicate the number of resources that might have had their consent access changed. If, however, one or more Consent resources are unsupported or cannot be applied, the method fails and ApplyAdminConsentsErrorDetail is is returned with details about the unsupported Consent resources.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, fhirStoreId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new FHIR store within the parent dataset.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the dataset this FHIR store belongs to. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a FHIR store.
  &quot;complexDataTypeReferenceParsing&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources.
  &quot;consentConfig&quot;: { # Configures whether to enforce consent for the FHIR store and which consent enforcement version is being used. # Optional. Specifies whether this store has consent enforcement. Not available for DSTU2 FHIR version due to absence of Consent resources.
    &quot;accessDeterminationLogConfig&quot;: { # Configures consent audit log config for FHIR create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. Cloud audit log for healthcare API must be [enabled](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/configure-data-access#config-console-enable). The consent-related logs are included as part of `protoPayload.metadata`. # Optional. Specifies how the server logs the consent-aware requests. If not specified, the `AccessDeterminationLogConfig.LogLevel.MINIMUM` option is used.
      &quot;logLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Controls the amount of detail to include as part of the audit logs.
    },
    &quot;accessEnforced&quot;: True or False, # Optional. The default value is false. If set to true, when accessing FHIR resources, the consent headers will be verified against consents given by patients. See the ConsentEnforcementVersion for the supported consent headers.
    &quot;consentHeaderHandling&quot;: { # How the server handles the consent header. # Optional. Different options to configure the behaviour of the server when handling the `X-Consent-Scope` header.
      &quot;profile&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies the default server behavior when the header is empty. If not specified, the `ScopeProfile.PERMIT_EMPTY_SCOPE` option is used.
    },
    &quot;enforcedAdminConsents&quot;: [ # The versioned names of the enforced admin Consent resource(s), in the format `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id}/_history/{version_id}`. For FHIR stores with `disable_resource_versioning=true`, the format is `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id}`. This field can only be updated using ApplyAdminConsents.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Specifies which consent enforcement version is being used for this FHIR store. This field can only be set once by either CreateFhirStore or UpdateFhirStore. After that, you must call ApplyConsents to change the version.
  },
  &quot;defaultSearchHandlingStrict&quot;: True or False, # If true, overrides the default search behavior for this FHIR store to `handling=strict` which returns an error for unrecognized search parameters. If false, uses the FHIR specification default `handling=lenient` which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header `Prefer: handling=strict` or `Prefer: handling=lenient`. Defaults to false.
  &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist.
  &quot;disableResourceVersioning&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions. Defaults to false.
  &quot;enableHistoryModifications&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether to allow ExecuteBundle to accept history bundles, and directly insert and overwrite historical resource versions into the FHIR store. If set to false, using history bundles fails with an error. Defaults to false.
  &quot;enableUpdateCreate&quot;: True or False, # Whether this FHIR store has the [updateCreate capability](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate). This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-existent resource return errors. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. Defaults to false.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62} Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63} No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Identifier. Resource name of the FHIR store, of the form `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}`.
  &quot;notificationConfig&quot;: { # Specifies where to send notifications upon changes to a data store. # Deprecated. Use `notification_configs` instead.

PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can&#x27;t be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren&#x27;t submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see [Configuring Pub/Sub notifications](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub) for specific details.

      &quot;sendFullResource&quot;: True or False, # Whether to send full FHIR resource to this Pub/Sub topic for Create and Update operation. The default value is false. Note that setting this to true does not guarantee that all resources will be sent in the format of full FHIR resource. When a resource change is too large or during heavy traffic, only the resource name will be sent.

      { # Contains the versioned name and the URL for one SearchParameter.

    ],
  },
  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types, e.g. &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).
        &quot;changeDataCaptureConfig&quot;: { # BigQuery Change Data Capture configuration. # Optional. Setting this field will enable BigQuery&#x27;s Change Data Capture (CDC) on the destination tables. Use this field if you: - Want to only keep the latest version of each resource. Updates and deletes to an existing resource will overwrite the corresponding row. - Have a store with enabled history modifications and want to keep the entire history of resource versions but want the history to be mutable. Updates and deletes to a specific resource version will overwrite the corresponding row. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture for details.
          &quot;historyMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Configures how historical versions of FHIR resources will be reflected in the destination table through updates and deletes. Defaults to `HistoryMode.KEEP_LATEST_VERSION` if unspecified.

Resources deleted from the source store will be deleted from the destination store. Importing resources to the source store will not trigger the streaming. If the source store already contains resources when this option is enabled, those resources will not be copied to the destination store unless they are subsequently updated. This may result in invalid references in the destination store.

  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types, e.g. &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

The Cloud Healthcare Service Agent requires two IAM roles on the BigQuery location: `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` and `roles/bigquery.jobUser`. The output is one BigQuery table per resource type. Unlike when setting `BigQueryDestination` for `StreamConfig`, `ExportResources` does not create BigQuery views.
    &quot;changeDataCaptureConfig&quot;: { # BigQuery Change Data Capture configuration. # Optional. Setting this field will enable BigQuery&#x27;s Change Data Capture (CDC) on the destination tables. Use this field if you: - Want to only keep the latest version of each resource. Updates and deletes to an existing resource will overwrite the corresponding row. - Have a store with enabled history modifications and want to keep the entire history of resource versions but want the history to be mutable. Updates and deletes to a specific resource version will overwrite the corresponding row. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture for details.

If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources.

  &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist.
  &quot;disableResourceVersioning&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store.

  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types, e.g. &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

Updates and deletes to an existing resource will overwrite the corresponding row. - Have a store with enabled history modifications and want to keep the entire history of resource versions but want the history to be mutable. Updates and deletes to a specific resource version will overwrite the corresponding row. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture for details.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="import_">import_(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Import resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases where this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to load data. Every resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID. Each resource is stored using the supplied ID regardless of the enable_update_create setting on the FHIR store. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and Cloud Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. The import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of the disable_referential_integrity setting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with arbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but if the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to be imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates referential integrity. The import process does not trigger Pub/Sub notification or BigQuery streaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store. If a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent version of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical version, regardless of the disable_resource_versioning setting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import, it is possible that successfully imported resources will be overwritten more than once. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one resource with that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the contents it will have. The operation result counters do not count duplicate IDs as an error and count one success for each resource in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data organized in bundles produced by Patient-everything where each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner that might be referred to by many patients. If some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported resources are not rolled back. The location and format of the input data are specified by the parameters in ImportResourcesRequest. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the `BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method ignores the `Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected, and does not apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction bundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed as a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten. The bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as provided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As an example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a FHIR search or Patient-everything operation. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). Otherwise, when the operation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse is returned in the response field. The metadata field type for this operation is OperationMetadata.

  <pre>Lists the FHIR stores in the given dataset.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the dataset. (required)
  filter: string, Restricts stores returned to those matching a filter. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `&quot;query text&quot;`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `&quot;Comment = great&quot;` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it&#x27;s just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Only filtering on labels is supported, for example `labels.key=value`.
  pageSize: integer, Limit on the number of FHIR stores to return in a single response. If not specified, 100 is used. May not be larger than 1000.

If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources.

      &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist.

Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
        { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
          &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types, e.g. &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

For example, the resource field `Patient.Address.city`, which uses a [string](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes-definitions.html#Address.city) type, can be matched by `Patient.Address.String`. Partial matching is supported. For example, `Patient.Address.city` can be matched by `Address.city` (with `Patient` omitted). Partial matching and type matching can be combined, for example `Patient.Address.city` can be matched by `Address.String`. For &quot;choice&quot; types (those defined in the FHIR spec with the format `field[x]`), use two separate components. For example, `deceasedAge.unit` is matched by `Deceased.Age.unit`.

  &quot;complexDataTypeReferenceParsing&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources.
  &quot;consentConfig&quot;: { # Configures whether to enforce consent for the FHIR store and which consent enforcement version is being used. # Optional. Specifies whether this store has consent enforcement. Not available for DSTU2 FHIR version due to absence of Consent resources.
    &quot;accessDeterminationLogConfig&quot;: { # Configures consent audit log config for FHIR create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. Cloud audit log for healthcare API must be [enabled](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/configure-data-access#config-console-enable). The consent-related logs are included as part of `protoPayload.metadata`. # Optional. Specifies how the server logs the consent-aware requests. If not specified, the `AccessDeterminationLogConfig.LogLevel.MINIMUM` option is used.
      &quot;logLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Controls the amount of detail to include as part of the audit logs.
    },
    &quot;accessEnforced&quot;: True or False, # Optional. The default value is false. If set to true, when accessing FHIR resources, the consent headers will be verified against consents given by patients. See the ConsentEnforcementVersion for the supported consent headers.
    &quot;consentHeaderHandling&quot;: { # How the server handles the consent header. # Optional. Different options to configure the behaviour of the server when handling the `X-Consent-Scope` header.
      &quot;profile&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies the default server behavior when the header is empty. If not specified, the `ScopeProfile.PERMIT_EMPTY_SCOPE` option is used.
    },

For FHIR stores with `disable_resource_versioning=true`, the format is `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}/fhir/Consent/{resource_id}`. This field can only be updated using ApplyAdminConsents.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Specifies which consent enforcement version is being used for this FHIR store. This field can only be set once by either CreateFhirStore or UpdateFhirStore. After that, you must call ApplyConsents to change the version.
  },
  &quot;defaultSearchHandlingStrict&quot;: True or False, # If true, overrides the default search behavior for this FHIR store to `handling=strict` which returns an error for unrecognized search parameters. If false, uses the FHIR specification default `handling=lenient` which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header `Prefer: handling=strict` or `Prefer: handling=lenient`. Defaults to false.
  &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist.
  &quot;disableResourceVersioning&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions. Defaults to false.
  &quot;enableHistoryModifications&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether to allow ExecuteBundle to accept history bundles, and directly insert and overwrite historical resource versions into the FHIR store. If set to false, using history bundles fails with an error. Defaults to false.
  &quot;enableUpdateCreate&quot;: True or False, # Whether this FHIR store has the [updateCreate capability](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate). This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-existent resource return errors. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. Defaults to false.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62} Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63} No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.

    ],
  },
  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types, e.g. &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).
        &quot;changeDataCaptureConfig&quot;: { # BigQuery Change Data Capture configuration. # Optional. Setting this field will enable BigQuery&#x27;s Change Data Capture (CDC) on the destination tables. Use this field if you: - Want to only keep the latest version of each resource. Updates and deletes to an existing resource will overwrite the corresponding row. - Have a store with enabled history modifications and want to keep the entire history of resource versions but want the history to be mutable. Updates and deletes to a specific resource version will overwrite the corresponding row. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture for details.
          &quot;historyMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Configures how historical versions of FHIR resources will be reflected in the destination table through updates and deletes. Defaults to `HistoryMode.KEEP_LATEST_VERSION` if unspecified.

Resources deleted from the source store will be deleted from the destination store. Importing resources to the source store will not trigger the streaming. If the source store already contains resources when this option is enabled, those resources will not be copied to the destination store unless they are subsequently updated. This may result in invalid references in the destination store.

  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types, e.g. &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;auditConfigs&quot;: [ # Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    { # Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs: { &quot;audit_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;allServices&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:jose@example.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;ADMIN_READ&quot; } ] }, { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;sampleservice.googleapis.com&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:aliya@example.com&quot; ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.
      &quot;auditLogConfigs&quot;: [ # The configuration for logging of each type of permission.

  &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as `*` or `storage.*`) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).

  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
