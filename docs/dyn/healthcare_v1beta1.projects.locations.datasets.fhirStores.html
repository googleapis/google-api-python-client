<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="import_">import_(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Import resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified
sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using
import semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are
not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into
an empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases
where this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to
load data.

Every resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID, and will be
stored using that ID regardless of the
enable_update_create setting on the FHIR
store.

The import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of
the
disable_referential_integrity
setting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with
arbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but
if the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to
be imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates
referential integrity.

The import process does not trigger Cloud Pub/Sub notification or BigQuery
streaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store.

If a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent
version of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical
version, regardless of the
disable_resource_versioning
setting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import,
it is possible that successfully imported resources will be overwritten
more than once.

The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple
valid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case,
after the import completes, the store will contain exactly one resource
with that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the
contents it will have. The operation result counters do not count
duplicate IDs as an error and will count one success for each resource in
the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number
of resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data
organized in bundles produced by Patient-everything
where each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner
that might be referred to by many patients.

If some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors,
successfully imported resources are not rolled back.

The location and format of the input data is specified by the parameters
below. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the
`BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method ignores the
`Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected, and does
not apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction
bundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed
as a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten.
The bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as
provided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As
an example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a
FHIR search or
Patient-everything operation.

This method returns an Operation that can
be used to track the status of the import by calling
GetOperation.

Immediate fatal errors appear in the
error field, errors are also logged
to Stackdriver (see [Viewing
logs](/healthcare/docs/how-tos/stackdriver-logging)). Otherwise, when the
operation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse
is returned in the response field.
The metadata field type for this
operation is OperationMetadata.

  <pre>Searches for resources in the given FHIR store according to criteria
specified as query parameters.

Implements the FHIR standard search interaction
([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#search),
[STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#search),
[R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#search))
using the search semantics described in the FHIR Search specification
([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/search.html),
[STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html),
[R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/search.html)).

Supports three methods of search defined by the specification:

*  `GET [base]?[parameters]` to search across all resources.
*  `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search resources of a specified
type.
*  `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having
the same semantics as the `GET` method.

The `GET` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST` method
does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search parameters.

On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation
of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the
search.
Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

The server's capability statement, retrieved through
capabilities, indicates what search parameters
are supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters
defined by the specification can be found in the FHIR Search Parameter
Registry
([STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-registry.html),
[R4](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/searchparameter-registry.html)).
FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be found on each resource's definition
page.

Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`,
`:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`.

Supported search result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`,
`_revinclude`, `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`.

The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can
be overridden by the `_count` parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. If
there are additional results, the returned `Bundle` will contain
pagination links.

Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than
50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated
search index in those cases.

Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight
delay between the time a resource is created or changes and when the change
is reflected in search results.

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the FHIR store to retrieve resources from. (required)
  resourceType: string, The FHIR resource type to search, such as Patient or Observation. For a
complete list, see the FHIR Resource Index
([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/resourcelist.html),
[STU3](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/resourcelist.html),

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
        # payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
        # an HTML page.
        #
        #
        # This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
        # the request as well as the response.
        #
        # It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
        # wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        # request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.
        #
        # Example:
        #
        #     message GetResourceRequest {
        #       // A unique request id.
        #       string request_id = 1;

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

        # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
        # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
        # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
        # request, the resource, or both.

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.

      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the

    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
