  <pre>Import resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified
sources. Each resource must have a client-supplied ID, which is retained
by the server.

The import operation is idempotent. Upon retry, the most recent data
(matching the client-supplied ID) is overwritten, without creating a new
resource version. If partial failures occur during the import, successful
changes are not rolled back.

If history imports are enabled
(enable_history_import is set in the
FHIR store's configuration), you can import historical versions of a
resource by supplying a bundle of type `history`. The historical versions
in the bundle must have `lastUpdated` timestamps. If a current or
historical version with the supplied resource ID already exists, the
bundle is rejected.

This method returns an Operation that can
be used to track the status of the import by calling
GetOperation.

Immediate fatal errors appear in the
error field.
Otherwise, when the operation finishes, a detailed response of type
ImportResourcesResponse is returned in the
response field.
The metadata field type for this
operation is OperationMetadata.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more

    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
