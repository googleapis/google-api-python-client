<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, uniqueWriterIdentity=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a sink that exports specified log entries to a destination. The export of newly-ingested log entries begins immediately, unless the sink's writer_identity is not permitted to write to the destination. A sink can export log entries only from the resource owning the sink.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource in which to create the sink:
"projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
"organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]"
"billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]"
"folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
Examples: "projects/my-logging-project", "organizations/123456789". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a sink used to export log entries to one of the following destinations in any project: a Cloud Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. A logs filter controls which log entries are exported. The sink must be created within a project, organization, billing account, or folder.
  "updateTime": "A String", # Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks.
  "name": "A String", # Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example: "my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub". Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
  "destination": "A String", # Required. The export destination:
      # "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"
      # "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]"
      # "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"
      # The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks.
  "createTime": "A String", # Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks.
  "filter": "A String", # Optional. An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter. For example:
      # logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND severity>=ERROR
  "outputVersionFormat": "A String", # Deprecated. The log entry format to use for this sink's exported log entries. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.
  "writerIdentity": "A String", # Output only. An IAM identity&mdash;a service account or group&mdash;under which Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource. Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.
  "includeChildren": True or False, # Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then logs from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent. To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:
      # logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND
      # resource.type=gce_instance
}

  uniqueWriterIdentity: boolean, Optional. Determines the kind of IAM identity returned as writer_identity in the new sink. If this value is omitted or set to false, and if the sink's parent is a project, then the value returned as writer_identity is the same group or service account used by Logging before the addition of writer identities to this API. The sink's destination must be in the same project as the sink itself.If this field is set to true, or if the sink is owned by a non-project resource such as an organization, then the value of writer_identity will be a unique service account used only for exports from the new sink. For more information, see writer_identity in LogSink.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  uniqueWriterIdentity: boolean, Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field:
If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity.
If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a unique service account.
It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false.
  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:  destination,filter,includeChildren At some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskExample: updateMask=filter.

    "includeChildren": True or False, # Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then logs from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent. To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:
        # logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND
        # resource.type=gce_instance
  }</pre>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(sinkName, body, uniqueWriterIdentity=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates a sink. This method replaces the following fields in the existing sink with values from the new sink: destination, and filter.The updated sink might also have a new writer_identity; see the unique_writer_identity field.

Args:
  sinkName: string, Required. The full resource name of the sink to update, including the parent resource and the sink identifier:
"projects/[PROJECT_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]"
"organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]"
"billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]"
"folders/[FOLDER_ID]/sinks/[SINK_ID]"
Example: "projects/my-project-id/sinks/my-sink-id". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a sink used to export log entries to one of the following destinations in any project: a Cloud Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. A logs filter controls which log entries are exported. The sink must be created within a project, organization, billing account, or folder.
  "updateTime": "A String", # Output only. The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks.
  "name": "A String", # Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example: "my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub". Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
  "destination": "A String", # Required. The export destination:
      # "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"
      # "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]"
      # "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"
      # The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks.
  "createTime": "A String", # Output only. The creation timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks.
  "filter": "A String", # Optional. An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter. For example:
      # logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND severity>=ERROR
  "outputVersionFormat": "A String", # Deprecated. The log entry format to use for this sink's exported log entries. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.
  "writerIdentity": "A String", # Output only. An IAM identity&mdash;a service account or group&mdash;under which Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource. Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.
  "includeChildren": True or False, # Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then logs from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent. To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:
      # logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND
      # resource.type=gce_instance
}

  uniqueWriterIdentity: boolean, Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field:
If the old and new values of this field are both false or both true, then there is no change to the sink's writer_identity.
If the old value is false and the new value is true, then writer_identity is changed to a unique service account.
It is an error if the old value is true and the new value is set to false or defaulted to false.
  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask that specifies the fields in sink that need an update. A sink field will be overwritten if, and only if, it is in the update mask. name and output only fields cannot be updated.An empty updateMask is temporarily treated as using the following mask for backwards compatibility purposes:  destination,filter,includeChildren At some point in the future, behavior will be removed and specifying an empty updateMask will be an error.For a detailed FieldMask definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.FieldMaskExample: updateMask=filter.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
