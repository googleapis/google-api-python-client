<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates the given topic with the given name.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the topic. It must have the format
`"projects/{project}/topics/{topic}"`. `{topic}` must start with a letter,
and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`),
underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`), plus (`+`) or percent
signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it
must not start with `"goog"`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A topic resource.
  "name": "A String", # The name of the topic. It must have the format
      # `"projects/{project}/topics/{topic}"`. `{topic}` must start with a letter,
      # and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`),
      # underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`), plus (`+`) or percent
      # signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it
      # must not start with `"goog"`.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(topic, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the topic with the given name. Returns `NOT_FOUND` if the topic
does not exist. After a topic is deleted, a new topic may be created with
the same name; this is an entirely new topic with none of the old
configuration or subscriptions. Existing subscriptions to this topic are
not deleted, but their `topic` field is set to `_deleted-topic_`.

      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
  }</pre>
