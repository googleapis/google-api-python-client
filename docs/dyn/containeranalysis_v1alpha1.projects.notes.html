    The object takes the form of:

{ # Provides a detailed description of a `Note`.
  &quot;attestationAuthority&quot;: { # Note kind that represents a logical attestation &quot;role&quot; or &quot;authority&quot;. For example, an organization might have one `AttestationAuthority` for &quot;QA&quot; and one for &quot;build&quot;. This Note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached Attestation Occurrences, even if they don&#x27;t all live in the same project. # A note describing an attestation role.
    &quot;hint&quot;: { # This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of the AttestationAuthority. Because the name of a Note acts as its resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes) from &quot;readable&quot; names more suitable for debug output. Note that these hints should NOT be used to look up AttestationAuthorities in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up Attestations to verify.
      &quot;humanReadableName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The human readable name of this Attestation Authority, for example &quot;qa&quot;.
    },
  },

If `key_type` is empty, this defaults to PEM encoded public keys. This field may be empty if `key_id` references an external key. For Cloud Build based signatures, this is a PEM encoded public key. To verify the Cloud Build signature, place the contents of this field into a file (public.pem). The signature field is base64-decoded into its binary representation in signature.bin, and the provenance bytes from `BuildDetails` are base64-decoded into a binary representation in signed.bin. OpenSSL can then verify the signature: `openssl sha256 -verify public.pem -signature signature.bin signed.bin`

    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a note or an `Occurrence` resource. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a note or occurrence, respectively. Attempting to call this method on a resource without the required permission will result in a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error. Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}` for occurrences and projects/{PROJECT_ID}/notes/{NOTE_ID} for notes

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified `Note` or `Occurrence`. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a `Note` or an `Occurrence`, respectively. Attempting to call this method without these permissions will result in a ` `PERMISSION_DENIED` error. Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has `containeranalysis.notes.list` permission on a `Note` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.list` on an `Occurrence`, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{projectid}/occurrences/{occurrenceid}` for occurrences and projects/{projectid}/notes/{noteid} for notes

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`.

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.

      &quot;condition&quot;: { # Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec.

See the service documentation for additional information. # The condition that is associated with this binding. If the condition evaluates to `true`, then this binding applies to the current request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding might grant the same role to one or more of the members in this binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

      &quot;members&quot;: [ # Specifies the identities requesting access for a Cloud Platform resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`.

For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the permissions that a caller has on the specified note or occurrence resource. Requires list permission on the project (for example, &quot;storage.objects.list&quot; on the containing bucket for testing permission of an object). Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}` for `Occurrences` and `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/notes/{NOTE_ID}` for `Notes`

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
