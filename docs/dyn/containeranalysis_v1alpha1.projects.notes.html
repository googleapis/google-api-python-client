<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a note or an `Occurrence` resource.
Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or
`containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is
a note or occurrence, respectively.
Attempting to call this method on a resource without the required
permission will result in a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error. Attempting to call
this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error
if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED`
error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}` for occurrences and
projects/{PROJECT_ID}/notes/{NOTE_ID} for notes

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified `Note` or `Occurrence`.
Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or
`containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is
a `Note` or an `Occurrence`, respectively.
Attempting to call this method without these permissions will result in a `
`PERMISSION_DENIED` error.
Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a
`NOT_FOUND` error if the user has `containeranalysis.notes.list` permission
on a `Note` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.list` on an `Occurrence`, or
a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following
formats: `projects/{projectid}/occurrences/{occurrenceid}` for occurrences
and projects/{projectid}/notes/{noteid} for notes

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the permissions that a caller has on the specified note or
occurrence resource. Requires list permission on the project (for example,
"storage.objects.list" on the containing bucket for testing permission of
an object). Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will
result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the
project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the
following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}` for
`Occurrences` and `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/notes/{NOTE_ID}` for `Notes`

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more

        # allowed.
