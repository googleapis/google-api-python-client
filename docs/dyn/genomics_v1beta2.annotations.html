<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchCreate">batchCreate(body)</code>
  <pre>Creates one or more new annotations atomically. All annotations must belong to the same annotation set. Caller must have WRITE permission for this annotation set. For optimal performance, batch positionally adjacent annotations together.


If the request has a systemic issue, such as an attempt to write to an inaccessible annotation set, the entire RPC will fail accordingly. For lesser data issues, when possible an error will be isolated to the corresponding batch entry in the response; the remaining well formed annotations will be created normally.

  <pre>Searches for annotations that match the given criteria. Results are ordered by genomic coordinate (by reference sequence, then position). Annotations with equivalent genomic coordinates are returned in an unspecified order. This order is consistent, such that two queries for the same content (regardless of page size) yield annotations in the same order across their respective streams of paginated responses. Caller must have READ permission for the queried annotation sets.

Args:

    The object takes the form of:

      "end": "A String", # The end position of the range on the reference, 0-based exclusive. If specified, referenceId or referenceName must also be specified. If unset or 0, defaults to the length of the reference.
