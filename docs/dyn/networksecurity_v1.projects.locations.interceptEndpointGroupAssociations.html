  <pre>Creates an association in a given project and location. See https://google.aip.dev/133.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource where this association will be created. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An endpoint group association represents a link between a network and an endpoint group in the organization. Creating an association creates the networking infrastructure linking the network to the endpoint group, but does not enable intercept by itself. To enable intercept, the user must also create a network firewall policy containing intercept rules and associate it with the network.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created. See https://google.aip.dev/148#timestamps.
  &quot;interceptEndpointGroup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The endpoint group that this association is connected to, for example: `projects/123456789/locations/global/interceptEndpointGroups/my-eg`. See https://google.aip.dev/124.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels are key/value pairs that help to organize and filter resources.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;locations&quot;: [ # Output only. The list of locations where the association is configured. This information is retrieved from the linked endpoint group.
    { # Details about intercept in a specific cloud location.
      &quot;location&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The cloud location, e.g. &quot;us-central1-a&quot; or &quot;asia-south1&quot;.

    },
  ],

      &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the association in this location.
    },
  ],
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Identifier. The resource name of this endpoint group association, for example: `projects/123456789/locations/global/interceptEndpointGroupAssociations/my-eg-association`. See https://google.aip.dev/122 for more details.

It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
