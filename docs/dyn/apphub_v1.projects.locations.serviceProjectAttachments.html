<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, requestId=None, serviceProjectAttachmentId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Attaches a service project to the host project.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Host project ID and location to which service project is being attached. Only global location is supported. Expected format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # ServiceProjectAttachment represents an attachment from a service project to a host project. Service projects contain the underlying cloud infrastructure resources, and expose these resources to the host project through a ServiceProjectAttachment. With the attachments, the host project can provide an aggregated view of resources across all service projects.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Create time.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The resource name of a ServiceProjectAttachment. Format: &quot;projects/{host-project-id}/locations/global/serviceProjectAttachments/{service-project-id}.&quot;
  &quot;serviceProject&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. Service project name in the format: &quot;projects/abc&quot; or &quot;projects/123&quot;. As input, project name with either project id or number are accepted. As output, this field will contain project number.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. ServiceProjectAttachment state.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A globally unique identifier (in UUID4 format) for the `ServiceProjectAttachment`.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  serviceProjectAttachmentId: string, Required. The service project attachment identifier must contain the project id of the service project specified in the service_project_attachment.service_project field.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  },

Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
