<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="approve">approve(enterpriseId, productId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre> Approves the specified product and the relevant app permissions, if any. The maximum number of products that you can approve per enterprise customer is 1,000. To learn how to use managed Google Play to design and create a store layout to display approved products to your users, see Store Layout Design. **Note:** This item has been deprecated. New integrations cannot use this method and can refer to our new recommendations. 

Args:
  enterpriseId: string, The ID of the enterprise. (required)
  productId: string, The ID of the product. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;approvalUrlInfo&quot;: { # Information on an approval URL. # The approval URL that was shown to the user. Only the permissions shown to the user with that URL will be accepted, which may not be the product&#x27;s entire set of permissions. For example, the URL may only display new permissions from an update after the product was approved, or not include new permissions if the product was updated since the URL was generated.
    &quot;approvalUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A URL that displays a product&#x27;s permissions and that can also be used to approve the product with the Products.approve call.
  },
  &quot;approvedPermissions&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Sets how new permission requests for the product are handled. &quot;allPermissions&quot; automatically approves all current and future permissions for the product. &quot;currentPermissionsOnly&quot; approves the current set of permissions for the product, but any future permissions added through updates will require manual reapproval. If not specified, only the current set of permissions will be approved.
