<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="approve">approve(enterpriseId, productId, body)</code>
  <pre>Approves the specified product (and the relevant app permissions, if any).

Args:
  enterpriseId: string, The ID of the enterprise. (required)
  productId: string, The ID of the product. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "approvalUrlInfo": { # Information on an approval URL. # The approval URL that was shown to the user. Only the permissions shown to the user with that URL will be accepted, which may not be the product's entire set of permissions. For example, the URL may only display new permissions from an update after the product was approved, or not include new permissions if the product was updated since the URL was generated.
      "kind": "androidenterprise#approvalUrlInfo", # Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "androidenterprise#approvalUrlInfo".
      "approvalUrl": "A String", # A URL that displays a product's permissions and that can also be used to approve the product with the Products.approve call.
    },
  }

</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="generateApprovalUrl">generateApprovalUrl(enterpriseId, productId, languageCode=None)</code>
  <pre>Generates a URL that can be rendered in an iframe to display the permissions (if any) of a product. An enterprise admin must view these permissions and accept them on behalf of their organization in order to approve that product.

Admins should accept the displayed permissions by interacting with a separate UI element in the EMM console, which in turn should trigger the use of this URL as the approvalUrlInfo.approvalUrl property in a Products.approve call to approve the product. This URL can only be used to display permissions for up to 1 day.

Args:
  enterpriseId: string, The ID of the enterprise. (required)
  productId: string, The ID of the product. (required)
  languageCode: string, The BCP 47 language code used for permission names and descriptions in the returned iframe, for instance "en-US".

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "url": "A String", # A URL that can be rendered in an iframe to display the permissions (if any) of a product. This URL can be used to approve the product only once and only within 24 hours of being generated, using the Products.approve call. If the product is currently unapproved and has no permissions, this URL will point to an empty page. If the product is currently approved, a URL will only be generated if that product has added permissions since it was last approved, and the URL will only display those new permissions that have not yet been accepted.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(enterpriseId, productId, language=None)</code>
