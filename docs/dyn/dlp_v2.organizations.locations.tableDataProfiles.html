<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists table data profiles for an organization.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Resource name of the organization or project, for example `organizations/433245324/locations/europe` or `projects/project-id/locations/asia`. (required)
  filter: string, Allows filtering. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * Supported fields/values: - `project_id` - The Google Cloud project ID. - `dataset_id` - The BigQuery dataset ID. - `table_id` - The ID of the BigQuery table. - `sensitivity_level` - HIGH|MODERATE|LOW - `data_risk_level` - HIGH|MODERATE|LOW - `resource_visibility`: PUBLIC|RESTRICTED - `status_code` - an RPC status code as defined in https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/code.proto * The operator must be `=` or `!=`. Examples: * `project_id = 12345 AND status_code = 1` * `project_id = 12345 AND sensitivity_level = HIGH` * `project_id = 12345 AND resource_visibility = PUBLIC` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
  orderBy: string, Comma-separated list of fields to order by, followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case insensitive. The default sorting order is ascending. Redundant space characters are insignificant. Only one order field at a time is allowed. Examples: * `project_id asc` * `table_id` * `sensitivity_level desc` Supported fields are: - `project_id`: The Google Cloud project ID. - `dataset_id`: The ID of a BigQuery dataset. - `table_id`: The ID of a BigQuery table. - `sensitivity_level`: How sensitive the data in a table is, at most. - `data_risk_level`: How much risk is associated with this data. - `profile_last_generated`: When the profile was last updated in epoch seconds. - `last_modified`: The last time the resource was modified. - `resource_visibility`: Visibility restriction for this resource. - `row_count`: Number of rows in this resource.
  pageSize: integer, Size of the page. This value can be limited by the server. If zero, server returns a page of max size 100.
  pageToken: string, Page token to continue retrieval.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
