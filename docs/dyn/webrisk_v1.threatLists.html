  <pre>Gets the most recent threat list diffs. These diffs should be applied to a local database of hashes to keep it up-to-date. If the local database is empty or excessively out-of-date, a complete snapshot of the database will be returned. This Method only updates a single ThreatList at a time. To update multiple ThreatList databases, this method needs to be called once for each list.

Args:
  constraints_maxDatabaseEntries: integer, Sets the maximum number of entries that the client is willing to have in the local database. This should be a power of 2 between 2**10 and 2**20. If zero, no database size limit is set.
  constraints_maxDiffEntries: integer, The maximum size in number of entries. The diff will not contain more entries than this value. This should be a power of 2 between 2**10 and 2**20. If zero, no diff size limit is set.
  constraints_supportedCompressions: string, The compression types supported by the client. (repeated)
    Allowed values
      COMPRESSION_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED - Unknown.
      RAW - Raw, uncompressed data.
      RICE - Rice-Golomb encoded data.
  threatType: string, Required. The threat list to update. Only a single ThreatType should be specified per request. If you want to handle multiple ThreatTypes, you must make one request per ThreatType.
    Allowed values
      THREAT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED - No entries should match this threat type. This threat type is unused.
      MALWARE - Malware targeting any platform.
      SOCIAL_ENGINEERING - Social engineering targeting any platform.
      UNWANTED_SOFTWARE - Unwanted software targeting any platform.
      SOCIAL_ENGINEERING_EXTENDED_COVERAGE - A list of extended coverage social engineering URIs targeting any platform.
  versionToken: string, The current version token of the client for the requested list (the client version that was received from the last successful diff). If the client does not have a version token (this is the first time calling ComputeThreatListDiff), this may be left empty and a full database snapshot will be returned.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
  &quot;additions&quot;: { # Contains the set of entries to add to a local database. May contain a combination of compressed and raw data in a single response. # A set of entries to add to a local threat type&#x27;s list.
    &quot;rawHashes&quot;: [ # The raw SHA256-formatted entries. Repeated to allow returning sets of hashes with different prefix sizes.
      { # The uncompressed threat entries in hash format. Hashes can be anywhere from 4 to 32 bytes in size. A large majority are 4 bytes, but some hashes are lengthened if they collide with the hash of a popular URI. Used for sending ThreatEntryAdditons to clients that do not support compression, or when sending non-4-byte hashes to clients that do support compression.
        &quot;prefixSize&quot;: 42, # The number of bytes for each prefix encoded below. This field can be anywhere from 4 (shortest prefix) to 32 (full SHA256 hash). In practice this is almost always 4, except in exceptional circumstances.
        &quot;rawHashes&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The hashes, in binary format, concatenated into one long string. Hashes are sorted in lexicographic order. For JSON API users, hashes are base64-encoded.
      },
    ],
    &quot;riceHashes&quot;: { # The Rice-Golomb encoded data. Used for sending compressed 4-byte hashes or compressed removal indices. # The encoded 4-byte prefixes of SHA256-formatted entries, using a Golomb-Rice encoding. The hashes are converted to uint32, sorted in ascending order, then delta encoded and stored as encoded_data.
      &quot;encodedData&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The encoded deltas that are encoded using the Golomb-Rice coder.
      &quot;entryCount&quot;: 42, # The number of entries that are delta encoded in the encoded data. If only a single integer was encoded, this will be zero and the single value will be stored in `first_value`.
      &quot;firstValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The offset of the first entry in the encoded data, or, if only a single integer was encoded, that single integer&#x27;s value. If the field is empty or missing, assume zero.
      &quot;riceParameter&quot;: 42, # The Golomb-Rice parameter, which is a number between 2 and 28. This field is missing (that is, zero) if `num_entries` is zero.
    },
  },
  &quot;checksum&quot;: { # The expected state of a client&#x27;s local database. # The expected SHA256 hash of the client state; that is, of the sorted list of all hashes present in the database after applying the provided diff. If the client state doesn&#x27;t match the expected state, the client must discard this diff and retry later.
    &quot;sha256&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The SHA256 hash of the client state; that is, of the sorted list of all hashes present in the database.
  },
  &quot;newVersionToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The new opaque client version token. This should be retained by the client and passed into the next call of ComputeThreatListDiff as &#x27;version_token&#x27;. A separate version token should be stored and used for each threatList.
  &quot;recommendedNextDiff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The soonest the client should wait before issuing any diff request. Querying sooner is unlikely to produce a meaningful diff. Waiting longer is acceptable considering the use case. If this field is not set clients may update as soon as they want.
  &quot;removals&quot;: { # Contains the set of entries to remove from a local database. # A set of entries to remove from a local threat type&#x27;s list. This field may be empty.
    &quot;rawIndices&quot;: { # A set of raw indices to remove from a local list. # The raw removal indices for a local list.
      &quot;indices&quot;: [ # The indices to remove from a lexicographically-sorted local list.
        42,
      ],
    },
    &quot;riceIndices&quot;: { # The Rice-Golomb encoded data. Used for sending compressed 4-byte hashes or compressed removal indices. # The encoded local, lexicographically-sorted list indices, using a Golomb-Rice encoding. Used for sending compressed removal indices. The removal indices (uint32) are sorted in ascending order, then delta encoded and stored as encoded_data.
      &quot;encodedData&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The encoded deltas that are encoded using the Golomb-Rice coder.

    },
  },
  &quot;responseType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of response. This may indicate that an action must be taken by the client when the response is received.
