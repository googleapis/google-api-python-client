  <pre>Filters an organization&#x27;s assets and groups them by their specified properties.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the parent to group the assets by. Its format is &quot;organizations/[organization_id]&quot;, &quot;folders/[folder_id]&quot;, or &quot;projects/[project_id]&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for grouping by assets.
  &quot;compareDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When compare_duration is set, the GroupResult&#x27;s &quot;state_change&quot; property is updated to indicate whether the asset was added, removed, or remained present during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state change value is derived based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don&#x27;t affect the result. For example, the results aren&#x27;t affected if the asset is removed and re-created again. Possible &quot;state_change&quot; values when compare_duration is specified: * &quot;ADDED&quot;: indicates that the asset was not present at the start of compare_duration, but present at reference_time. * &quot;REMOVED&quot;: indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration, but not present at reference_time. * &quot;ACTIVE&quot;: indicates that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time period defined by compare_duration and reference_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is &quot;UNUSED&quot;, which will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time. If this field is set then `state_change` must be a specified field in `group_by`.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets. The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name * security_center_properties.resource_name * resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: * name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time = &quot;2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00&quot;` `update_time = 1560208038000` * create_time: `=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `create_time = &quot;2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00&quot;` `create_time = 1560208038000` * iam_policy.policy_blob: `=`, `:` * resource_properties: `=`, `:`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_type: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name: `=`, `:` * security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example, `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing: `resource_properties.my_property : &quot;&quot;` Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property not existing: `-resource_properties.my_property : &quot;&quot;`
  &quot;groupBy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Expression that defines what assets fields to use for grouping. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: &quot;security_center_properties.resource_project,security_center_properties.project&quot;. The following fields are supported when compare_duration is not set: * security_center_properties.resource_project * security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name * security_center_properties.resource_type * security_center_properties.resource_parent * security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name The following fields are supported when compare_duration is set: * security_center_properties.resource_type * security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name * security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name
  &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
  &quot;pageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The value returned by the last `GroupAssetsResponse`; indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `GroupAssets` call, and that the system should return the next page of data.
  &quot;readTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time used as a reference point when filtering assets. The filter is limited to assets existing at the supplied time and their values are those at that specific time. Absence of this field will default to the API&#x27;s version of NOW.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for grouping by assets.
  &quot;groupByResults&quot;: [ # Group results. There exists an element for each existing unique combination of property/values. The element contains a count for the number of times those specific property/values appear.
    { # Result containing the properties and count of a groupBy request.
      &quot;count&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Total count of resources for the given properties.
      &quot;properties&quot;: { # Properties matching the groupBy fields in the request.
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
      },
    },
  ],
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Token to retrieve the next page of results, or empty if there are no more results.
  &quot;readTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time used for executing the groupBy request.
  &quot;totalSize&quot;: 42, # The total number of results matching the query.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, compareDuration=None, fieldMask=None, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, readTime=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists an organization&#x27;s assets.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the parent resource that contains the assets. The value that you can specify on parent depends on the method in which you specify parent. You can specify one of the following values: &quot;organizations/[organization_id]&quot;, &quot;folders/[folder_id]&quot;, or &quot;projects/[project_id]&quot;. (required)
  compareDuration: string, When compare_duration is set, the ListAssetsResult&#x27;s &quot;state_change&quot; attribute is updated to indicate whether the asset was added, removed, or remained present during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don&#x27;t affect the result. For example, the results aren&#x27;t affected if the asset is removed and re-created again. Possible &quot;state_change&quot; values when compare_duration is specified: * &quot;ADDED&quot;: indicates that the asset was not present at the start of compare_duration, but present at read_time. * &quot;REMOVED&quot;: indicates that the asset was present at the start of compare_duration, but not present at read_time. * &quot;ACTIVE&quot;: indicates that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time period defined by compare_duration and read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is &quot;UNUSED&quot;, which will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time.
  fieldMask: string, A field mask to specify the ListAssetsResult fields to be listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
  filter: string, Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets. The expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name * security_center_properties.resource_name * resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.

Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing: `resource_properties.my_property : &quot;&quot;` Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property not existing: `-resource_properties.my_property : &quot;&quot;`
  orderBy: string, Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: &quot;name,resource_properties.a_property&quot;. The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix &quot; desc&quot; should be appended to the field name. For example: &quot;name desc,resource_properties.a_property&quot;. Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant. &quot;name desc,resource_properties.a_property&quot; and &quot; name desc , resource_properties.a_property &quot; are equivalent. The following fields are supported: name update_time resource_properties security_marks.marks security_center_properties.resource_name security_center_properties.resource_display_name security_center_properties.resource_parent security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name security_center_properties.resource_project security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name security_center_properties.resource_type
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
  pageToken: string, The value returned by the last `ListAssetsResponse`; indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListAssets` call, and that the system should return the next page of data.
