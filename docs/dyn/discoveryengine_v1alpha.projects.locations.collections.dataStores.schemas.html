If completable_option is unset, the server behavior defaults to COMPLETABLE_DISABLED for fields that support setting completable options, which are just `string` fields. For those fields that do not support setting completable options, the server will skip completable option setting, and setting completable_option for those fields will throw `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
      &quot;dynamicFacetableOption&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If dynamic_facetable_option is DYNAMIC_FACETABLE_ENABLED, field values are available for dynamic facet. Could only be DYNAMIC_FACETABLE_DISABLED if FieldConfig.indexable_option is INDEXABLE_DISABLED. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error will be returned.

If indexable_option is unset, the server behavior defaults to INDEXABLE_DISABLED for fields that support setting indexable options. For those fields that do not support setting indexable options, such as `object` and `boolean` and key properties, the server will skip indexable_option setting, and setting indexable_option for those fields will throw `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.

Example types are `title`, `description`. Full list is defined by `keyPropertyMapping` in the schema field annotation. If the schema field has a `KeyPropertyMapping` annotation, `indexable_option` and `searchable_option` of this field cannot be modified.
      &quot;metatagName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The metatag name found in the HTML page. If user defines this field, the value of this metatag name will be used to extract metatag. If the user does not define this field, the FieldConfig.field_path will be used to extract metatag.

If recs_filterable_option is unset, the default setting is FILTERABLE_DISABLED for fields that support setting filterable options.
