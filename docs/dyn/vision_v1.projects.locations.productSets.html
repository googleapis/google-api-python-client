<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="import_">import_(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Asynchronous API that imports a list of reference images to specified product sets based on a list of image information. The google.longrunning.Operation API can be used to keep track of the progress and results of the request. `Operation.metadata` contains `BatchOperationMetadata`. (progress) `Operation.response` contains `ImportProductSetsResponse`. (results) The input source of this method is a csv file on Google Cloud Storage. For the format of the csv file please see ImportProductSetsGcsSource.csv_file_uri.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project in which the ProductSets should be imported. Format is `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the `ImportProductSets` method.
  &quot;inputConfig&quot;: { # The input content for the `ImportProductSets` method. # Required. The input content for the list of requests.
    &quot;gcsSource&quot;: { # The Google Cloud Storage location for a csv file which preserves a list of ImportProductSetRequests in each line. # The Google Cloud Storage location for a csv file which preserves a list of ImportProductSetRequests in each line.
      &quot;csvFileUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Google Cloud Storage URI of the input csv file. The URI must start with `gs://`. The format of the input csv file should be one image per line. In each line, there are 8 columns. 1. image-uri 2. image-id 3. product-set-id 4. product-id 5. product-category 6. product-display-name 7. labels 8. bounding-poly The `image-uri`, `product-set-id`, `product-id`, and `product-category` columns are required. All other columns are optional. If the `ProductSet` or `Product` specified by the `product-set-id` and `product-id` values does not exist, then the system will create a new `ProductSet` or `Product` for the image. In this case, the `product-display-name` column refers to display_name, the `product-category` column refers to product_category, and the `labels` column refers to product_labels. The `image-id` column is optional but must be unique if provided. If it is empty, the system will automatically assign a unique id to the image. The `product-display-name` column is optional. If it is empty, the system sets the display_name field for the product to a space (&quot; &quot;). You can update the `display_name` later by using the API. If a `Product` with the specified `product-id` already exists, then the system ignores the `product-display-name`, `product-category`, and `labels` columns. The `labels` column (optional) is a line containing a list of comma-separated key-value pairs, in the following format: &quot;key_1=value_1,key_2=value_2,...,key_n=value_n&quot; The `bounding-poly` column (optional) identifies one region of interest from the image in the same manner as `CreateReferenceImage`. If you do not specify the `bounding-poly` column, then the system will try to detect regions of interest automatically. At most one `bounding-poly` column is allowed per line. If the image contains multiple regions of interest, add a line to the CSV file that includes the same product information, and the `bounding-poly` values for each region of interest. The `bounding-poly` column must contain an even number of comma-separated numbers, in the format &quot;p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y&quot;. Use non-negative integers for absolute bounding polygons, and float values in [0, 1] for normalized bounding polygons. The system will resize the image if the image resolution is too large to process (larger than 20MP).

  updateMask: string, The FieldMask that specifies which fields to update. If update_mask isn&#x27;t specified, all mutable fields are to be updated. Valid mask path is `display_name`.

It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Output only. If there was an error with indexing the product set, the field is populated. This field is ignored when creating a ProductSet.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="removeProduct">removeProduct(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Removes a Product from the specified ProductSet.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name for the ProductSet to modify. Format is: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the `RemoveProductFromProductSet` method.
  &quot;product&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource name for the Product to be removed from this ProductSet. Format is: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/products/PRODUCT_ID`
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
