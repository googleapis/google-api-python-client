<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="import_">import_(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Asynchronous API that imports a list of reference images to specified product sets based on a list of image information. The google.longrunning.Operation API can be used to keep track of the progress and results of the request. `Operation.metadata` contains `BatchOperationMetadata`. (progress) `Operation.response` contains `ImportProductSetsResponse`. (results) The input source of this method is a csv file on Google Cloud Storage. For the format of the csv file please see ImportProductSetsGcsSource.csv_file_uri.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project in which the ProductSets should be imported. Format is `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the `ImportProductSets` method.
  &quot;inputConfig&quot;: { # The input content for the `ImportProductSets` method. # Required. The input content for the list of requests.
    &quot;gcsSource&quot;: { # The Google Cloud Storage location for a csv file which preserves a list of ImportProductSetRequests in each line. # The Google Cloud Storage location for a csv file which preserves a list of ImportProductSetRequests in each line.
      &quot;csvFileUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Google Cloud Storage URI of the input csv file. The URI must start with `gs://`. The format of the input csv file should be one image per line. In each line, there are 8 columns. 1. image-uri 2. image-id 3. product-set-id 4. product-id 5. product-category 6. product-display-name 7. labels 8. bounding-poly The `image-uri`, `product-set-id`, `product-id`, and `product-category` columns are required. All other columns are optional. If the `ProductSet` or `Product` specified by the `product-set-id` and `product-id` values does not exist, then the system will create a new `ProductSet` or `Product` for the image. In this case, the `product-display-name` column refers to display_name, the `product-category` column refers to product_category, and the `labels` column refers to product_labels. The `image-id` column is optional but must be unique if provided. If it is empty, the system will automatically assign a unique id to the image. The `product-display-name` column is optional. If it is empty, the system sets the display_name field for the product to a space (&quot; &quot;). You can update the `display_name` later by using the API. If a `Product` with the specified `product-id` already exists, then the system ignores the `product-display-name`, `product-category`, and `labels` columns. The `labels` column (optional) is a line containing a list of comma-separated key-value pairs, in the following format: &quot;key_1=value_1,key_2=value_2,...,key_n=value_n&quot; The `bounding-poly` column (optional) identifies one region of interest from the image in the same manner as `CreateReferenceImage`. If you do not specify the `bounding-poly` column, then the system will try to detect regions of interest automatically. At most one `bounding-poly` column is allowed per line. If the image contains multiple regions of interest, add a line to the CSV file that includes the same product information, and the `bounding-poly` values for each region of interest. The `bounding-poly` column must contain an even number of comma-separated numbers, in the format &quot;p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y&quot;. Use non-negative integers for absolute bounding polygons, and float values in [0, 1] for normalized bounding polygons. The system will resize the image if the image resolution is too large to process (larger than 20MP).

If this ProductSet has never been indexed, this timestamp is the default value &quot;1970-01-01T00:00:00Z&quot;. This field is ignored when creating a ProductSet.

  updateMask: string, The FieldMask that specifies which fields to update. If update_mask isn&#x27;t specified, all mutable fields are to be updated. Valid mask path is `display_name`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Output only. If there was an error with indexing the product set, the field is populated. This field is ignored when creating a ProductSet.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="removeProduct">removeProduct(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Removes a Product from the specified ProductSet.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name for the ProductSet to modify. Format is: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the `RemoveProductFromProductSet` method.
  &quot;product&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource name for the Product to be removed from this ProductSet. Format is: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/products/PRODUCT_ID`
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
