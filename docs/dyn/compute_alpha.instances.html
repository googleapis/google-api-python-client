  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves aggregated list of instances.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of instances contained within the specified zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="listReferrers">listReferrers(project, zone, instance, orderBy=None, filter=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of referrers to instances contained within the specified zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the target instance scoping this request, or '-' if the request should span over all instances in the container. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

Returns:

    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

  instance: string, The instance name for this request. (required)
  networkInterface: string, The name of the network interface to update. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A network interface resource attached to an instance.

      "ipCidrRange": "A String", # The IP CIDR range represented by this alias IP range. This IP CIDR range must belong to the specified subnetwork and cannot contain IP addresses reserved by system or used by other network interfaces. This range may be a single IP address (e.g. 10.2.3.4), a netmask (e.g. /24) or a CIDR format string (e.g. 10.1.2.0/24).
    },
  ],
  "network": "A String", # URL of the network resource for this instance. When creating an instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified, the default network global/networks/default is used; if the network is not specified but the subnetwork is specified, the network is inferred.

      "publicDnsName": "A String", # [Output Only] The public DNS domain name for the instance.
      "networkTier": "A String", # This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this access configuration and can only take the following values: PREMIUM , SELECT. If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
      "natIP": "A String", # An external IP address associated with this instance. Specify an unused static external IP address available to the project or leave this field undefined to use an IP from a shared ephemeral IP address pool. If you specify a static external IP address, it must live in the same region as the zone of the instance.
      "setPublicPtr": True or False, # Specifies whether a public DNS ?PTR? record should be created to map the external IP address of the instance to a DNS domain name.
      "type": "ONE_TO_ONE_NAT", # The type of configuration. The default and only option is ONE_TO_ONE_NAT.
      "publicPtrDomainName": "A String", # The DNS domain name for the public PTR record. This field can only be set when the set_public_ptr field is enabled.
    },
  ],
  "networkIP": "A String", # An IPv4 internal network address to assign to the instance for this network interface. If not specified by the user, an unused internal IP is assigned by the system.
  "fingerprint": "A String", # Fingerprint hash of contents stored in this network interface. This field will be ignored when inserting an Instance or adding a NetworkInterface. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the NetworkInterface.
  "subnetwork": "A String", # The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance. If the network resource is in legacy mode, do not provide this property. If the network is in auto subnet mode, providing the subnetwork is optional. If the network is in custom subnet mode, then this field should be specified. If you specify this property, you can specify the subnetwork as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:
      # - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork
      # - regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork
  "name": "A String", # [Output Only] The name of the network interface, generated by the server. For network devices, these are eth0, eth1, etc.
