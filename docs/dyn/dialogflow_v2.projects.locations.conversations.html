Only set it if you cannot wait for the response to return a auto-generated one to you. The conversation ID must be compliant with the regression fomula &quot;a-zA-Z*&quot; with the characters length in range of [3,64]. If the field is provided, the caller is resposible for 1. the uniqueness of the ID, otherwise the request will be rejected. 2. the consistency for whether to use custom ID or not under a project to better ensure uniqueness.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the list of all conversations in the specified project.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project from which to list all conversation. Format: `projects//locations/`. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters conversations listed in the response. In general, the expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value to use for filtering: - The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. - The comparison operator must be either `=`,`!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`. - To filter on multiple expressions, separate the expressions with `AND` or `OR` (omitting both implies `AND`). - For clarity, expressions can be enclosed in parentheses. Only `lifecycle_state` can be filtered on in this way. For example, the following expression only returns `COMPLETED` conversations: `lifecycle_state = &quot;COMPLETED&quot;` For more information about filtering, see [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160).
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of items to return in a single page. By default 100 and at most 1000.
