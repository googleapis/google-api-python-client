  <pre>Lists the InboundSsoAssignments for a `Customer`.

Args:
  filter: string, A CEL expression to filter the results. The only supported filter is filtering by customer. For example: `customer==customers/C0123abc`. Omitting the filter or specifying a filter of `customer==customers/my_customer` will return the assignments for the customer that the caller (authenticated user) belongs to.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of assignments to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If omitted (or defaulted to zero) the server will use a sensible default. This default may change over time. The maximum allowed value is 100, though requests with page_size greater than that will be silently interpreted as having this maximum value. This may increase in the futue.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListInboundSsoAssignments` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListInboundSsoAssignments` must match the call that provided the page token.
