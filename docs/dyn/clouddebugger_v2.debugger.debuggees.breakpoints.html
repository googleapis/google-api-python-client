    &quot;action&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Action that the agent should perform when the code at the breakpoint location is hit.
    &quot;canaryExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The deadline for the breakpoint to stay in CANARY_ACTIVE state. The value is meaningless when the breakpoint is not in CANARY_ACTIVE state.
    &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Condition that triggers the breakpoint. The condition is a compound boolean expression composed using expressions in a programming language at the source location.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time this breakpoint was created by the server in seconds resolution.
    &quot;evaluatedExpressions&quot;: [ # Values of evaluated expressions at breakpoint time. The evaluated expressions appear in exactly the same order they are listed in the `expressions` field. The `name` field holds the original expression text, the `value` or `members` field holds the result of the evaluated expression. If the expression cannot be evaluated, the `status` inside the `Variable` will indicate an error and contain the error text.
      { # Represents a variable or an argument possibly of a compound object type. Note how the following variables are represented: 1) A simple variable: int x = 5 { name: &quot;x&quot;, value: &quot;5&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot; } // Captured variable 2) A compound object: struct T { int m1; int m2; }; T x = { 3, 7 }; { // Captured variable name: &quot;x&quot;, type: &quot;T&quot;, members { name: &quot;m1&quot;, value: &quot;3&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot; }, members { name: &quot;m2&quot;, value: &quot;7&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot; } } 3) A pointer where the pointee was captured: T x = { 3, 7 }; T* p = &amp;x; { // Captured variable name: &quot;p&quot;, type: &quot;T*&quot;, value: &quot;0x00500500&quot;, members { name: &quot;m1&quot;, value: &quot;3&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot; }, members { name: &quot;m2&quot;, value: &quot;7&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot; } } 4) A pointer where the pointee was not captured: T* p = new T; { // Captured variable name: &quot;p&quot;, type: &quot;T*&quot;, value: &quot;0x00400400&quot; status { is_error: true, description { format: &quot;unavailable&quot; } } } The status should describe the reason for the missing value, such as ``, ``, ``. Note that a null pointer should not have members. 5) An unnamed value: int* p = new int(7); { // Captured variable name: &quot;p&quot;, value: &quot;0x00500500&quot;, type: &quot;int*&quot;, members { value: &quot;7&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot; } } 6) An unnamed pointer where the pointee was not captured: int* p = new int(7); int** pp = &amp;p; { // Captured variable name: &quot;pp&quot;, value: &quot;0x00500500&quot;, type: &quot;int**&quot;, members { value: &quot;0x00400400&quot;, type: &quot;int*&quot; status { is_error: true, description: { format: &quot;unavailable&quot; } } } } } To optimize computation, memory and network traffic, variables that repeat in the output multiple times can be stored once in a shared variable table and be referenced using the `var_table_index` field. The variables stored in the shared table are nameless and are essentially a partition of the complete variable. To reconstruct the complete variable, merge the referencing variable with the referenced variable. When using the shared variable table, the following variables: T x = { 3, 7 }; T* p = &amp;x; T&amp; r = x; { name: &quot;x&quot;, var_table_index: 3, type: &quot;T&quot; } // Captured variables { name: &quot;p&quot;, value &quot;0x00500500&quot;, type=&quot;T*&quot;, var_table_index: 3 } { name: &quot;r&quot;, type=&quot;T&amp;&quot;, var_table_index: 3 } { // Shared variable table entry #3: members { name: &quot;m1&quot;, value: &quot;3&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot; }, members { name: &quot;m2&quot;, value: &quot;7&quot;, type: &quot;int&quot; } } Note that the pointer address is stored with the referencing variable and not with the referenced variable. This allows the referenced variable to be shared between pointers and references. The type field is optional. The debugger agent may or may not support it.

  <pre>Lists all breakpoints for the debuggee.

Args:
  debuggeeId: string, Required. ID of the debuggee whose breakpoints to list. (required)
  action_value: string, Only breakpoints with the specified action will pass the filter.
    Allowed values
      CAPTURE - Capture stack frame and variables and update the breakpoint. The data is only captured once. After that the breakpoint is set in a final state.
      LOG - Log each breakpoint hit. The breakpoint remains active until deleted or expired.
  clientVersion: string, Required. The client version making the call. Schema: `domain/type/version` (e.g., `google.com/intellij/v1`).
  includeAllUsers: boolean, When set to `true`, the response includes the list of breakpoints set by any user. Otherwise, it includes only breakpoints set by the caller.
  includeInactive: boolean, When set to `true`, the response includes active and inactive breakpoints. Otherwise, it includes only active breakpoints.
  stripResults: boolean, This field is deprecated. The following fields are always stripped out of the result: `stack_frames`, `evaluated_expressions` and `variable_table`.
  waitToken: string, A wait token that, if specified, blocks the call until the breakpoints list has changed, or a server selected timeout has expired. The value should be set from the last response. The error code `google.rpc.Code.ABORTED` (RPC) is returned on wait timeout, which should be called again with the same `wait_token`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
