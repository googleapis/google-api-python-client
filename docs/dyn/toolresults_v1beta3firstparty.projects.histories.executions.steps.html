  <pre>Creates a Step.

The returned Step will have the id set.

May return any of the following canonical error codes:

- PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to write to project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - FAILED_PRECONDITION - if the step is too large (more than 10Mib) - NOT_FOUND - if the containing Execution does not exist

  projectId: string, A Project id.

Required. (required)
  historyId: string, A History id.

  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Step represents a single operation performed as part of Execution. A step can be used to represent the execution of a tool ( for example a test runner execution or an execution of a compiler).
    # 
    # Steps can overlap (for instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are done in parallel).
    # 
    # Here is an example, let's consider that we have a continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates an TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE
    # 
    # A Step can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable.
  "testExecutionStep": { # A step that represents running tests. # An execution of a test runner.
      #
      # It accepts ant-junit xml files which will be parsed into structured test results by the service. Xml file paths are updated in order to append more files, however they can't be deleted.

      # Users can also add test results manually by using the test_result field.
    "testTiming": { # Testing timing break down to know phases. # The timing break down of the test execution.

It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day" or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years. # How long it took to run the test process.
          #
          # - In response: present if previously set. - In create/update request: optional

The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.

Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.

That is, the format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z" where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
        #
        # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.

  <pre>Lists Steps for a given Execution.

The steps are sorted by creation_time in descending order. The step_id key will be used to order the steps with the same creation_time.

May return any of the following canonical error codes:

- PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to read project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - FAILED_PRECONDITION - if an argument in the request happens to be invalid; e.g. if an attempt is made to list the children of a nonexistent Step - NOT_FOUND - if the containing Execution does not exist

Args:
  projectId: string, A Project id.

Required. (required)
  historyId: string, A History id.

            #

            #
            # Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL)); timestamp.set_nanos(0);
            #
            # Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.
            #
            # struct timeval tv; gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
            #
            # Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec); timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);
            #
            # Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.
            #
            # FILETIME ft; GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft); UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;
            #
            # // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL)); timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));
            #
            # Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
            #
            # long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
            #
            # Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000) .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();
            #

            #
            # Example 5: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.

            # timestamp = Timestamp() timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
            #
            # # JSON Mapping
            #
            # In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z" where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
            #
            # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
            #
            # In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString] method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted to this format using [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.

    "completionTime": { # A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or calendar, represented as seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution in UTC Epoch time. It is encoded using the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes are 60 seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation. Range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from RFC 3339 date strings. See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). # The time when the step status was set to complete.

        # # Examples
        #
        # Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.
        #
        # Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL)); timestamp.set_nanos(0);
        #
        # Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.
        #
        # struct timeval tv; gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
        #
        # Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec); timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);
        #
        # Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.
        #
        # FILETIME ft; GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft); UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;
        #
        # // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL)); timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));
        #
        # Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
        #
        # long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        #
        # Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000) .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();
        #
        #
        #
        # Example 5: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.
        #
        # timestamp = Timestamp() timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
        #
        # # JSON Mapping
        #
        # In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z" where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
        #
        # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
        #
        # In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString] method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted to this format using [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.
