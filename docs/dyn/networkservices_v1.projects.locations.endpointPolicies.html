  <pre>Creates a new EndpointPolicy in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the EndpointPolicy. Must be in the format `projects/*/locations/global`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # EndpointPolicy is a resource that helps apply desired configuration on the endpoints that match specific criteria. For example, this resource can be used to apply &quot;authentication config&quot; an all endpoints that serve on port 8080.
  &quot;authorizationPolicy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. This field specifies the URL of AuthorizationPolicy resource that applies authorization policies to the inbound traffic at the matched endpoints. Refer to Authorization. If this field is not specified, authorization is disabled(no authz checks) for this endpoint.
  &quot;clientTlsPolicy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A URL referring to a ClientTlsPolicy resource. ClientTlsPolicy can be set to specify the authentication for traffic from the proxy to the actual endpoints. More specifically, it is applied to the outgoing traffic from the proxy to the endpoint. This is typically used for sidecar model where the proxy identifies itself as endpoint to the control plane, with the connection between sidecar and endpoint requiring authentication. If this field is not set, authentication is disabled(open). Applicable only when EndpointPolicyType is SIDECAR_PROXY.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A free-text description of the resource. Max length 1024 characters.
  &quot;endpointMatcher&quot;: { # A definition of a matcher that selects endpoints to which the policies should be applied. # Required. A matcher that selects endpoints to which the policies should be applied.

      &quot;metadataLabelMatchCriteria&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies how matching should be done. Supported values are: MATCH_ANY: At least one of the Labels specified in the matcher should match the metadata presented by xDS client. MATCH_ALL: The metadata presented by the xDS client should contain all of the labels specified here. The selection is determined based on the best match. For example, suppose there are three EndpointPolicy resources P1, P2 and P3 and if P1 has a the matcher as MATCH_ANY , P2 has MATCH_ALL , and P3 has MATCH_ALL . If a client with label connects, the config from P1 will be selected. If a client with label connects, the config from P2 will be selected. If a client with label connects, the config from P3 will be selected. If there is more than one best match, (for example, if a config P4 with selector exists and if a client with label connects), pick up the one with older creation time.
      &quot;metadataLabels&quot;: [ # The list of label value pairs that must match labels in the provided metadata based on filterMatchCriteria This list can have at most 64 entries.

  &quot;serverTlsPolicy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A URL referring to ServerTlsPolicy resource. ServerTlsPolicy is used to determine the authentication policy to be applied to terminate the inbound traffic at the identified backends. If this field is not set, authentication is disabled(open) for this endpoint.
  &quot;trafficPortSelector&quot;: { # Specification of a port-based selector. # Optional. Port selector for the (matched) endpoints. If no port selector is provided, the matched config is applied to all ports.
    &quot;ports&quot;: [ # Optional. A list of ports. Can be port numbers or port range (example, [80-90] specifies all ports from 80 to 90, including 80 and 90) or named ports or * to specify all ports. If the list is empty, all ports are selected.
      &quot;A String&quot;,

For example, suppose there are three EndpointPolicy resources P1, P2 and P3 and if P1 has a the matcher as MATCH_ANY , P2 has MATCH_ALL , and P3 has MATCH_ALL . If a client with label connects, the config from P1 will be selected. If a client with label connects, the config from P2 will be selected. If a client with label connects, the config from P3 will be selected. If there is more than one best match, (for example, if a config P4 with selector exists and if a client with label connects), pick up the one with older creation time.
      &quot;metadataLabels&quot;: [ # The list of label value pairs that must match labels in the provided metadata based on filterMatchCriteria This list can have at most 64 entries. The list can be empty if the match criteria is MATCH_ANY, to specify a wildcard match (i.e this matches any client).
        { # Defines a name-pair value for a single label.
          &quot;labelName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Label name presented as key in xDS Node Metadata.
          &quot;labelValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Label value presented as value corresponding to the above key, in xDS Node Metadata.
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Set of label tags associated with the EndpointPolicy resource.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. Name of the EndpointPolicy resource. It matches pattern `projects/{project}/locations/global/endpointPolicies/{endpoint_policy}`.
  &quot;serverTlsPolicy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A URL referring to ServerTlsPolicy resource. ServerTlsPolicy is used to determine the authentication policy to be applied to terminate the inbound traffic at the identified backends. If this field is not set, authentication is disabled(open) for this endpoint.
  &quot;trafficPortSelector&quot;: { # Specification of a port-based selector. # Optional. Port selector for the (matched) endpoints. If no port selector is provided, the matched config is applied to all ports.
    &quot;ports&quot;: [ # Optional. A list of ports. Can be port numbers or port range (example, [80-90] specifies all ports from 80 to 90, including 80 and 90) or named ports or * to specify all ports. If the list is empty, all ports are selected.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The type of endpoint policy. This is primarily used to validate the configuration.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was updated.
}

  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the EndpointPolicy resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
