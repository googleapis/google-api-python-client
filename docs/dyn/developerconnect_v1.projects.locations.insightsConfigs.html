<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, etag=None, requestId=None, validateOnly=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Delete a single Insight.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Value for parent. (required)
  etag: string, Optional. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, validate the request, but do not actually post it.

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set to true, and the insightsConfig is not found a new insightsConfig will be created. In this situation `update_mask` is ignored. The creation will succeed only if the input insightsConfig has all the necessary information (e.g a github_config with both user_oauth_token and installation_id properties).
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, validate the request, but do not actually post it.

      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
