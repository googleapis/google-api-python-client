  <pre>Analyze heathcare entity in a document. Its response includes the recognized entity mentions and the relationships between them. AnalyzeEntities uses context aware models to detect entities.

Args:
  nlpService: string, The resource name of the service of the form: &quot;projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/services/nlp&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request to analyze healthcare entities in a document.
  &quot;documentContent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # document_content is a document to be annotated.
  &quot;licensedVocabularies&quot;: [ # A list of licensed vocabularies to use in the request, in addition to the default unlicensed vocabularies.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Includes recognized entity mentions and relationships between them.
  &quot;entities&quot;: [ # The union of all the candidate entities that the entity_mentions in this response could link to. These are UMLS concepts or normalized mention content.
    { # The candidate entities that an entity mention could link to.
