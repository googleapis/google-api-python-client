The format is a full resource name of the resource without the prefix double slashes in the API service name part of the full resource name. This allows retrieval of entries using their associated resource name.For example, if the full resource name of a resource is //library.googleapis.com/shelves/shelf1/books/book2, then the suggested entry_id is library.googleapis.com/shelves/shelf1/books/book2.It is also suggested to follow the same convention for entries corresponding to resources from providers or systems other than Google Cloud.The maximum size of the field is 4000 characters.
