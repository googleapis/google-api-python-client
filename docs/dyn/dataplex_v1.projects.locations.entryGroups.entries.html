This allows retrieval of entries using their associated resource name.For example if the Full Resource Name of a resource is //library.googleapis.com/shelves/shelf1/books/book2, then the suggested entry_id is library.googleapis.com/shelves/shelf1/books/book2.It is also suggested to follow the same convention for entries corresponding to resources from other providers or systems than Google Cloud.The maximum size of the field is 4000 characters.
