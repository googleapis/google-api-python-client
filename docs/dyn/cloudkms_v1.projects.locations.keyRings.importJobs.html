  <pre>Create a new ImportJob within a KeyRing.

ImportJob.import_method is required.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the KeyRing associated with the
ImportJobs. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An ImportJob can be used to create CryptoKeys and
    # CryptoKeyVersions using pre-existing key material,
    # generated outside of Cloud KMS.
    # 
    # When an ImportJob is created, Cloud KMS will generate a "wrapping key",
    # which is a public/private key pair. You use the wrapping key to encrypt (also
    # known as wrap) the pre-existing key material to protect it during the import
    # process. The nature of the wrapping key depends on the choice of
    # import_method. When the wrapping key generation
    # is complete, the state will be set to
    # ACTIVE and the public_key
    # can be fetched. The fetched public key can then be used to wrap your
    # pre-existing key material.
    # 
    # Once the key material is wrapped, it can be imported into a new
    # CryptoKeyVersion in an existing CryptoKey by calling
    # ImportCryptoKeyVersion.
    # Multiple CryptoKeyVersions can be imported with a single
    # ImportJob. Cloud KMS uses the private key portion of the wrapping key to
    # unwrap the key material. Only Cloud KMS has access to the private key.
    # 
    # An ImportJob expires 3 days after it is created. Once expired, Cloud KMS
    # will no longer be able to import or unwrap any key material that was wrapped

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
