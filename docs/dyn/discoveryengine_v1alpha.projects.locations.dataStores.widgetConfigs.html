<div class="method">

  <pre>Gets a WidgetConfig.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Full WidgetConfig resource name. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection_id}/dataStores/{data_store_id}/widgetConfigs/{widget_config_id}` (required)
  acceptCache: boolean, Optional. Whether it&#x27;s acceptable to load the widget config from cache. If set to true, recent changes on widget configs may take a few minutes to reflect on the end user&#x27;s view. It&#x27;s recommended to set to true for maturely developed widgets, as it improves widget performance. Set to false to see changes reflected in prod right away, if your widget is under development.
  getWidgetConfigRequestOption_turnOffCollectionComponents: boolean, Optional. Whether to turn off collection_components in WidgetConfig to reduce latency and data transmission.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

      &quot;maxExtractiveAnswerCount&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of extractive answers returned in each search result. An extractive answer is a verbatim answer extracted from the original document, which provides a precise and contextually relevant answer to the search query. If the number of matching answers is less than the `max_extractive_answer_count`, return all of the answers. Otherwise, return the `max_extractive_answer_count`. At most five answers are returned for each SearchResult.
      &quot;maxExtractiveSegmentCount&quot;: 42, # The max number of extractive segments returned in each search result. Only applied if the DataStore is set to DataStore.ContentConfig.CONTENT_REQUIRED or DataStore.solution_types is SOLUTION_TYPE_CHAT. An extractive segment is a text segment extracted from the original document that is relevant to the search query, and, in general, more verbose than an extractive answer. The segment could then be used as input for LLMs to generate summaries and answers. If the number of matching segments is less than `max_extractive_segment_count`, return all of the segments. Otherwise, return the `max_extractive_segment_count`.

    },

      &quot;ignoreAdversarialQuery&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to filter out adversarial queries. The default value is `false`. Google employs search-query classification to detect adversarial queries. No summary is returned if the search query is classified as an adversarial query. For example, a user might ask a question regarding negative comments about the company or submit a query designed to generate unsafe, policy-violating output. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating summaries for adversarial queries and return fallback messages instead.
      &quot;ignoreJailBreakingQuery&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Specifies whether to filter out jail-breaking queries. The default value is `false`. Google employs search-query classification to detect jail-breaking queries. No summary is returned if the search query is classified as a jail-breaking query. A user might add instructions to the query to change the tone, style, language, content of the answer, or ask the model to act as a different entity, e.g. &quot;Reply in the tone of a competing company&#x27;s CEO&quot;. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating summaries for jail-breaking queries and return fallback messages instead.
      &quot;ignoreLowRelevantContent&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to filter out queries that have low relevance. The default value is `false`. If this field is set to `false`, all search results are used regardless of relevance to generate answers. If set to `true`, only queries with high relevance search results will generate answers.
      &quot;ignoreNonSummarySeekingQuery&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to filter out queries that are not summary-seeking. The default value is `false`. Google employs search-query classification to detect summary-seeking queries. No summary is returned if the search query is classified as a non-summary seeking query. For example, `why is the sky blue` and `Who is the best soccer player in the world?` are summary-seeking queries, but `SFO airport` and `world cup 2026` are not. They are most likely navigational queries. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating summaries for non-summary seeking queries and return fallback messages instead.
      &quot;includeCitations&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to include citations in the summary. The default value is `false`. When this field is set to `true`, summaries include in-line citation numbers. Example summary including citations: BigQuery is Google Cloud&#x27;s fully managed and completely serverless enterprise data warehouse [1]. BigQuery supports all data types, works across clouds, and has built-in machine learning and business intelligence, all within a unified platform [2, 3]. The citation numbers refer to the returned search results and are 1-indexed. For example, [1] means that the sentence is attributed to the first search result. [2, 3] means that the sentence is attributed to both the second and third search results.
      &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Language code for Summary. Use language tags defined by [BCP47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt). Note: This is an experimental feature.

      },
      &quot;summaryResultCount&quot;: 42, # The number of top results to generate the summary from. If the number of results returned is less than `summaryResultCount`, the summary is generated from all of the results. At most 10 results for documents mode, or 50 for chunks mode, can be used to generate a summary. The chunks mode is used when SearchRequest.ContentSearchSpec.search_result_mode is set to CHUNKS.
      &quot;useSemanticChunks&quot;: True or False, # If true, answer will be generated from most relevant chunks from top search results. This feature will improve summary quality. Note that with this feature enabled, not all top search results will be referenced and included in the reference list, so the citation source index only points to the search results listed in the reference list.
