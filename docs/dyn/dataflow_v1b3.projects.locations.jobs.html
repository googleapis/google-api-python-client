  <pre>Creates a Cloud Dataflow job. To create a job, we recommend using `projects.locations.jobs.create` with a [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints). Using `projects.jobs.create` is not recommended, as your job will always start in `us-central1`. Do not enter confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

Args:
  projectId: string, The ID of the Cloud Platform project that the job belongs to. (required)
  location: string, The [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) that contains this job. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Defines a job to be run by the Cloud Dataflow service. Do not enter confidential information when you supply string values using the API.
  &quot;clientRequestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The client&#x27;s unique identifier of the job, re-used across retried attempts. If this field is set, the service will ensure its uniqueness. The request to create a job will fail if the service has knowledge of a previously submitted job with the same client&#x27;s ID and job name. The caller may use this field to ensure idempotence of job creation across retried attempts to create a job. By default, the field is empty and, in that case, the service ignores it.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp when the job was initially created. Immutable and set by the Cloud Dataflow service.
  &quot;createdFromSnapshotId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If this is specified, the job&#x27;s initial state is populated from the given snapshot.
  &quot;currentState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The current state of the job. Jobs are created in the `JOB_STATE_STOPPED` state unless otherwise specified. A job in the `JOB_STATE_RUNNING` state may asynchronously enter a terminal state. After a job has reached a terminal state, no further state updates may be made. This field may be mutated by the Cloud Dataflow service; callers cannot mutate it.
  &quot;currentStateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp associated with the current state.
  &quot;environment&quot;: { # Describes the environment in which a Dataflow Job runs. # The environment for the job.
    &quot;clusterManagerApiService&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of cluster manager API to use. If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default. This should be in the form of the API service name, e.g. &quot;compute.googleapis.com&quot;.
    &quot;dataset&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The dataset for the current project where various workflow related tables are stored. The supported resource type is: Google BigQuery: bigquery.googleapis.com/{dataset}
    &quot;debugOptions&quot;: { # Describes any options that have an effect on the debugging of pipelines. # Any debugging options to be supplied to the job.

      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object.
    },
    &quot;serviceAccountEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identity to run virtual machines as. Defaults to the default account.
    &quot;serviceKmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If set, contains the Cloud KMS key identifier used to encrypt data at rest, AKA a Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK). Format: projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/keyRings/KEY_RING/cryptoKeys/KEY
    &quot;serviceOptions&quot;: [ # The list of service options to enable. This field should be used for service related experiments only. These experiments, when graduating to GA, should be replaced by dedicated fields or become default (i.e. always on).
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;shuffleMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The shuffle mode used for the job.
    &quot;tempStoragePrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The prefix of the resources the system should use for temporary storage. The system will append the suffix &quot;/temp-{JOBNAME} to this resource prefix, where {JOBNAME} is the value of the job_name field. The resulting bucket and object prefix is used as the prefix of the resources used to store temporary data needed during the job execution. NOTE: This will override the value in taskrunner_settings. The supported resource type is: Google Cloud Storage: storage.googleapis.com/{bucket}/{object} bucket.storage.googleapis.com/{object}
    &quot;userAgent&quot;: { # A description of the process that generated the request.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object.
    },

    },
    &quot;workerPools&quot;: [ # The worker pools. At least one &quot;harness&quot; worker pool must be specified in order for the job to have workers.
      { # Describes one particular pool of Cloud Dataflow workers to be instantiated by the Cloud Dataflow service in order to perform the computations required by a job. Note that a workflow job may use multiple pools, in order to match the various computational requirements of the various stages of the job.

          { # Describes the data disk used by a workflow job.
            &quot;diskType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Disk storage type, as defined by Google Compute Engine. This must be a disk type appropriate to the project and zone in which the workers will run. If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default. For example, the standard persistent disk type is a resource name typically ending in &quot;pd-standard&quot;. If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with &quot;pd-ssd&quot;. The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Cloud Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone. Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this: compute.googleapis.com/projects/project-id/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard
            &quot;mountPoint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Directory in a VM where disk is mounted.

Note that the Cloud Dataflow service may be used to run many different types of jobs, not just Map-Reduce.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(projectId, location, jobId, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the state of the specified Cloud Dataflow job. To get the state of a job, we recommend using `projects.locations.jobs.get` with a [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints). Using `projects.jobs.get` is not recommended, as you can only get the state of jobs that are running in `us-central1`.

Args:
  projectId: string, The ID of the Cloud Platform project that the job belongs to. (required)
  location: string, The [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) that contains this job. (required)
  jobId: string, The job ID. (required)
  view: string, The level of information requested in response.
    Allowed values
      JOB_VIEW_UNKNOWN - The job view to return isn&#x27;t specified, or is unknown. Responses will contain at least the `JOB_VIEW_SUMMARY` information, and may contain additional information.
      JOB_VIEW_SUMMARY - Request summary information only: Project ID, Job ID, job name, job type, job status, start/end time, and Cloud SDK version details.
      JOB_VIEW_ALL - Request all information available for this job.
      JOB_VIEW_DESCRIPTION - Request summary info and limited job description data for steps, labels and environment.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;clientRequestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The client&#x27;s unique identifier of the job, re-used across retried attempts. If this field is set, the service will ensure its uniqueness. The request to create a job will fail if the service has knowledge of a previously submitted job with the same client&#x27;s ID and job name. The caller may use this field to ensure idempotence of job creation across retried attempts to create a job. By default, the field is empty and, in that case, the service ignores it.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(projectId, location, filter=None, name=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>List the jobs of a project. To list the jobs of a project in a region, we recommend using `projects.locations.jobs.list` with a [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints). To list the all jobs across all regions, use `projects.jobs.aggregated`. Using `projects.jobs.list` is not recommended, as you can only get the list of jobs that are running in `us-central1`.

Args:
  projectId: string, The project which owns the jobs. (required)
  location: string, The [regional endpoint] (https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) that contains this job. (required)
  filter: string, The kind of filter to use.
    Allowed values
      UNKNOWN - The filter isn&#x27;t specified, or is unknown. This returns all jobs ordered on descending `JobUuid`.
      ALL - Returns all running jobs first ordered on creation timestamp, then returns all terminated jobs ordered on the termination timestamp.
      TERMINATED - Filters the jobs that have a terminated state, ordered on the termination timestamp. Example terminated states: `JOB_STATE_STOPPED`, `JOB_STATE_UPDATED`, `JOB_STATE_DRAINED`, etc.
      ACTIVE - Filters the jobs that are running ordered on the creation timestamp.
  name: string, Optional. The job name. Optional.
  pageSize: integer, If there are many jobs, limit response to at most this many. The actual number of jobs returned will be the lesser of max_responses and an unspecified server-defined limit.
  pageToken: string, Set this to the &#x27;next_page_token&#x27; field of a previous response to request additional results in a long list.
  view: string, Deprecated. ListJobs always returns summaries now. Use GetJob for other JobViews.
    Allowed values
      JOB_VIEW_UNKNOWN - The job view to return isn&#x27;t specified, or is unknown. Responses will contain at least the `JOB_VIEW_SUMMARY` information, and may contain additional information.
      JOB_VIEW_SUMMARY - Request summary information only: Project ID, Job ID, job name, job type, job status, start/end time, and Cloud SDK version details.
      JOB_VIEW_ALL - Request all information available for this job.
      JOB_VIEW_DESCRIPTION - Request summary info and limited job description data for steps, labels and environment.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
