  <pre>Creates a Cloud Dataflow job.

To create a job, we recommend using `projects.locations.jobs.create` with a
[regional endpoint]
(https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints). Using
`projects.jobs.create` is not recommended, as your job will always start
in `us-central1`.

Args:
  projectId: string, The ID of the Cloud Platform project that the job belongs to. (required)
  location: string, The [regional endpoint]
(https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) that
contains this job. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Defines a job to be run by the Cloud Dataflow service.
  "labels": { # User-defined labels for this job.
      # 
      # The labels map can contain no more than 64 entries.  Entries of the labels

      # 
      # * Keys must conform to regexp:  \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62}

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(projectId, location, jobId, x__xgafv=None, view=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the state of the specified Cloud Dataflow job.

To get the state of a job, we recommend using `projects.locations.jobs.get`
with a [regional endpoint]
(https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints). Using
`projects.jobs.get` is not recommended, as you can only get the state of
jobs that are running in `us-central1`.

Args:
  projectId: string, The ID of the Cloud Platform project that the job belongs to. (required)
  location: string, The [regional endpoint]
(https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) that
contains this job. (required)
  jobId: string, The job ID. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  view: string, The level of information requested in response.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Defines a job to be run by the Cloud Dataflow service.
    "labels": { # User-defined labels for this job.

`projects.locations.jobs.getMetrics` with a [regional endpoint]
(https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints). Using
`projects.jobs.getMetrics` is not recommended, as you can only request the
status of jobs that are running in `us-central1`.

Args:
  projectId: string, A project id. (required)
  location: string, The [regional endpoint]
(https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) that
contains the job specified by job_id. (required)
  jobId: string, The job to get messages for. (required)
  startTime: string, Return only metric data that has changed since this time.
Default is to return all information about all metrics for the job.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  <pre>List the jobs of a project.

To list the jobs of a project in a region, we recommend using
`projects.locations.jobs.get` with a [regional endpoint]
(https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints). To
list the all jobs across all regions, use `projects.jobs.aggregated`. Using
`projects.jobs.list` is not recommended, as you can only get the list of
jobs that are running in `us-central1`.

  location: string, The [regional endpoint]
(https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints) that
contains this job. (required)
  pageSize: integer, If there are many jobs, limit response to at most this many.
The actual number of jobs returned will be the lesser of max_responses
and an unspecified server-defined limit.
  pageToken: string, Set this to the 'next_page_token' field of a previous response
to request additional results in a long list.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, The kind of filter to use.
