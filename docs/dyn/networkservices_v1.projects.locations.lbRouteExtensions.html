  <pre>Creates a new `LbRouteExtension` resource in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the `LbRouteExtension` resource. Must be in the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. (required)

    The object takes the form of:

{ # `LbRouteExtension` is a resource that lets you control where traffic is routed to for a given request.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A human-readable description of the resource.
  &quot;extensionChains&quot;: [ # Required. A set of ordered extension chains that contain the match conditions and extensions to execute. Match conditions for each extension chain are evaluated in sequence for a given request. The first extension chain that has a condition that matches the request is executed. Any subsequent extension chains do not execute. Limited to 5 extension chains per resource.
    { # A single extension chain wrapper that contains the match conditions and extensions to execute.
      &quot;extensions&quot;: [ # Required. A set of extensions to execute for the matching request. At least one extension is required.

When set to `TRUE`, request or response processing continues without error. Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also executed. When set to `FALSE` or the default setting of `FALSE` is used, one of the following happens: * If response headers have not been delivered to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the client. The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error response in the load balancer. * If response headers have been delivered, then the HTTP stream to the downstream client is reset.
          &quot;forwardHeaders&quot;: [ # Optional. List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the client or backend). If omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a string indicating the header name.

          &quot;service&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The reference to the service that runs the extension. Currently only callout extensions are supported here. To configure a callout extension, `service` must be a fully-qualified reference to a [backend service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendServices) in the format: `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{region}/backendServices/{backendService}` or `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/backendServices/{backendService}`.
          &quot;supportedEvents&quot;: [ # Optional. A set of events during request or response processing for which this extension is called. This field is required for the `LbTrafficExtension` resource. It must not be set for the `LbRouteExtension` resource.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;timeout&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies the timeout for each individual message on the stream. The timeout must be between 10-1000 milliseconds. Required for Callout extensions.
        },
      ],
      &quot;matchCondition&quot;: { # Conditions under which this chain is invoked for a request. # Required. Conditions under which this chain is invoked for a request.
        &quot;celExpression&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A Common Expression Language (CEL) expression that is used to match requests for which the extension chain is executed. For more information, see [CEL matcher language reference](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/cel-matcher-language-reference).
      },
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name for this extension chain. The name is logged as part of the HTTP request logs. The name must conform with RFC-1034, is restricted to lower-cased letters, numbers and hyphens, and can have a maximum length of 63 characters. Additionally, the first character must be a letter and the last a letter or a number.
    },
  ],
  &quot;forwardingRules&quot;: [ # Required. A list of references to the forwarding rules to which this service extension is attached to. At least one forwarding rule is required. There can be only one `LbRouteExtension` resource per forwarding rule.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Set of labels associated with the `LbRouteExtension` resource. The format must comply with [the requirements for labels](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources#requirements) for Google Cloud resources.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;loadBalancingScheme&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. All backend services and forwarding rules referenced by this extension must share the same load balancing scheme.

  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Optional. The metadata provided here is included as part of the `metadata_context` (of type `google.protobuf.Struct`) in the `ProcessingRequest` message sent to the extension server. The metadata is available under the namespace `com.google.lb_route_extension.`.

    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Identifier. Name of the `LbRouteExtension` resource in the following format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/lbRouteExtensions/{lb_route_extension}`.

}

  lbRouteExtensionId: string, Required. User-provided ID of the `LbRouteExtension` resource to be created.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server can ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server can ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Optional. Used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `LbRouteExtension` resource by the update. The fields specified in the `update_mask` are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field is overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not specify a mask, then all fields are overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
