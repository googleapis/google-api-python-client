<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchGet">batchGet(parent, names=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Atomically gets the DeviceCheckConfigs for the specified list of apps. For security reasons, the `private_key` field is never populated in the response.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent project name shared by all DeviceCheckConfigs being retrieved, in the format ``` projects/{project_number} ``` The parent collection in the `name` field of any resource being retrieved must match this field, or the entire batch fails. (required)
  names: string, Required. The relative resource names of the DeviceCheckConfigs to retrieve, in the format ``` projects/{project_number}/apps/{app_id}/deviceCheckConfig ``` A maximum of 100 objects can be retrieved in a batch. (repeated)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
