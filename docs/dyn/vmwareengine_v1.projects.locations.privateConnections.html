  <pre>Creates a new private connection that can be used for accessing private Clouds.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the location to create the new private connection in. Private connection is a regional resource. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Private connection resource that provides connectivity for VMware Engine private clouds.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of this resource.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. User-provided description for this private connection.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the private connection. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/privateConnections/my-connection`
  &quot;peeringId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. VPC network peering id between given network VPC and VMwareEngineNetwork.
  &quot;peeringState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Peering state between service network and VMware Engine network.
  &quot;routingMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Routing Mode. Default value is set to GLOBAL. For type = PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS, this field can be set to GLOBAL or REGIONAL, for other types only GLOBAL is supported.
  &quot;serviceNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Service network to create private connection. Specify the name in the following form: `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network_id}` For type = PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS, this field represents servicenetworking VPC, e.g. projects/project-tp/global/networks/servicenetworking. For type = NETAPP_CLOUD_VOLUME, this field represents NetApp service VPC, e.g. projects/project-tp/global/networks/netapp-tenant-vpc. For type = DELL_POWERSCALE, this field represent Dell service VPC, e.g. projects/project-tp/global/networks/dell-tenant-vpc. For type= THIRD_PARTY_SERVICE, this field could represent a consumer VPC or any other producer VPC to which the VMware Engine Network needs to be connected, e.g. projects/project/global/networks/vpc.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the private connection.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Private connection type.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. System-generated unique identifier for the resource.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of this resource.
  &quot;vmwareEngineNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The relative resource name of Legacy VMware Engine network. Specify the name in the following form: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}` where `{project}`, `{location}` will be same as specified in private connection resource name and `{vmware_engine_network_id}` will be in the form of `{location}`-default e.g. projects/project/locations/us-central1/vmwareEngineNetworks/us-central1-default.
  &quot;vmwareEngineNetworkCanonical&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The canonical name of the VMware Engine network in the form: `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}`
}

  privateConnectionId: string, Required. The user-provided identifier of the new private connection. This identifier must be unique among private connection resources within the parent and becomes the final token in the name URI. The identifier must meet the following requirements: * Only contains 1-63 alphanumeric characters and hyphens * Begins with an alphabetical character * Ends with a non-hyphen character * Not formatted as a UUID * Complies with [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) (section 3.5)
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of this resource.
  &quot;vmwareEngineNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The relative resource name of Legacy VMware Engine network. Specify the name in the following form: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}` where `{project}`, `{location}` will be same as specified in private connection resource name and `{vmware_engine_network_id}` will be in the form of `{location}`-default e.g. projects/project/locations/us-central1/vmwareEngineNetworks/us-central1-default.
  &quot;vmwareEngineNetworkCanonical&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The canonical name of the VMware Engine network in the form: `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}`
}

  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `PrivateConnection` resource by the update. The fields specified in the `update_mask` are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
