List items can also include pre-built or custom classes containing groups of words that represent common concepts that occur in natural language. For example, rather than providing a phrase hint for every month of the year (e.g. &quot;i was born in january&quot;, &quot;i was born in febuary&quot;, ...), use the pre-built `$MONTH` class improves the likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes months (e.g. &quot;i was born in $month&quot;). To refer to pre-built classes, use the class&#x27; symbol prepended with `$` e.g. `$MONTH`. To refer to custom classes that were defined inline in the request, set the class&#x27;s `custom_class_id` to a string unique to all class resources and inline classes. Then use the class&#x27; id wrapped in $`{...}` e.g. &quot;${my-months}&quot;. To refer to custom classes resources, use the class&#x27; id wrapped in `${}` (e.g. `${my-months}`). Speech-to-Text supports three locations: `global`, `us` (US North America), and `eu` (Europe). If you are calling the `speech.googleapis.com` endpoint, use the `global` location.

Anti-biasing is not enabled, so negative boost will simply be ignored. Though `boost` can accept a wide range of positive values, most use cases are best served with values between 0 (exclusive) and 20.

This can also be used to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See [usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/quotas#content). List items can also include pre-built or custom classes containing groups of words that represent common concepts that occur in natural language. For example, rather than providing a phrase hint for every month of the year (e.g. &quot;i was born in january&quot;, &quot;i was born in febuary&quot;, ...), use the pre-built `$MONTH` class improves the likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes months (e.g. &quot;i was born in $month&quot;). To refer to pre-built classes, use the class&#x27; symbol prepended with `$` e.g. `$MONTH`. To refer to custom classes that were defined inline in the request, set the class&#x27;s `custom_class_id` to a string unique to all class resources and inline classes. Then use the class&#x27; id wrapped in $`{...}` e.g. &quot;${my-months}&quot;. To refer to custom classes resources, use the class&#x27; id wrapped in `${}` (e.g. `${my-months}`). Speech-to-Text supports three locations: `global`, `us` (US North America), and `eu` (Europe). If you are calling the `speech.googleapis.com` endpoint, use the `global` location. To specify a region, use a [regional endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/endpoints) with matching `us` or `eu` location value.
