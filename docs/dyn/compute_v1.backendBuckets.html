<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addSignedUrlKey">addSignedUrlKey(project, backendBucket, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds a key for validating requests with signed URLs for this backend bucket.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  backendBucket: string, Name of the BackendBucket resource to which the Signed URL Key should be added. The name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a customer-supplied Signing Key used by Cloud CDN Signed URLs
  &quot;keyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the key. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  &quot;keyValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # 128-bit key value used for signing the URL. The key value must be a valid RFC 4648 Section 5 base64url encoded string.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of BackendBucket resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the logic is the same as today.

Returns:

    &quot;defaultTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;maxTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin.

Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
