<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addSignedUrlKey">addSignedUrlKey(project, backendBucket, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds a key for validating requests with signed URLs for this backend bucket.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  backendBucket: string, Name of the BackendBucket resource to which the Signed URL Key should be added. The name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a customer-supplied Signing Key used by Cloud CDN Signed URLs
  &quot;keyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the key. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  &quot;keyValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # 128-bit key value used for signing the URL. The key value must be a valid RFC 4648 Section 5 base64url encoded string.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of BackendBucket resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

Returns:

Responses without these headers will not be cached at Google&#x27;s edge, and will require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server.
            #

            #
            # CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.

With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present.

Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;.

When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s.

        # USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these headers will not be cached at Google&#x27;s edge, and will require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server.
        #
        # FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content.
        #
        # CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.
    &quot;clientTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 86400s (1 day).
    &quot;defaultTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;maxTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;negativeCaching&quot;: True or False, # Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in negative_caching_policy.
    &quot;negativeCachingPolicy&quot;: [ # Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN&#x27;s default cache TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache. Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a policy exists.
      { # Specify CDN TTLs for response error codes.
        &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The HTTP status code to define a TTL against. Only HTTP status codes 300, 301, 302, 307, 308, 404, 405, 410, 421, 451 and 501 are can be specified as values, and you cannot specify a status code more than once.
        &quot;ttl&quot;: 42, # The TTL (in seconds) for which to cache responses with the corresponding status code. The maximum allowed value is 1800s (30 minutes), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;requestCoalescing&quot;: True or False, # If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple concurrent cache fill requests into a small number of requests to the origin.
    &quot;serveWhileStale&quot;: 42, # Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered when refreshing the cache. This setting defines the default &quot;max-stale&quot; duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1 week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.
    &quot;signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a &quot;Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]&quot; header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses will not be altered.
    &quot;signedUrlKeyNames&quot;: [ # [Output Only] Names of the keys for signing request URLs.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;customResponseHeaders&quot;: [ # Headers that the HTTP/S load balancer should add to proxied responses.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An optional textual description of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
  &quot;enableCdn&quot;: True or False, # If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendBucket.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#backendBucket&quot;, # Type of the resource.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
