<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="cancel">cancel(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.  The server
makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
guaranteed.  If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
`google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.  Clients can use
Operations.GetOperation or
other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the
operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,
the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with
an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,
corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for Operations.CancelOperation.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the latest state of a long-running operation.  Clients can use this
method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API
service.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation resource. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(name, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, pageSize=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the
server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding
to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To
override the binding, API services can add a binding such as
`"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration.
For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations
collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding
is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation's parent resource. (required)
  pageToken: string, The standard list page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  pageSize: integer, The standard list page size.
  filter: string, The standard list filter.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response message for Operations.ListOperations.
    "operations": [ # A list of operations that matches the specified filter in the request.
