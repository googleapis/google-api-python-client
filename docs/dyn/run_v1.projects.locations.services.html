  <pre>Create a service.

Args:
  parent: string, The namespace in which the service should be created.
For Cloud Run (fully managed), replace {namespace_id} with the project ID
or number. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Service acts as a top-level container that manages a set of Routes and
      # Configurations which implement a network service. Service exists to provide a
      # singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and
      # which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and
      # team resource ownership. Service acts only as an orchestrator of the
      # underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a kubernetes Deployment
      # orchestrates ReplicaSets).

      # and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.

rejected.

Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.
Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
leave the field unset.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.
        #
        # Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value
        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

the Update request, Cloud Run will work to make the &#x27;status&#x27;

May provide metadata.resourceVersion to enforce update from last read for
optimistic concurrency control.

For Cloud Run (fully managed), replace {namespace_id} with the project ID
or number. (required)

    &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`. The size of

        # controls for Google Cloud resources.
        #
        #
        # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
        # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
        # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
        # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
        # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
        # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

          # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

          # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
          # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
          #
          # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
          # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
          # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
          # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
          #   that includes conditions
          #
          # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
          # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
          # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
          # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
          #
          # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
          # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which

        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
