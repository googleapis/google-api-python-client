<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a billing account.
This method can only be used to create
[billing subaccounts](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts)
by GCP resellers.
When creating a subaccount, the current authenticated user must have the
`billing.accounts.update` IAM permission on the master account, which is
typically given to billing account
[administrators](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access).
This method will return an error if the master account has not been
provisioned as a reseller account.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A billing account in [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
      # You can assign a billing account to one or more projects.
    &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The display name given to the billing account, such as `My Billing
        # Account`. This name is displayed in the GCP Console.
    &quot;masterBillingAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If this account is a
        # [subaccount](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts), then this

        # resold through.
        # Otherwise this will be empty.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the billing account. The resource name has the form
        # `billingAccounts/{billing_account_id}`. For example,
        # `billingAccounts/012345-567890-ABCDEF` would be the resource name for
        # billing account `012345-567890-ABCDEF`.
    &quot;open&quot;: True or False, # Output only. True if the billing account is open, and will therefore be charged for any
        # usage on associated projects. False if the billing account is closed, and

  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
leave the field unset.

      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Tests the access control policy for a billing account. This method takes
the resource and a set of permissions as input and returns the subset of
the input permissions that the caller is allowed for that resource.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
