<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists buckets (Beta).

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource whose buckets are to be listed:
&quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot;
&quot;organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot;
&quot;billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot;
&quot;folders/[FOLDER_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot;
Note: The locations portion of the resource must be specified, but supplying the character - in place of LOCATION_ID will return all buckets. (required)
  pageToken: string, Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to this method. pageToken must be the value of nextPageToken from the previous response. The values of other method parameters should be identical to those in the previous call.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request. Non-positive values are ignored. The presence of nextPageToken in the response indicates that more results might be available.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response from ListBuckets (Beta).
    &quot;buckets&quot;: [ # A list of buckets.
      { # Describes a repository of logs (Beta).
        &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last update timestamp of the bucket.
        &quot;retentionDays&quot;: 42, # Logs will be retained by default for this amount of time, after which they will automatically be deleted. The minimum retention period is 1 day. If this value is set to zero at bucket creation time, the default time of 30 days will be used.
        &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The creation timestamp of the bucket. This is not set for any of the default buckets.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the bucket. For example: &quot;projects/my-project-id/locations/my-location/buckets/my-bucket-id The supported locations are:  &quot;global&quot;  &quot;us-central1&quot;For the location of global it is unspecified where logs are actually stored. Once a bucket has been created, the location can not be changed.
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Describes this bucket.
        &quot;lifecycleState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The bucket lifecycle state.
      },
    ],
    &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If there might be more results than appear in this response, then nextPageToken is included. To get the next set of results, call the same method again using the value of nextPageToken as pageToken.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>
