  filter: string, Optional. An expression for filtering the results of the ListDataScanJobs request.If unspecified, all datascan jobs will be returned. Multiple filters can be applied (with AND, OR logical operators). Filters are case-sensitive.Allowed fields are: start_time end_timestart_time and end_time expect RFC-3339 formatted strings (e.g. 2018-10-08T18:30:00-07:00).For instance, &#x27;start_time &gt; 2018-10-08T00:00:00.123456789Z AND end_time &lt; 2018-10-09T00:00:00.123456789Z&#x27; limits results to DataScanJobs between specified start and end times.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. Maximum number of DataScanJobs to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 10 DataScanJobs will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.
