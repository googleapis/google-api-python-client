  definitionsOnly: boolean, Examine only the specified campaign or advertiser's event tags for matching selector criteria. When set to false, the parent advertiser and parent campaign of the specified ad or campaign is examined as well. In addition, when set to false, the status field is examined as well, along with the enabledByDefault field. This parameter can not be set to true when adId is specified as ads do not define their own even tags.
  eventTagTypes: string, Select only event tags with the specified event tag types. Event tag types can be used to specify whether to use a third-party pixel, a third-party JavaScript URL, or a third-party click-through URL for either impression or click tracking. (repeated)

For example, "eventtag*2015" will return objects with names like "eventtag June 2015", "eventtag April 2015", or simply "eventtag 2015". Most of the searches also add wildcards implicitly at the start and the end of the search string. For example, a search string of "eventtag" will match objects with name "my eventtag", "eventtag 2015", or simply "eventtag".
  sortField: string, Field by which to sort the list.
    Allowed values
      ID - 
      NAME - 
  enabled: boolean, Select only enabled event tags. What is considered enabled or disabled depends on the definitionsOnly parameter. When definitionsOnly is set to true, only the specified advertiser or campaign's event tags' enabledByDefault field is examined. When definitionsOnly is set to false, the specified ad or specified campaign's parent advertiser's or parent campaign's event tags' enabledByDefault and status fields are examined as well.
