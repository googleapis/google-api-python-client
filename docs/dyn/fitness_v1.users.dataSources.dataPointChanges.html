<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(userId, dataSourceId, limit=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Queries for user&#x27;s data point changes for a particular data source.

Args:
  userId: string, List data points for the person identified. Use &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; to indicate
the authenticated user. Only &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; is supported at this time. (required)
  dataSourceId: string, The data stream ID of the data source that created the dataset. (required)
  limit: integer, If specified, no more than this many data point changes will be included
in the response.
  pageToken: string, The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets.
To get the next page of results, set this parameter to the value of
&lt;code&gt;nextPageToken&lt;/code&gt; from the previous response.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
