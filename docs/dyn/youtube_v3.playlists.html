<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(part, body=None, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates an existing resource.

Args:
  part: string, The *part* parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include. Note that this method will override the existing values for mutable properties that are contained in any parts that the request body specifies. For example, a playlist&#x27;s description is contained in the snippet part, which must be included in the request body. If the request does not specify a value for the snippet.description property, the playlist&#x27;s existing description will be deleted. (required) (repeated)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
