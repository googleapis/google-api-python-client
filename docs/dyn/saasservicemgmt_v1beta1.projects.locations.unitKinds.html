  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was last updated. Any change to the resource made by users must refresh this value. Changes to a resource made by the service should refresh this value.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  unitKindId: string, Required. The ID value for the new unit kind.
  validateOnly: boolean, If &quot;validate_only&quot; is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, etag=None, requestId=None, validateOnly=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Delete a single unit kind.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the resource within a service. (required)
  etag: string, The etag known to the client for the expected state of the unit kind. This is used with state-changing methods to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in parallel on the same resource. An etag wildcard provide optimistic concurrency based on the expected existence of the unit kind. The Any wildcard (`*`) requires that the resource must already exists, and the Not Any wildcard (`!*`) requires that it must not.
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, If &quot;validate_only&quot; is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the UnitKind resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields in the UnitKind will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, If &quot;validate_only&quot; is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
