<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource. A `NOT_FOUND` error
is returned if the resource does not exist. An empty policy is returned
if the resource exists but does not have a policy set on it.

Supported resources are:
  - Tag templates.
  - Entries.
  - Entry groups.
Note, this method cannot be used to manage policies for BigQuery, Pub/Sub
and any external Google Cloud Platform resources synced to Data Catalog.

Callers must have following Google IAM permission
  - `datacatalog.tagTemplates.getIamPolicy` to get policies on tag
    templates.
  - `datacatalog.entries.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entries.
  - `datacatalog.entryGroups.getIamPolicy` to get policies on entry groups.

  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

          #
          # Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.
          # Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
          # leave the field unset.
          #

        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the caller&#x27;s permissions on a resource.
If the resource does not exist, an empty set of permissions is returned
(We don&#x27;t return a `NOT_FOUND` error).

Supported resources are:
  - Tag templates.
  - Entries.
  - Entry groups.
Note, this method cannot be used to manage policies for BigQuery, Pub/Sub
and any external Google Cloud Platform resources synced to Data Catalog.

A caller is not required to have Google IAM permission to make this
request.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more

    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
