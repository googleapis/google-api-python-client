  <pre>Lists anomalies in any of the datasets.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent app for which anomalies were detected. Format: apps/{app} (required)
  filter: string, Filtering criteria for anomalies. For basic filter guidance, please check: https://google.aip.dev/160. **Supported functions:** * `activeBetween(startTime, endTime)`: If specified, only list anomalies that were active in between `startTime` (inclusive) and `endTime` (exclusive). Both parameters are expected to conform to an RFC-3339 formatted string (e.g. `2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00`). UTC offsets are supported. Both `startTime` and `endTime` accept the special value `UNBOUNDED`, to signify intervals with no lower or upper bound, respectively. Examples: * `activeBetween(&quot;2021-04-21T11:30:00Z&quot;, &quot;2021-07-21T00:00:00Z&quot;)` * `activeBetween(UNBOUNDED, &quot;2021-11-21T00:00:00-04:00&quot;)` * `activeBetween(&quot;2021-07-21T00:00:00-04:00&quot;, UNBOUNDED)`
  pageSize: integer, Maximum size of the returned data. If unspecified, at most 10 anomalies will be returned. The maximum value is 100; values above 100 will be coerced to 100.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListErrorReports` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListErrorReports` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response with a list of anomalies in datasets.
  &quot;anomalies&quot;: [ # Anomalies that were found.
    { # Represents an anomaly detected in a dataset. Our anomaly detection systems flag datapoints in a time series that fall outside of and expected range derived from historical data. Although those expected ranges have an upper and a lower bound, we only flag anomalies when the data has become unexpectedly _worse_, which usually corresponds to the case where the metric crosses the upper bound. Multiple contiguous datapoints in a timeline outside of the expected range will be grouped into a single anomaly. Therefore, an anomaly represents effectively a segment of a metric&#x27;s timeline. The information stored in the `timeline_spec`, `dimensions` and `metric` can be used to fetch a full timeline with extended ragne for context. **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app.
      &quot;dimensions&quot;: [ # Combination of dimensions in which the anomaly was detected.
        { # Represents the value of a single dimension.
          &quot;dimension&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the dimension.
          &quot;int64Value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Actual value, represented as an int64.
          &quot;stringValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Actual value, represented as a string.
          &quot;valueLabel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Human-friendly label for the value, always in English. For example, &#x27;Spain&#x27; for the &#x27;ES&#x27; country code. Whereas the dimension value is stable, this value label is subject to change. Do not assume that the (value, value_label) relationship is stable. For example, the ISO country code &#x27;MK&#x27; changed its name recently to &#x27;North Macedonia&#x27;.
        },
      ],
      &quot;metric&quot;: { # Represents the value of a metric. # Metric where the anomaly was detected, together with the anomalous value.
        &quot;decimalValue&quot;: { # A representation of a decimal value, such as 2.5. Clients may convert values into language-native decimal formats, such as Java&#x27;s BigDecimal or Python&#x27;s decimal.Decimal. [BigDecimal]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html [decimal.Decimal]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html # Actual value, represented as a decimal number.
          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (&quot;the integer&quot;), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty string **should** be interpreted as `0`. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -&gt; `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -&gt; `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case, with explicit sign (`2.5e8` -&gt; `2.5E+8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5E0` -&gt; `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5E-1` &lt;-&gt; `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = &#x27;&#x27; | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = &#x27;+&#x27; | &#x27;-&#x27;; Significand = Digits &#x27;.&#x27; | [Digits] &#x27;.&#x27; Digits; Exponent = (&#x27;e&#x27; | &#x27;E&#x27;) [Sign] Digits; Digits = { &#x27;0&#x27; | &#x27;1&#x27; | &#x27;2&#x27; | &#x27;3&#x27; | &#x27;4&#x27; | &#x27;5&#x27; | &#x27;6&#x27; | &#x27;7&#x27; | &#x27;8&#x27; | &#x27;9&#x27; }; Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range.

Timelines have an aggregation period (`DAILY`, `HOURLY`, etc) which defines how events are aggregated in metrics. The points in a timeline are defined by the starting DateTime of the aggregation period. The duration is implicit in the AggregationPeriod. Hourly aggregation periods, when supported by a metric set, are always specified in UTC to avoid ambiguities around daylight saving time transitions, where an hour is skipped when adopting DST, and repeated when abandoning DST. For example, the timestamp &#x27;2021-11-07 01:00:00 America/Los_Angeles&#x27; is ambiguous since it can correspond to &#x27;2021-11-07 08:00:00 UTC&#x27; or &#x27;2021-11-07 09:00:00 UTC&#x27;. Daily aggregation periods require specifying a timezone which will determine the precise instants of the start and the end of the day. Not all metric sets support all timezones, so make sure to check which timezones are supported by the metric set you want to query. # Timeline specification that covers the anomaly period.

The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year, month, or day respectively.
