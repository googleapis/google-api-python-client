<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="startPaidService">startPaidService(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts paid service for a trial entitlement. Starts paid service for a trial entitlement immediately. This method is only applicable if a plan is set up for a trial entitlement but has some trial days remaining. Possible error codes: * PERMISSION_DENIED: The customer doesn&#x27;t belong to the reseller. * INVALID_ARGUMENT: Required request parameters are missing or invalid. * NOT_FOUND: Entitlement resource not found. * FAILED_PRECONDITION/NOT_IN_TRIAL: This method only works for entitlement on trial plans. * INTERNAL: Any non-user error related to a technical issue in the backend. Contact Cloud Channel support. * UNKNOWN: Any non-user error related to a technical issue in the backend. Contact Cloud Channel support. Return value: The ID of a long-running operation. To get the results of the operation, call the GetOperation method of CloudChannelOperationsService. The Operation metadata will contain an instance of OperationMetadata.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the entitlement to start a paid service for. Name uses the format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id}/entitlements/{entitlement_id} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CloudChannelService.StartPaidService.
  &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. You can specify an optional unique request ID, and if you need to retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it&#x27;s complete. For example, you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if it received the original operation with the same request ID. If it did, it will ignore the second request. The request ID must be a valid [UUID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`).
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="suspend">suspend(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Suspends a previously fulfilled entitlement. An entitlement suspension is a long-running operation. Possible error codes: * PERMISSION_DENIED: The customer doesn&#x27;t belong to the reseller. * INVALID_ARGUMENT: Required request parameters are missing or invalid. * NOT_FOUND: Entitlement resource not found. * NOT_ACTIVE: Entitlement is not active. * INTERNAL: Any non-user error related to a technical issue in the backend.

To get the results of the operation, call the GetOperation method of CloudChannelOperationsService. The Operation metadata will contain an instance of OperationMetadata.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the entitlement to suspend. Name uses the format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id}/entitlements/{entitlement_id} (required)

    The object takes the form of:
