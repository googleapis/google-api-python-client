<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getPolicy">getPolicy(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>A policy specifies the attestors that must attest to
a container image, before the project is allowed to deploy that
image. There is at most one policy per project. All image admission
requests are permitted if a project has no policy.

Gets the policy for this project. Returns a default
policy if the project does not have one.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the policy to retrieve,
in the format `projects/*/policy`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
