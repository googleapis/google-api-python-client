Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project on which to execute the request. The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER] The [PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER] must match the dashboard resource name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Google Stackdriver dashboard. Dashboards define the content and layout of pages in the Stackdriver web application.
  &quot;columnLayout&quot;: { # A simplified layout that divides the available space into vertical columns and arranges a set of widgets vertically in each column. # The content is divided into equally spaced columns and the widgets are arranged vertically.
    &quot;columns&quot;: [ # The columns of content to display.
      { # Defines the layout properties and content for a column.
        &quot;weight&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The relative weight of this column. The column weight is used to adjust the width of columns on the screen (relative to peers). Greater the weight, greater the width of the column on the screen. If omitted, a value of 1 is used while rendering.
        &quot;widgets&quot;: [ # The display widgets arranged vertically in this column.
          { # Widget contains a single dashboard component and configuration of how to present the component in the dashboard.
            &quot;blank&quot;: { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for Empty is empty JSON object {}. # A blank space.
            },
            &quot;scorecard&quot;: { # A widget showing the latest value of a metric, and how this value relates to one or more thresholds. # A scorecard summarizing time series data.
              &quot;gaugeView&quot;: { # A gauge chart shows where the current value sits within a pre-defined range. The upper and lower bounds should define the possible range of values for the scorecard&#x27;s query (inclusive). # Will cause the scorecard to show a gauge chart.

                &quot;upperBound&quot;: 3.14, # The upper bound for this gauge chart. The value of the chart should always be less than or equal to this.

                &quot;sparkChartType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The type of sparkchart to show in this chartView.
              },
              &quot;thresholds&quot;: [ # The thresholds used to determine the state of the scorecard given the time series&#x27; current value. For an actual value x, the scorecard is in a danger state if x is less than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers below, or greater than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers above. Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds: { value: 90, category: &#x27;DANGER&#x27;, trigger: &#x27;ABOVE&#x27;, }, { value: 70, category: &#x27;WARNING&#x27;, trigger: &#x27;ABOVE&#x27;, }, { value: 10, category: &#x27;DANGER&#x27;, trigger: &#x27;BELOW&#x27;, }, { value: 20, category: &#x27;WARNING&#x27;, trigger: &#x27;BELOW&#x27;, }Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to 90 a DANGER state.

This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example &quot;the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster&quot;.
