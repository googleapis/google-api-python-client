  <pre>Creates a flow in the specified agent.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The agent to create a flow for. Format: `projects//locations//agents/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Flows represents the conversation flows when you build your chatbot agent. A flow consists of many pages connected by the transition routes. Conversations always start with the built-in Start Flow (with an all-0 ID). Transition routes can direct the conversation session from the current flow (parent flow) to another flow (sub flow). When the sub flow is finished, Dialogflow will bring the session back to the parent flow, where the sub flow is started. Usually, when a transition route is followed by a matched intent, the intent will be &quot;consumed&quot;. This means the intent won&#x27;t activate more transition routes. However, when the followed transition route moves the conversation session into a different flow, the matched intent can be carried over and to be consumed in the target flow.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The description of the flow. The maximum length is 500 characters. If exceeded, the request is rejected.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human-readable name of the flow.
  &quot;eventHandlers&quot;: [ # A flow&#x27;s event handlers serve two purposes: * They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow. * They are inherited by every page&#x27;s event handlers, which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow. Unlike transition_routes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.
    { # An event handler specifies an event that can be handled during a session. When the specified event happens, the following actions are taken in order: * If there is a `trigger_fulfillment` associated with the event, it will be called. * If there is a `target_page` associated with the event, the session will transition into the specified page. * If there is a `target_flow` associated with the event, the session will transition into the specified flow.
      &quot;event&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the event to handle.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of this event handler.
      &quot;targetFlow&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The target flow to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows/`.
      &quot;targetPage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The target page to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows//pages/`.
      &quot;triggerFulfillment&quot;: { # A fulfillment can do one or more of the following actions at the same time: * Generate rich message responses. * Set parameter values. * Call the webhook. Fulfillments can be called at various stages in the Page or Form lifecycle. For example, when a DetectIntentRequest drives a session to enter a new page, the page&#x27;s entry fulfillment can add a static response to the QueryResult in the returning DetectIntentResponse, call the webhook (for example, to load user data from a database), or both. # The fulfillment to call when the event occurs. Handling webhook errors with a fulfillment enabled with webhook could cause infinite loop. It is invalid to specify such fulfillment for a handler handling webhooks.
        &quot;conditionalCases&quot;: [ # Conditional cases for this fulfillment.
          { # A list of cascading if-else conditions. Cases are mutually exclusive. The first one with a matching condition is selected, all the rest ignored.
            &quot;cases&quot;: [ # A list of cascading if-else conditions.
              { # Each case has a Boolean condition. When it is evaluated to be True, the corresponding messages will be selected and evaluated recursively.
                &quot;caseContent&quot;: [ # A list of case content.
                  { # The list of messages or conditional cases to activate for this case.
                    &quot;additionalCases&quot;: # Object with schema name: GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3beta1FulfillmentConditionalCases # Additional cases to be evaluated.
                    &quot;message&quot;: { # Represents a response message that can be returned by a conversational agent. Response messages are also used for output audio synthesis. The approach is as follows: * If at least one OutputAudioText response is present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated as either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. * Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. This approach allows for more sophisticated user experience scenarios, where the text displayed to the user may differ from what is heard. # Returned message.
                      &quot;conversationSuccess&quot;: { # Indicates that the conversation succeeded, i.e., the bot handled the issue that the customer talked to it about. Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn&#x27;t process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don&#x27;t return ConversationSuccess. You may set this, for example: * In the entry_fulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded. * In a webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer issue. # Indicates that the conversation succeeded.

    { # Flows represents the conversation flows when you build your chatbot agent. A flow consists of many pages connected by the transition routes. Conversations always start with the built-in Start Flow (with an all-0 ID). Transition routes can direct the conversation session from the current flow (parent flow) to another flow (sub flow). When the sub flow is finished, Dialogflow will bring the session back to the parent flow, where the sub flow is started. Usually, when a transition route is followed by a matched intent, the intent will be &quot;consumed&quot;. This means the intent won&#x27;t activate more transition routes. However, when the followed transition route moves the conversation session into a different flow, the matched intent can be carried over and to be consumed in the target flow.

Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow. Unlike transition_routes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.

    { # Flows represents the conversation flows when you build your chatbot agent. A flow consists of many pages connected by the transition routes. Conversations always start with the built-in Start Flow (with an all-0 ID). Transition routes can direct the conversation session from the current flow (parent flow) to another flow (sub flow). When the sub flow is finished, Dialogflow will bring the session back to the parent flow, where the sub flow is started. Usually, when a transition route is followed by a matched intent, the intent will be &quot;consumed&quot;. This means the intent won&#x27;t activate more transition routes. However, when the followed transition route moves the conversation session into a different flow, the matched intent can be carried over and to be consumed in the target flow.

Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow. Unlike transition_routes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.
    { # An event handler specifies an event that can be handled during a session. When the specified event happens, the following actions are taken in order: * If there is a `trigger_fulfillment` associated with the event, it will be called. * If there is a `target_page` associated with the event, the session will transition into the specified page. * If there is a `target_flow` associated with the event, the session will transition into the specified flow.

Fulfillments can be called at various stages in the Page or Form lifecycle. For example, when a DetectIntentRequest drives a session to enter a new page, the page&#x27;s entry fulfillment can add a static response to the QueryResult in the returning DetectIntentResponse, call the webhook (for example, to load user data from a database), or both. # The fulfillment to call when the event occurs.
