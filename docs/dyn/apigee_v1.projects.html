  <pre>Provisions a new Apigee organization with a functioning runtime. This is the standard way to create trial organizations for a free Apigee trial.

Args:
  project: string, Required. Name of the GCP project with which to associate the Apigee organization. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for ProvisionOrganization.
  &quot;analyticsRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Primary Cloud Platform region for analytics data storage. For valid values, see [Create an organization](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/latest/precog-provision). Defaults to `us-west1`.
  &quot;authorizedNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Compute Engine network used for Service Networking to be peered with Apigee runtime instances. See [Getting started with the Service Networking API](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-networking/getting-started). Apigee also supports shared VPC (that is, the host network project is not the same as the one that is peering with Apigee). See [Shared VPC overview](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc). To use a shared VPC network, use the following format: `projects/{host-project-id}/{region}/networks/{network-name}`. For example: `projects/my-sharedvpc-host/global/networks/mynetwork`
  &quot;disableVpcPeering&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Flag that specifies whether the VPC Peering through Private Google Access should be disabled between the consumer network and Apigee. Required if an authorizedNetwork on the consumer project is not provided, in which case the flag should be set to true. The value must be set before the creation of any Apigee runtime instance and can be updated only when there are no runtime instances. **Note:** Apigee will be deprecating the vpc peering model that requires you to provide &#x27;authorizedNetwork&#x27;, by making the non-peering model as the default way of provisioning Apigee organization in future. So, this will be a temporary flag to enable the transition. Not supported for Apigee hybrid.
  &quot;runtimeLocation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Cloud Platform location for the runtime instance. Defaults to zone `us-west1-a`. If a region is provided, `EVAL` organizations will use the region for automatically selecting a zone for the runtime instance.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
}</pre>
