  <pre>Reschedule maintenance for a given instance in a given project and location.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Redis instance resource name using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}` where `location_id` refers to a GCP region. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for RescheduleMaintenance.
  &quot;rescheduleType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. If reschedule type is SPECIFIC_TIME, must set up schedule_time as well.
  &quot;scheduleTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Timestamp when the maintenance shall be rescheduled to if reschedule_type=SPECIFIC_TIME, in RFC 3339 format, for example `2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z`.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

Operations that have successfully been cancelled have Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`. `apiVersion`: API version used to start the operation. }
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
