<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="run">run(projectId, triggerId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Runs a `BuildTrigger` at a particular source revision.

Args:
  projectId: string, Required. ID of the project. (required)
  triggerId: string, Required. ID of the trigger. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Location of the source in a Google Cloud Source Repository.
  &quot;invertRegex&quot;: True or False, # Only trigger a build if the revision regex does NOT match the revision regex.
  &quot;tagName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Regex matching tags to build. The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the syntax accepted by RE2 and described at https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax
  &quot;commitSha&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Explicit commit SHA to build.
  &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # ID of the project that owns the Cloud Source Repository. If omitted, the project ID requesting the build is assumed.
  &quot;substitutions&quot;: { # Substitutions to use in a triggered build. Should only be used with RunBuildTrigger
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;repoName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Name of the Cloud Source Repository.
  &quot;branchName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Regex matching branches to build. The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the syntax accepted by RE2 and described at https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax
  &quot;dir&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Directory, relative to the source root, in which to run the build. This must be a relative path. If a step&#x27;s `dir` is specified and is an absolute path, this value is ignored for that step&#x27;s execution.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
    &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
    &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
      &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {
          &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
      &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
    &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
