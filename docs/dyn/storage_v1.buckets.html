Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold&#x27;s release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.

One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that.

One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold&#x27;s release.

One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that.

One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.
