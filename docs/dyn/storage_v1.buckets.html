<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(bucket, ifMetagenerationMatch=None, userProject=None, ifMetagenerationNotMatch=None)</code>
  <pre>Permanently deletes an empty bucket.

Args:
  bucket: string, Name of a bucket. (required)
  ifMetagenerationMatch: string, If set, only deletes the bucket if its metageneration matches this value.
  userProject: string, The project number to be billed for this request, for Requester Pays buckets.
  ifMetagenerationNotMatch: string, If set, only deletes the bucket if its metageneration does not match this value.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(bucket, projection=None, ifMetagenerationMatch=None, userProject=None, ifMetagenerationNotMatch=None)</code>

Args:
  bucket: string, Name of a bucket. (required)
  projection: string, Set of properties to return. Defaults to noAcl.
    Allowed values
      full - Include all properties.
      noAcl - Omit owner, acl and defaultObjectAcl properties.
  ifMetagenerationMatch: string, Makes the return of the bucket metadata conditional on whether the bucket's current metageneration matches the given value.
  userProject: string, The project number to be billed for this request, for Requester Pays buckets.
  ifMetagenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the return of the bucket metadata conditional on whether the bucket's current metageneration does not match the given value.
