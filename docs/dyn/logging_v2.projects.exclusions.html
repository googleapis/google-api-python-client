  <pre>Creates a new exclusion in the _Default sink in a specified parent resource. Only log entries belonging to that resource can be excluded. You can have up to 10 exclusions in a resource.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource in which to create the exclusion: &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]&quot; &quot;organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]&quot; &quot;billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]&quot; &quot;folders/[FOLDER_ID]&quot; For examples:&quot;projects/my-logging-project&quot; &quot;organizations/123456789&quot; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Specifies a set of log entries that are filtered out by a sink. If your Google Cloud resource receives a large volume of log entries, you can use exclusions to reduce your chargeable logs. Note that exclusions on organization-level and folder-level sinks don&#x27;t apply to child resources. Note also that you cannot modify the _Required sink or exclude logs from it.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The creation timestamp of the exclusion.This field may not be present for older exclusions.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of this exclusion.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A client-assigned identifier, such as &quot;load-balancer-exclusion&quot;. Identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods. First character has to be alphanumeric.
