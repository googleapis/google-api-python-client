  <pre>Creates a `CustomDomain`.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The custom domain&#x27;s parent, specifically a Firebase Hosting `Site`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A `CustomDomain` is an entity that links a domain name to a Firebase Hosting site. Add a `CustomDomain` to your site to allow Hosting to serve the site&#x27;s content in response to requests against your domain name.
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Annotations you can add to leave both human- and machine-readable metadata about your `CustomDomain`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;cert&quot;: { # An SSL certificate used to provide end-to-end encryption for requests against your domain name. A `Certificate` can be an actual SSL certificate or, for newly-created custom domains, Hosting&#x27;s intent to create one. # Output only. The SSL certificate Hosting has for this custom domain&#x27;s domain name. For new custom domains, this often represents Hosting&#x27;s intent to create a certificate, rather than an actual cert. Check the `state` field for more.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The certificate&#x27;s creation time. For `TEMPORARY` certs this is the time Hosting first generated challenges for your domain name. For all other cert types, it&#x27;s the time the actual cert was created.
    &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The certificate&#x27;s expiration time. After this time, the cert can no longer be used to provide secure communication between Hosting and your site&#x27;s visitors.
    &quot;issues&quot;: [ # Output only. A set of errors Hosting encountered when attempting to create a cert for your domain name. Resolve these issues to ensure Hosting is able to provide secure communication with your site&#x27;s visitors.
      { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc).

    ],
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the certificate. Only the `CERT_ACTIVE` and `CERT_EXPIRING_SOON` states provide SSL coverage for a domain name. If the state is `PROPAGATING` and Hosting had an active cert for the domain name before, that formerly-active cert provides SSL coverage for the domain name until the current cert propagates.
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The certificate&#x27;s type.
    &quot;verification&quot;: { # A set of ACME challenges you can use to allow Hosting to create an SSL certificate for your domain name before directing traffic to Hosting servers. Use either the DNS or HTTP challenge; it&#x27;s not necessary to provide both. # Output only. A set of ACME challenges you can add to your DNS records or existing, non-Hosting hosting provider to allow Hosting to create an SSL certificate for your domain name before you point traffic toward hosting. You can use thse challenges as part of a zero downtime transition from your old provider to Hosting.

These updates present the current state of your domain name&#x27;s DNS records when Hosting last queried them, and the desired set of records that Hosting needs to see before your custom domain can be fully active. # Output only. A `TXT` record to add to your DNS records that confirms your intent to let Hosting create an SSL cert for your domain name.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, showDeleted=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists each `CustomDomain` associated with the specified parent Hosting site. Returns `CustomDomain`s in a consistent, but undefined, order to facilitate pagination.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The Firebase Hosting `Site` with `CustomDomain` entities you&#x27;d like to list. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The max number of `CustomDomain` entities to return in a request. Defaults to 10.
  pageToken: string, A token from a previous call to `ListCustomDomains` that tells the server where to resume listing.
  showDeleted: boolean, If true, the request returns soft-deleted `CustomDomain`s that haven&#x27;t been fully-deleted yet. To restore deleted `CustomDomain`s, make an `UndeleteCustomDomain` request.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
