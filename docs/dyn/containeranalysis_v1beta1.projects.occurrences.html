<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a note or an occurrence resource.
Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or
`containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is
a note or occurrence, respectively.

The resource takes the format `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notes/[NOTE_ID]` for
notes and `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]` for
occurrences.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.
    "options": { # Encapsulates settings provided to GetIamPolicy. # OPTIONAL: A `GetPolicyOptions` object for specifying options to
        # `GetIamPolicy`.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

              # provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified note or occurrence.
Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or
`containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is
a note or an occurrence, respectively.

The resource takes the format `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notes/[NOTE_ID]` for
notes and `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]` for
occurrences.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

        # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
