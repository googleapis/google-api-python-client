                    # a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any
                    # of the following circumstances:
                    #   * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier.
                    #   * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the
                    #     signature with respect to the payload.
                    #

                    # included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any
                    # "attached" payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly
                    # provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds
                    # this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that

                      #   * When possible, the `public_key_id` SHOULD be an immutable reference,
                      #     such as a cryptographic digest.

  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified note or occurrence.
Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or
`containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is
a note or an occurrence, respectively.

The resource takes the format `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notes/[NOTE_ID]` for
notes and `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]` for
occurrences.

  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the permissions that a caller has on the specified note or
occurrence. Requires list permission on the project (for example,
`containeranalysis.notes.list`).

The resource takes the format `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notes/[NOTE_ID]` for
notes and `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]` for
occurrences.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
