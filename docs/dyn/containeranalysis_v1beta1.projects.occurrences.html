<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchCreate">batchCreate(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates new occurrences in batch.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project in the form of `projects/[PROJECT_ID]`, under which the occurrences are to be created. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to create occurrences in batch.
  &quot;occurrences&quot;: [ # Required. The occurrences to create. Max allowed length is 1000.
    { # An instance of an analysis type that has been found on a resource.
      &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Details of an attestation occurrence. # Describes an attestation of an artifact.
        &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the authority to which this attestation is attached is primarily useful for look-up (how to find this attestation if you already know the authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (which authority was this attestation intended to sign for). # Required. Attestation for the resource.
          &quot;genericSignedAttestation&quot;: { # An attestation wrapper that uses the Grafeas `Signature` message. This attestation must define the `serialized_payload` that the `signatures` verify and any metadata necessary to interpret that plaintext. The signatures should always be over the `serialized_payload` bytestring.
            &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Type (for example schema) of the attestation payload that was signed. The verifier must ensure that the provided type is one that the verifier supports, and that the attestation payload is a valid instantiation of that type (for example by validating a JSON schema).
            &quot;serializedPayload&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The serialized payload that is verified by one or more `signatures`. The encoding and semantic meaning of this payload must match what is set in `content_type`.
            &quot;signatures&quot;: [ # One or more signatures over `serialized_payload`. Verifier implementations should consider this attestation message verified if at least one `signature` verifies `serialized_payload`. See `Signature` in common.proto for more details on signature structure and verification.
              { # Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy). Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be &quot;attached&quot; (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any &quot;attached&quot; payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).
                &quot;publicKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The identifier for the public key that verifies this signature. * The `public_key_id` is required. * The `public_key_id` SHOULD be an RFC3986 conformant URI. * When possible, the `public_key_id` SHOULD be an immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest. Examples of valid `public_key_id`s: OpenPGP V4 public key fingerprint: * &quot;openpgp4fpr:74FAF3B861BDA0870C7B6DEF607E48D2A663AEEA&quot; See https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/openpgp4fpr for more details on this scheme. RFC6920 digest-named SubjectPublicKeyInfo (digest of the DER serialization): * &quot;ni:///sha-256;cD9o9Cq6LG3jD0iKXqEi_vdjJGecm_iXkbqVoScViaU&quot; * &quot;nih:///sha-256;703f68f42aba2c6de30f488a5ea122fef76324679c9bf89791ba95a1271589a5&quot;
                &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The content of the signature, an opaque bytestring. The payload that this signature verifies MUST be unambiguously provided with the Signature during verification. A wrapper message might provide the payload explicitly. Alternatively, a message might have a canonical serialization that can always be unambiguously computed to derive the payload.
              },
            ],
          },
          &quot;pgpSignedAttestation&quot;: { # An attestation wrapper with a PGP-compatible signature. This message only supports `ATTACHED` signatures, where the payload that is signed is included alongside the signature itself in the same file. # A PGP signed attestation.
            &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Type (for example schema) of the attestation payload that was signed. The verifier must ensure that the provided type is one that the verifier supports, and that the attestation payload is a valid instantiation of that type (for example by validating a JSON schema).
            &quot;pgpKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The cryptographic fingerprint of the key used to generate the signature, as output by, e.g. `gpg --list-keys`. This should be the version 4, full 160-bit fingerprint, expressed as a 40 character hexidecimal string. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-12.2 for details. Implementations may choose to acknowledge &quot;LONG&quot;, &quot;SHORT&quot;, or other abbreviated key IDs, but only the full fingerprint is guaranteed to work. In gpg, the full fingerprint can be retrieved from the `fpr` field returned when calling --list-keys with --with-colons. For example: ``` gpg --with-colons --with-fingerprint --force-v4-certs \ --list-keys attester@example.com tru::1:1513631572:0:3:1:5 pub:...... fpr:::::::::24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB: ``` Above, the fingerprint is `24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB`.
            &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The raw content of the signature, as output by GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) or equivalent. Since this message only supports attached signatures, the payload that was signed must be attached. While the signature format supported is dependent on the verification implementation, currently only ASCII-armored (`--armor` to gpg), non-clearsigned (`--sign` rather than `--clearsign` to gpg) are supported. Concretely, `gpg --sign --armor --output=signature.gpg payload.json` will create the signature content expected in this field in `signature.gpg` for the `payload.json` attestation payload.

{ # An instance of an analysis type that has been found on a resource.
  &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Details of an attestation occurrence. # Describes an attestation of an artifact.
    &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the authority to which this attestation is attached is primarily useful for look-up (how to find this attestation if you already know the authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (which authority was this attestation intended to sign for). # Required. Attestation for the resource.
      &quot;genericSignedAttestation&quot;: { # An attestation wrapper that uses the Grafeas `Signature` message. This attestation must define the `serialized_payload` that the `signatures` verify and any metadata necessary to interpret that plaintext. The signatures should always be over the `serialized_payload` bytestring.

Verifier implementations should consider this attestation message verified if at least one `signature` verifies `serialized_payload`. See `Signature` in common.proto for more details on signature structure and verification.
          { # Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy). Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be &quot;attached&quot; (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any &quot;attached&quot; payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).
            &quot;publicKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The identifier for the public key that verifies this signature. * The `public_key_id` is required. * The `public_key_id` SHOULD be an RFC3986 conformant URI. * When possible, the `public_key_id` SHOULD be an immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest. Examples of valid `public_key_id`s: OpenPGP V4 public key fingerprint: * &quot;openpgp4fpr:74FAF3B861BDA0870C7B6DEF607E48D2A663AEEA&quot; See https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/openpgp4fpr for more details on this scheme.

Implementations may choose to acknowledge &quot;LONG&quot;, &quot;SHORT&quot;, or other abbreviated key IDs, but only the full fingerprint is guaranteed to work. In gpg, the full fingerprint can be retrieved from the `fpr` field returned when calling --list-keys with --with-colons.

        &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The raw content of the signature, as output by GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) or equivalent. Since this message only supports attached signatures, the payload that was signed must be attached. While the signature format supported is dependent on the verification implementation, currently only ASCII-armored (`--armor` to gpg), non-clearsigned (`--sign` rather than `--clearsign` to gpg) are supported. Concretely, `gpg --sign --armor --output=signature.gpg payload.json` will create the signature content expected in this field in `signature.gpg` for the `payload.json` attestation payload.

In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint.

The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be &quot;attached&quot; (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes).

Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be &quot;attached&quot; (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any &quot;attached&quot; payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

    &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the authority to which this attestation is attached is primarily useful for look-up (how to find this attestation if you already know the authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (which authority was this attestation intended to sign for). # Required. Attestation for the resource.
      &quot;genericSignedAttestation&quot;: { # An attestation wrapper that uses the Grafeas `Signature` message. This attestation must define the `serialized_payload` that the `signatures` verify and any metadata necessary to interpret that plaintext.

Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be &quot;attached&quot; (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any &quot;attached&quot; payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).
            &quot;publicKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The identifier for the public key that verifies this signature. * The `public_key_id` is required. * The `public_key_id` SHOULD be an RFC3986 conformant URI. * When possible, the `public_key_id` SHOULD be an immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest.

        &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The raw content of the signature, as output by GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) or equivalent. Since this message only supports attached signatures, the payload that was signed must be attached. While the signature format supported is dependent on the verification implementation, currently only ASCII-armored (`--armor` to gpg), non-clearsigned (`--sign` rather than `--clearsign` to gpg) are supported. Concretely, `gpg --sign --armor --output=signature.gpg payload.json` will create the signature content expected in this field in `signature.gpg` for the `payload.json` attestation payload.

In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint.

The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be &quot;attached&quot; (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes).

  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified note or occurrence. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a note or an occurrence, respectively. The resource takes the format `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notes/[NOTE_ID]` for notes and `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]` for occurrences.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.
