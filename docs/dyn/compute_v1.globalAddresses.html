<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(project, address, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the specified address resource.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  address: string, Name of the address resource to delete. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of global addresses.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Contains a list of addresses.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

They can only be assigned to global forwarding rules for HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, or TCP Proxy load balancers in Premium Tier. For more information, read Global resources.

          "status": "A String", # [Output Only] The status of the address, which can be one of RESERVING, RESERVED, or IN_USE. An address that is RESERVING is currently in the process of being reserved. A RESERVED address is currently reserved and available to use. An IN_USE address is currently being used by another resource and is not available.

Global forwarding rules can only be Premium Tier. Regional forwarding rules can be either Premium or Standard Tier. Standard Tier addresses applied to regional forwarding rules can be used with any external load balancer. Regional forwarding rules in Premium Tier can only be used with a network load balancer.

              # If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.

          "region": "A String", # [Output Only] The URL of the region where the regional address resides. This field is not applicable to global addresses. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL.
          "ipVersion": "A String", # The IP version that will be used by this address. Valid options are IPV4 or IPV6. This can only be specified for a global address.

          "purpose": "A String", # The purpose of this resource, which can be one of the following values:
              # - `GCE_ENDPOINT` for addresses that are used by VM instances, alias IP ranges, internal load balancers, and similar resources.
              # - `DNS_RESOLVER` for a DNS resolver address in a subnetwork
              # - `VPC_PEERING` for addresses that are reserved for VPC peer networks.
              # - `NAT_AUTO` for addresses that are external IP addresses automatically reserved for Cloud NAT.
          "address": "A String", # The static IP address represented by this resource.
          "subnetwork": "A String", # The URL of the subnetwork in which to reserve the address. If an IP address is specified, it must be within the subnetwork's IP range. This field can only be used with INTERNAL type with a GCE_ENDPOINT or DNS_RESOLVER purpose.
          "creationTimestamp": "A String", # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
          "id": "A String", # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
          "selfLink": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
          "name": "A String", # Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`. The first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for the last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit. The last character must be a lowercase letter or digit.

For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding).
