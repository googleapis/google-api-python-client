Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the customer that will receive this repricing config. Parent uses the format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Configuration for how a reseller will reprice a Customer.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Resource name of the CustomerRepricingConfig. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id}/customerRepricingConfigs/{id}.
  &quot;repricingConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for repricing a Google bill over a period of time. # Required. The configuration for bill modifications made by a reseller before sending it to customers.
    &quot;adjustment&quot;: { # A type that represents the various adjustments you can apply to a bill. # Required. Information about the adjustment.
      &quot;percentageAdjustment&quot;: { # An adjustment that applies a flat markup or markdown to an entire bill. # Flat markup or markdown on an entire bill.
        &quot;percentage&quot;: { # A representation of a decimal value, such as 2.5. Clients may convert values into language-native decimal formats, such as Java&#x27;s BigDecimal or Python&#x27;s decimal.Decimal.

          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (&quot;the integer&quot;), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -&gt; `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -&gt; `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to lower-case (`2.5E8` -&gt; `2.5e8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5e0` -&gt; `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5e-1` &lt;-&gt; `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = &#x27;+&#x27; | &#x27;-&#x27;; Significand = Digits &#x27;.&#x27; | [Digits] &#x27;.&#x27; Digits; Exponent = (&#x27;e&#x27; | &#x27;E&#x27;) [Sign] Digits; Digits = { &#x27;0&#x27; | &#x27;1&#x27; | &#x27;2&#x27; | &#x27;3&#x27; | &#x27;4&#x27; | &#x27;5&#x27; | &#x27;6&#x27; | &#x27;7&#x27; | &#x27;8&#x27; | &#x27;9&#x27; }; Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists information about how a Reseller modifies their bill before sending it to a Customer. Possible Error Codes: * PERMISSION_DENIED: If the account making the request and the account being queried are different. * NOT_FOUND: The CustomerRepricingConfig specified does not exist or is not associated with the given account. * INTERNAL: Any non-user error related to technical issues in the backend. In this case, contact Cloud Channel support. Return Value: If successful, the CustomerRepricingConfig resources. The data for each resource is displayed in the ascending order of: * customer ID * RepricingConfig.EntitlementGranularity.entitlement * RepricingConfig.effective_invoice_month * CustomerRepricingConfig.update_time If unsuccessful, returns an error.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the customer. Parent uses the format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id}. Supports accounts/{account_id}/customers/- to retrieve configs for all customers. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. A filter for [CloudChannelService.ListCustomerRepricingConfigs] results (customer only). You can use this filter when you support a BatchGet-like query. To use the filter, you must set `parent=accounts/{account_id}/customers/-`. Example: customer = accounts/account_id/customers/c1 OR customer = accounts/account_id/customers/c2.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of repricing configs to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, returns a maximum of 50 rules. The maximum value is 100; values above 100 will be coerced to 100.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A token identifying a page of results beyond the first page. Obtained through ListCustomerRepricingConfigsResponse.next_page_token of the previous CloudChannelService.ListCustomerRepricingConfigs call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -&gt; `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -&gt; `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to lower-case (`2.5E8` -&gt; `2.5e8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5e0` -&gt; `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5e-1` &lt;-&gt; `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized.
