If a user sends a hash code and the backend has requested that Scotty verify the upload against the client hash, Scotty will perform the check on behalf of the backend and will reject it if the hashes don&#x27;t match. This is set to true if Scotty performed this verification.
    &quot;inline&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Media data, set if reference_type is INLINE
    &quot;isPotentialRetry&quot;: True or False, # |is_potential_retry| is set false only when Scotty is certain that it has not sent the request before. When a client resumes an upload, this field must be set true in agent calls, because Scotty cannot be certain that it has never sent the request before due to potential failure in the session state persistence.

    Allowed values

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response for the SourceService.UploadSourceFile method.
  &quot;mediaResponseInfo&quot;: { # This message is for backends to pass their scotty media specific fields to ESF. Backend will include this in their response message to ESF. Example: ExportFile is an rpc defined for upload using scotty from ESF. rpc ExportFile(ExportFileRequest) returns (ExportFileResponse) Message ExportFileResponse will include apiserving.MediaResponseInfo to tell ESF about data like dynamic_dropzone it needs to pass to Scotty. message ExportFileResponse { optional gdata.Media blob = 1; optional apiserving.MediaResponseInfo media_response_info = 2 } # Media upload response metadata.
    &quot;customData&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Data to copy from backend response to the next backend requests. Custom data is returned to Scotty in the agent_state field, which Scotty will then provide in subsequent upload notifications.
    &quot;dataStorageTransform&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies any transformation to be applied to data before persisting it or retrieving from storage. E.g., encryption options for blobstore2. This should be of the form uploader_service.DataStorageTransform.
    &quot;destinationBlobMintIndex&quot;: 42, # For the first notification of a |diff_encoded| HttpRequestInfo, this is the index of the blob mint that Scotty should use when writing the resulting blob. This field is optional. It&#x27;s not required ever, even if `original_object_blob_mint_index` is set. In situations like that, we will use the destination blob&#x27;s mint for the destination blob and regular blob ACL checks for the original object. Note: This field is only for use by Drive API for diff uploads.
    &quot;dynamicDropTarget&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the Scotty Drop Target to use for uploads. If present in a media response, Scotty does not upload to a standard drop zone. Instead, Scotty saves the upload directly to the location specified in this drop target. Unlike drop zones, the drop target is the final storage location for an upload. So, the agent does not need to clone the blob at the end of the upload. The agent is responsible for garbage collecting any orphaned blobs that may occur due to aborted uploads. For more information, see the drop target design doc here: http://goto/ScottyDropTarget This field will be preferred to dynamicDropzone. If provided, the identified field in the response must be of the type uploader.agent.DropTarget.
    &quot;dynamicDropzone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the Scotty dropzone to use for uploads.
    &quot;mediaForDiff&quot;: { # A reference to data stored on the filesystem, on GFS or in blobstore. # Diff Updates must respond to a START notification with this Media proto to tell Scotty to decode the diff encoded payload and apply the diff against this field. If the request was diff encoded, but this field is not set, Scotty will treat the encoding as identity. This is corresponding to Apiary&#x27;s DiffUploadResponse.original_object (//depot/google3/gdata/rosy/proto/data.proto?l=413). See go/esf-scotty-diff-upload for more information.
