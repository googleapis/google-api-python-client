  <pre>Creates a Membership RBACRoleBinding.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent (project and location) where the RBACRoleBinding will be created. Specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*/memberships/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # RBACRoleBinding represents a rbacrolebinding across the Fleet
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the rbacrolebinding was created.
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the rbacrolebinding was deleted.
  &quot;group&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # group is the group, as seen by the kubernetes cluster.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels for this RBACRolebinding.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name for the rbacrolebinding `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/scopes/{scope}/rbacrolebindings/{rbacrolebinding}` or `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/memberships/{membership}/rbacrolebindings/{rbacrolebinding}`
  &quot;role&quot;: { # Role is the type for Kubernetes roles # Required. Role to bind to the principal

    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the rbacrolebinding resource.
  },
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Google-generated UUID for this resource. This is unique across all rbacrolebinding resources. If a rbacrolebinding resource is deleted and another resource with the same name is created, it gets a different uid.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the rbacrolebinding was last updated.
  &quot;user&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # user is the name of the user as seen by the kubernetes cluster, example &quot;alice&quot; or &quot;alice@domain.tld&quot;
}

  rbacrolebindingId: string, Required. Client chosen ID for the RBACRoleBinding. `rbacrolebinding_id` must be a valid RFC 1123 compliant DNS label: 1. At most 63 characters in length 2.
