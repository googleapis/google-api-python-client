<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="stop">stop(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Stop a running server.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the resource. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Message requesting to stop a server.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
