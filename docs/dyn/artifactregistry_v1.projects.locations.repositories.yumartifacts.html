<div class="method">

  <pre>Directly uploads a Yum artifact. The returned Operation will complete once the resources are uploaded. Package, Version, and File resources are created based on the imported artifact. Imported artifacts that conflict with existing resources are ignored.

Args:
  parent: string, The name of the parent resource where the artifacts will be uploaded. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request to upload an artifact.
}

  media_body: string, The filename of the media request body, or an instance of a MediaUpload object.
  media_mime_type: string, The MIME type of the media request body, or an instance of a MediaUpload object.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response to upload an artifact.
  &quot;operation&quot;: { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call. # Operation to be returned to the user.
    &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
    &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
      &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {
          &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
    },
    &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
    &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
