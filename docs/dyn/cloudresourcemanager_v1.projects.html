<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#clearOrgPolicy">clearOrgPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Clears a `Policy` from a resource.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#close">close()</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Close httplib2 connections.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#create">create(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Request that a new Project be created. The result is an Operation which can be used to track the creation process. This process usually takes a few seconds, but can sometimes take much longer. The tracking Operation is automatically deleted after a few hours, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. Authorization requires the Google IAM permission `resourcemanager.projects.create` on the specified parent for the new project. The parent is identified by a specified ResourceId, which must include both an ID and a type, such as organization. This method does not associate the new project with a billing account. You can set or update the billing account associated with a project using the [`projects.updateBillingInfo`] (/billing/reference/rest/v1/projects/updateBillingInfo) method.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#delete">delete(projectId, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Marks the Project identified by the specified `project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`) for deletion. This method will only affect the Project if it has a lifecycle state of ACTIVE. This method changes the Project's lifecycle state from ACTIVE to DELETE_REQUESTED. The deletion starts at an unspecified time, at which point the Project is no longer accessible. Until the deletion completes, you can check the lifecycle state checked by retrieving the Project with GetProject, and the Project remains visible to ListProjects. However, you cannot update the project. After the deletion completes, the Project is not retrievable by the GetProject and ListProjects methods. The caller must have delete permissions for this Project.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#get">get(projectId, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Retrieves the Project identified by the specified `project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`). The caller must have read permissions for this Project.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#getAncestry">getAncestry(projectId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets a list of ancestors in the resource hierarchy for the Project identified by the specified `project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`). The caller must have read permissions for this Project.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#getEffectiveOrgPolicy">getEffectiveOrgPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets the effective `Policy` on a resource. This is the result of merging `Policies` in the resource hierarchy. The returned `Policy` will not have an `etag`set because it is a computed `Policy` across multiple resources. Subtrees of Resource Manager resource hierarchy with 'under:' prefix will not be expanded.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns the IAM access control policy for the specified Project. Permission is denied if the policy or the resource does not exist. Authorization requires the Google IAM permission `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy` on the project. For additional information about `resource` (e.g. my-project-id) structure and identification, see [Resource Names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names).</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#getOrgPolicy">getOrgPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets a `Policy` on a resource. If no `Policy` is set on the resource, a `Policy` is returned with default values including `POLICY_TYPE_NOT_SET` for the `policy_type oneof`. The `etag` value can be used with `SetOrgPolicy()` to create or update a `Policy` during read-modify-write.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#list">list(filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Lists Projects that the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission on and satisfy the specified filter. This method returns Projects in an unspecified order. This method is eventually consistent with project mutations; this means that a newly created project may not appear in the results or recent updates to an existing project may not be reflected in the results. To retrieve the latest state of a project, use the GetProject method. NOTE: If the request filter contains a `parent.type` and `parent.id` and the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the parent, the results will be drawn from an alternate index which provides more consistent results. In future versions of this API, this List method will be split into List and Search to properly capture the behavioral difference.</p>

<p class="firstline">Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified Project. CAUTION: This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used to append additional IAM settings. NOTE: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand how the service account is being used before removing or updating its roles. For additional information about `resource` (e.g. my-project-id) structure and identification, see [Resource Names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names). The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`: + Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as `members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`. + The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group that is part of an organization. For example, group@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com organization. + Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation. + A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must explicitly accept the invitation. + You can only grant ownership of a project to a member by using the GCP Console. Inviting a member will deliver an invitation email that they must accept. An invitation email is not generated if you are granting a role other than owner, or if both the member you are inviting and the project are part of your organization. + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected. + If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is rectified. Authorization requires the Google IAM permission `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy` on the project</p>

  <code><a href="#testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified Project.

Suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced.

Example 3 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An opaque tag indicating the current version of the `Policy`, used for concurrency control. When the `Policy` is returned from either a `GetPolicy` or a `ListOrgPolicy` request, this `etag` indicates the version of the current `Policy` to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset. When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the `etag`in a `SetOrgPolicy` request will result in an unconditional write of the `Policy`.
  &quot;listPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - &quot;projects/&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot; - &quot;folders/&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot; - &quot;organizations/&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot; The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset. # List of values either allowed or disallowed.

    &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`. By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.
    &quot;suggestedValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The Google Cloud Console will try to default to a configuration that matches the value specified in this `Policy`. If `suggested_value` is not set, it will inherit the value specified higher in the hierarchy, unless `inherit_from_parent` is `false`.

Suppose that `constraint_default` is set to `ALLOW` for the `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`. Suppose that organization foo.com sets a `Policy` at their Organization resource node that restricts the allowed service activations to deny all service activations. They could then set a `Policy` with the `policy_type` `restore_default` on several experimental projects, restoring the `constraint_default` enforcement of the `Constraint` for only those projects, allowing those projects to have all services activated. # Restores the default behavior of the constraint; independent of `Constraint` type.

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.

Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.

Suppose that `constraint_default` is set to `ALLOW` for the `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`.

They could then set a `Policy` with the `policy_type` `restore_default` on several experimental projects, restoring the `constraint_default` enforcement of the `Constraint` for only those projects, allowing those projects to have all services activated. # Restores the default behavior of the constraint; independent of `Constraint` type.

  <pre>Lists Projects that the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission on and satisfy the specified filter. This method returns Projects in an unspecified order. This method is eventually consistent with project mutations; this means that a newly created project may not appear in the results or recent updates to an existing project may not be reflected in the results. To retrieve the latest state of a project, use the GetProject method. NOTE: If the request filter contains a `parent.type` and `parent.id` and the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the parent, the results will be drawn from an alternate index which provides more consistent results. In future versions of this API, this List method will be split into List and Search to properly capture the behavioral difference.

Args:
  filter: string, Optional. An expression for filtering the results of the request. Filter rules are case insensitive. If multiple fields are included in a filter query, the query will return results that match any of the fields. Some eligible fields for filtering are: + `name` + `id` + `labels.` (where *key* is the name of a label) + `parent.type` + `parent.id` + `lifecycleState` Some examples of filter strings: | Filter | Description | |------------------|-----------------------------------------------------| | name:how* | The project&#x27;s name starts with &quot;how&quot;. | | name:Howl | The project&#x27;s name is `Howl` or `howl`. | | name:HOWL | Equivalent to above. | | NAME:howl | Equivalent to above. | | labels.color:* | The project has the label `color`. | | labels.color:red | The project&#x27;s label `color` has the value `red`. | | labels.color:red labels.size:big | The project&#x27;s label `color` | : : has the value `red` and its : : : label`size` has the value : : : `big`. : | lifecycleState:DELETE_REQUESTED | Only show projects that are | : : pending deletion. : If no filter is specified, the call will return projects for which the user has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission. NOTE: To perform a by-parent query (eg., what projects are directly in a Folder), the caller must have the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the parent and the filter must contain both a `parent.type` and a `parent.id` restriction (example: &quot;parent.type:folder parent.id:123&quot;). In this case an alternate search index is used which provides more consistent results.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of Projects to return in the response. The server can return fewer Projects than requested. If unspecified, server picks an appropriate default.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A pagination token returned from a previous call to ListProjects that indicates from where listing should continue.

Suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced. Example 3 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.

When the `Policy` is returned from either a `GetPolicy` or a `ListOrgPolicy` request, this `etag` indicates the version of the current `Policy` to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset. When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the `etag`in a `SetOrgPolicy` request will result in an unconditional write of the `Policy`.
      &quot;listPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - &quot;projects/&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot; - &quot;folders/&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot; - &quot;organizations/&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot; The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset. # List of values either allowed or disallowed.

By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`.

No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`.

    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified Project. CAUTION: This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used to append additional IAM settings. NOTE: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand how the service account is being used before removing or updating its roles. For additional information about `resource` (e.g. my-project-id) structure and identification, see [Resource Names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names). The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`: + Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as `members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`. + The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group that is part of an organization. For example, group@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com organization. + Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation. + A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must explicitly accept the invitation. + You can only grant ownership of a project to a member by using the GCP Console. Inviting a member will deliver an invitation email that they must accept. An invitation email is not generated if you are granting a role other than owner, or if both the member you are inviting and the project are part of your organization. + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected. + If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is rectified. Authorization requires the Google IAM permission `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy` on the project

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`.

A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set.

Example 3 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced.

This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix.

You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values.

Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.

The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.

Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`.

No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`.
