Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

  "name": "A String", # The user-assigned display name of the Project. It must be 4 to 30 characters. Allowed characters are: lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, hyphen, single-quote, double-quote, space, and exclamation point. Example: My Project Read-write.
  "parent": { # A container to reference an id for any resource type. A `resource` in Google Cloud Platform is a generic term for something you (a developer) may want to interact with through one of our API's. Some examples are an AppEngine app, a Compute Engine instance, a Cloud SQL database, and so on. # An optional reference to a parent Resource. The only supported parent type is "organization". Once set, the parent cannot be modified. Read-write.
    "type": "A String", # Required field representing the resource type this id is for. At present, the only valid type is "organization".
    "id": "A String", # Required field for the type-specific id. This should correspond to the id used in the type-specific API's.
  },
  "projectId": "A String", # The unique, user-assigned ID of the Project. It must be 6 to 30 lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens. It must start with a letter. Trailing hyphens are prohibited. Example: tokyo-rain-123 Read-only after creation.
  "labels": { # The labels associated with this Project. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to the following regular expression: \[a-z\](\[-a-z0-9\]*\[a-z0-9\])?. Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression (\[a-z\](\[-a-z0-9\]*\[a-z0-9\])?)?. No more than 256 labels can be associated with a given resource. Clients should store labels in a representation such as JSON that does not depend on specific characters being disallowed. Example: "environment" : "dev" Read-write.

}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be: - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs # Overview The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions. # Language mapping The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C. # Other uses The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments. Example uses of this error model include: - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial errors. - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose. - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response. - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the `Status` message. - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons. # The error result of the operation in case of failure.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

        },
      ],
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If true, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should have the format of `operations/some/unique/name`.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified Project.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. `resource` is usually specified as a path. For example, a Project resource is specified as `projects/{project}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).

    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="undelete">undelete(projectId, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Restores the Project identified by the specified `project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`). You can only use this method for a Project that has a lifecycle state of DELETE_REQUESTED. After deletion starts, the Project cannot be restored. The caller must have modify permissions for this Project.
