<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="clearOrgPolicy">clearOrgPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Clears a `Policy` from a resource.

Args:
  resource: string, Name of the resource for the `Policy` to clear. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to the ClearOrgPolicy method.
    &quot;constraint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the `Constraint` of the `Policy` to clear.
    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The current version, for concurrency control. Not sending an `etag`
        # will cause the `Policy` to be cleared blindly.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Request that a new Project be created. The result is an Operation which
can be used to track the creation process. This process usually takes a few
seconds, but can sometimes take much longer. The tracking Operation is
automatically deleted after a few hours, so there is no need to call
DeleteOperation.

Authorization requires the Google IAM permission
`resourcemanager.projects.create` on the specified parent for the new
project. The parent is identified by a specified ResourceId,
which must include both an ID and a type, such as organization.

This method does not associate the new project with a billing account.
You can set or update the billing account associated with a project using
the [`projects.updateBillingInfo`]
(/billing/reference/rest/v1/projects/updateBillingInfo) method.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(projectId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Marks the Project identified by the specified
`project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`) for deletion.
This method will only affect the Project if it has a lifecycle state of
ACTIVE.

This method changes the Project&#x27;s lifecycle state from
ACTIVE
to DELETE_REQUESTED.
The deletion starts at an unspecified time,
at which point the Project is no longer accessible.

Until the deletion completes, you can check the lifecycle state
checked by retrieving the Project with GetProject,
and the Project remains visible to ListProjects.
However, you cannot update the project.

After the deletion completes, the Project is not retrievable by
the  GetProject and
ListProjects methods.

The caller must have modify permissions for this Project.

Args:
  projectId: string, The Project ID (for example, `foo-bar-123`).

          # values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration
          # simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
          # `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
          # In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
          # not present in `denied_values`.

          # For example, suppose you have a `Constraint`

      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints

        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to

        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getOrgPolicy">getOrgPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a `Policy` on a resource.

If no `Policy` is set on the resource, a `Policy` is returned with default
values including `POLICY_TYPE_NOT_SET` for the `policy_type oneof`. The
`etag` value can be used with `SetOrgPolicy()` to create or update a
`Policy` during read-modify-write.

Args:
  resource: string, Name of the resource the `Policy` is set on. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to the GetOrgPolicy method.
    &quot;constraint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the `Constraint` to get the `Policy`.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

        # are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values`
        # fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes.
        # The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values.
        # The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only
        # if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the
        # same as values with no prefix.
        # Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats:

          # resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are
          # added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.
          #
          # Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied
          # values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration
          # simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
          # `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
          # In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
          # not present in `denied_values`.
          #
          # For example, suppose you have a `Constraint`
          # `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of
          # `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.

          # `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,
          # then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(pageToken=None, pageSize=None, filter=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Projects that the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.get`
permission on and satisfy the specified filter.

This method returns Projects in an unspecified order.
This method is eventually consistent with project mutations; this means
that a newly created project may not appear in the results or recent
updates to an existing project may not be reflected in the results. To
retrieve the latest state of a project, use the
GetProject method.

NOTE: If the request filter contains a `parent.type` and `parent.id` and
the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the
parent, the results will be drawn from an alternate index which provides
more consistent results. In future versions of this API, this List method
will be split into List and Search to properly capture the behavorial
difference.

Args:
  pageToken: string, A pagination token returned from a previous call to ListProjects
that indicates from where listing should continue.

Optional.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of Projects to return in the response.
The server can return fewer Projects than requested.
If unspecified, server picks an appropriate default.

Optional.
  filter: string, An expression for filtering the results of the request.  Filter rules are
case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are:

+ `name`
+ `id`
+ `labels.&lt;key&gt;` (where *key* is the name of a label)
+ `parent.type`
+ `parent.id`

Some examples of using labels as filters:

| Filter           | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| name:how*        | The project&#x27;s name starts with &quot;how&quot;.               |
| name:Howl        | The project&#x27;s name is `Howl` or `howl`.             |
| name:HOWL        | Equivalent to above.                                |
| NAME:howl        | Equivalent to above.                                |
| labels.color:*   | The project has the label `color`.                  |
| labels.color:red | The project&#x27;s label `color` has the value `red`.    |
| labels.color:red&amp;nbsp;labels.size:big |The project&#x27;s label `color` has
  the value `red` and its label `size` has the value `big`.              |

If no filter is specified, the call will return projects for which the user
has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission.

NOTE: To perform a by-parent query (eg., what projects are directly in a
Folder), the caller must have the `resourcemanager.projects.list`
permission on the parent and the filter must contain both a `parent.type`
and a `parent.id` restriction
(example: &quot;parent.type:folder parent.id:123&quot;). In this case an alternate
search index is used which provides more consistent results.

            # are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values`
            # fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes.
            # The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values.
            # The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only
            # if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the
            # same as values with no prefix.
            # Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats:
            #     - &quot;projects/&lt;project-id&gt;&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot;
            #     - &quot;folders/&lt;folder-id&gt;&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot;

            # The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint`  defines whether
            # ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and
            # `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is
            # `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all
            # values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`,
            # `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset.
          &quot;allValues&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The policy all_values state.
          &quot;allowedValues&quot;: [ # List of values allowed  at this resource. Can only be set if `all_values`

              # that matches the value specified in this `Policy`. If `suggested_value`
              # is not set, it will inherit the value specified higher in the hierarchy,
              # unless `inherit_from_parent` is `false`.
          &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`.

              # By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supercedes any `Policy` set
              # anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is
              # set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent
              # resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are
              # added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.
              #
              # Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied
              # values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration
              # simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
              # `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
              # In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
              # not present in `denied_values`.
              #
              # For example, suppose you have a `Constraint`
              # `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of
              # `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.
              # Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that
              # restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a
              # `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has
              # `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,
              # then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.

    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified Project. Overwrites
any existing policy.

The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`:

+ Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as
`members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`.

+ The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group
that is part of an organization. For example,
group@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in
the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com
organization.

+ Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly
without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be
invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.

+ A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user
must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must
explicitly accept the invitation.

+ You can only grant ownership of a project to a member by using the
GCP Console. Inviting a member will deliver an invitation email that
they must accept. An invitation email is not generated if you are
granting a role other than owner, or if both the member you are inviting
and the project are part of your organization.

+ Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have
accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.

+ If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least
one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the
policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner
from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy
projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to
IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is
rectified.

+ This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used to
append additional IAM settings.

Note: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles
can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand
how the service account is being used before removing or updating its
roles.

Authorization requires the Google IAM permission

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
    &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`. The size of

        # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
        # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
        # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints

      &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
          # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
          # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
          # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
          # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
          # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
          # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
          #
          # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
          # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
          # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
          # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
      &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.
          #
          # Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value
          # are rejected.
          #
          # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
          # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
          #
          # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
          # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
          # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
          # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
          #   that includes conditions
          #
          # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
          # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
          # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
          # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
          #
          # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.
        #
        # Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value
        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

          # Suppose you have a `Constraint`
          # `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default`
          # set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following
          # behavior:
          #   - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial
          #     port connection attempts will be allowed.
          #   - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial
          #     port connection attempts will be refused.
          #   - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port
          #     connection attempts will be allowed.
          #   - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the
          #     resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed.
          #   - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the
          #     resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at
          #     this resource.
          #
          # The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings:
          #
          # Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins):
          #   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {enforced: false}
          #   `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set.
          # The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be
          # enforced.
          #
          # Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced):
          #   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {enforced: false}
          #   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {enforced: true}
          # The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced.
          # The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced.
          #
          # Example 3 (RestoreDefault):
          #   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {enforced: true}
          #   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {RestoreDefault: {}}
          # The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced.
