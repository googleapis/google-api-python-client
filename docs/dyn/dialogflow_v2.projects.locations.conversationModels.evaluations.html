  <pre>Creates evaluation of a conversation model.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The conversation model resource name. Format: `projects//locations//conversationModels/` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for ConversationModels.CreateConversationModelEvaluation
  &quot;conversationModelEvaluation&quot;: { # Represents evaluation result of a conversation model. # Required. The conversation model evaluation to be created.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of this model.
    &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The display name of the model evaluation. At most 64 bytes long.

          &quot;dataset&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. ConversationDataset resource name. Format: `projects//locations//conversationDatasets/`

        &quot;allowlistDocument&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The allowlist document resource name. Format: `projects//knowledgeBases//documents/`. Only used for smart compose model.
        &quot;maxResultCount&quot;: 42, # Required. The model to be evaluated can return multiple results with confidence score on each query. These results will be sorted by the descending order of the scores and we only keep the first max_result_count results as the final results to evaluate.
      },
      &quot;smartReplyConfig&quot;: { # Smart reply specific configuration for evaluation job. # Configuration for smart reply model evalution.
        &quot;allowlistDocument&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The allowlist document resource name. Format: `projects//knowledgeBases//documents/`. Only used for smart reply model.

For Smart Reply, the generated csv file contains columns of Context, (Suggestions,Q1,Q2)*3, Actual reply. Context contains at most 10 latest messages in the conversation prior to the current suggestion. Q1: &quot;Would you send it as the next message of agent?&quot; Evaluated based on whether the suggest is appropriate to be sent by agent in current context. Q2: &quot;Does the suggestion move the conversation closer to resolution?&quot; Evaluated based on whether the suggestion provide solutions, or answers customer&#x27;s question or collect information from customer to resolve the customer&#x27;s issue. Actual reply column contains the actual agent reply sent in the context.

  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
