<p class="firstline">Lists creatives as they are at the time of the initial request. This call may take multiple hours to complete. For large, paginated requests, this method returns a snapshot of creatives at the time of request for the first page. `lastStatusUpdate` and `creativeServingDecision` may be outdated for creatives on sequential pages.

  <code><a href="#watch">watch(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Watches all creatives pertaining to a bidder. It is sufficient to invoke this endpoint once per bidder. A Pub/Sub topic will be created and notifications will be pushed to the topic when any of the bidder's creatives change status. All of the bidder's service accounts will have access to read from the topic. Subsequent invocations of this method will return the existing Pub/Sub configuration.</p>

  <pre>Lists creatives as they are at the time of the initial request. This call may take multiple hours to complete. For large, paginated requests, this method returns a snapshot of creatives at the time of request for the first page. `lastStatusUpdate` and `creativeServingDecision` may be outdated for creatives on sequential pages.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the parent buyer that owns the creatives. The pattern for this resource is either `buyers/{buyerAccountId}` or `bidders/{bidderAccountId}`. For `buyers/{buyerAccountId}`, the `buyerAccountId` can be one of the following: 1. The ID of the buyer that is accessing their own creatives. 2. The ID of the child seat buyer under a bidder account. So for listing creatives pertaining to the child seat buyer (`456`) under bidder account (`123`), you would use the pattern: `buyers/456`. 3. The ID of the bidder itself. So for listing creatives pertaining to bidder (`123`), you would use `buyers/123`. If you want to access all creatives pertaining to both the bidder and all of its child seat accounts, you would use `bidders/{bidderAccountId}`, for example, for all creatives pertaining to bidder (`123`), use `bidders/123`. (required)
  filter: string, Query string to filter creatives. If no filter is specified, all active creatives will be returned. Example: &#x27;accountId=12345 AND (dealsStatus:DISAPPROVED AND disapprovalReason:UNACCEPTABLE_CONTENT) OR declaredAttributes:IS_COOKIE_TARGETED&#x27;
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. The server may return fewer creatives than requested (due to timeout constraint) even if more are available through another call. If unspecified, server will pick an appropriate default. Acceptable values are 1 to 1000, inclusive.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying a page of results the server should return. Typically, this is the value of ListCreativesResponse.nextPageToken returned from the previous call to the &#x27;ListCreatives&#x27; method. Page tokens for continued pages are valid for up to five hours, counting from the call to &#x27;ListCreatives&#x27; for the first page.
  view: string, Controls the amount of information included in the response. By default only creativeServingDecision is included. To retrieve the entire creative resource (including the declared fields and the creative content) specify the view as &quot;FULL&quot;.
    Allowed values
      CREATIVE_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - Not specified, equivalent to SERVING_DECISION_ONLY.
      SERVING_DECISION_ONLY - Only creativeServingDecision is included in the response.
      FULL - The entire creative resource (including the declared fields and the creative content) is included in the response.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
