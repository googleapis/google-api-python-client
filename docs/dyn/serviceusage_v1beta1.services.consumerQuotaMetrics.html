  <pre>Retrieves a summary of quota information for a specific quota metric

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the quota limit. An example name would be: `projects/123/services/serviceusage.googleapis.com/quotas/metrics/serviceusage.googleapis.com%2Fmutate_requests` (required)
  view: string, Specifies the level of detail for quota information in the response.
    Allowed values
      QUOTA_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - No quota view specified. Requests that do not specify a quota view will typically default to the BASIC view.
      BASIC - Only buckets with overrides are shown in the response.
      FULL - Include per-location buckets even if they do not have overrides. When the view is FULL, and a limit has regional or zonal quota, the limit will include buckets for all regions or zones that could support overrides, even if none are currently present. In some cases this will cause the response to become very large; callers that do not need this extra information should use the BASIC view instead.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

      QUOTA_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - No quota view specified. Requests that do not specify a quota view will typically default to the BASIC view.
