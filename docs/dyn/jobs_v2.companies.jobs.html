  <pre>Deprecated. Use ListJobs instead.

Lists all jobs associated with a company.

Args:
  companyName: string, Required.

The resource name of the company that owns the jobs to be listed,
such as, "companies/0000aaaa-1111-bbbb-2222-cccc3333dddd". (required)
  includeJobsCount: boolean, Deprecated. Please DO NOT use this field except for small companies.
Suggest counting jobs page by page instead.

Optional.

Set to true if the total number of open jobs is to be returned.

Defaults to false.
  pageSize: integer, Optional.

The maximum number of jobs to be returned per page of results.

If ids_only is set to true, the maximum allowed page size
is 1000. Otherwise, the maximum allowed page size is 100.

Default is 100 if empty or a number < 1 is specified.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  idsOnly: boolean, Optional.

If set to `true`, only job ID, job requisition ID and language code will be
returned.

A typical use is to synchronize job repositories.

Defaults to false.
  pageToken: string, Optional.

The starting point of a query result.
  jobRequisitionId: string, Optional.

The requisition ID, also known as posting ID, assigned by the company
to the job.

The maximum number of allowable characters is 225.
