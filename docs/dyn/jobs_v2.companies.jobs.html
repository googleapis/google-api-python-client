  <pre>Deprecated. Use ListJobs instead. Lists all jobs associated with a company.

Args:
  companyName: string, Required. The resource name of the company that owns the jobs to be listed, such as, &quot;companies/0000aaaa-1111-bbbb-2222-cccc3333dddd&quot;. (required)
  idsOnly: boolean, Optional. If set to `true`, only job ID, job requisition ID and language code will be returned. A typical use is to synchronize job repositories. Defaults to false.
  includeJobsCount: boolean, Deprecated. Please DO NOT use this field except for small companies. Suggest counting jobs page by page instead. Optional. Set to true if the total number of open jobs is to be returned. Defaults to false.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The starting point of a query result.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of jobs to be returned per page of results. If ids_only is set to true, the maximum allowed page size is 1000. Otherwise, the maximum allowed page size is 100. Default is 100 if empty or a number &lt; 1 is specified.
  jobRequisitionId: string, Optional. The requisition ID, also known as posting ID, assigned by the company to the job. The maximum number of allowable characters is 225.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Deprecated. Use ListJobsResponse instead. Output only. The List jobs response object.
    &quot;jobs&quot;: [ # The Jobs for a given company. The maximum number of items returned is based on the limit field provided in the request.
      { # A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a &quot;job listing&quot; or &quot;job requisition&quot;). A job belongs to a Company, which is the hiring entity responsible for the job.
        &quot;applicationEmailList&quot;: [ # Optional but at least one of application_urls, application_email_list or application_instruction must be specified. Use this field to specify email address(es) to which resumes or applications can be sent. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;jobTitle&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The title of the job, such as &quot;Software Engineer&quot; The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.
        &quot;filterableCustomFields&quot;: { # Deprecated. Use custom_attributes instead. Optional. A map of fields to hold filterable custom job attributes not captured by the standard fields such as job_title, company_name, or level. These custom fields store arbitrary string values, and can be used for purposes not covered by the structured fields. For the best search experience, use of the structured rather than custom fields is recommended. Data stored in these custom fields fields are indexed and searched against by keyword searches (see SearchJobsRequest.custom_field_filters][]). The map key must be a number between 1-20. If an invalid key is provided on job create or update, an error is returned.
          &quot;a_key&quot;: { # Resource that represents the custom data not captured by the standard fields.

        },
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. Resource name assigned to a job by the API, for example, &quot;/jobs/foo&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
        &quot;department&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The department or functional area within the company with the open position. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.

Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
              &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
              &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
              &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
              &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

              ],
              &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
              &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.

              &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).

        ],
        &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same requisition_id, company_name and language_code. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. The format of this field is RFC 3339 date strings. Example: 2000-01-01T00:00:00.999999999Z See [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt). A valid date range is between 1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z and 2100-12-31T23:59:59.999Z. Invalid dates are ignored and treated as expire time not provided. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided but expiry_date is, expiry_date is used. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_job_fields. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
        &quot;visibility&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The visibility of the job. Defaults to JobVisibility.PRIVATE if not specified. Currently only JobVisibility.PRIVATE is supported.

        &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job.
