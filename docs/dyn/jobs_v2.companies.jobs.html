  <pre>Deprecated. Use ListJobs instead.

Lists all jobs associated with a company.

Args:
  companyName: string, Required. The resource name of the company that owns the jobs to be listed,
such as, &quot;companies/0000aaaa-1111-bbbb-2222-cccc3333dddd&quot;. (required)

Suggest counting jobs page by page instead.

Optional.

Set to true if the total number of open jobs is to be returned.

Defaults to false.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The starting point of a query result.
  idsOnly: boolean, Optional. If set to `true`, only job ID, job requisition ID and language code will be
returned.

A typical use is to synchronize job repositories.

Defaults to false.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of jobs to be returned per page of results.

If ids_only is set to true, the maximum allowed page size
