    <code class="details" id="update">update(userId, sendAsEmail, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates a send-as alias. If a signature is provided, Gmail will sanitize the HTML before saving it with the alias. Addresses other than the primary address for the account can only be updated by service account clients that have been delegated domain-wide authority.

Args:
  userId: string, User&#x27;s email address. The special value &quot;me&quot; can be used to indicate the authenticated user. (required)

For custom &quot;from&quot; addresses, when this is empty, Gmail will populate the &quot;From:&quot; header with the name that is used for the primary address associated with the account.
