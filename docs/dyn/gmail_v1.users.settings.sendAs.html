  <pre>Creates a custom "from" send-as alias. If an SMTP MSA is specified, Gmail will attempt to connect to the SMTP service to validate the configuration before creating the alias. If ownership verification is required for the alias, a message will be sent to the email address and the resource's verification status will be set to pending; otherwise, the resource will be created with verification status set to accepted.

This method is only available to service account clients that have been delegated domain-wide authority.

Args:

    "treatAsAlias": True or False, # Whether Gmail should  treat this address as an alias for the user's primary email address. This setting only applies to custom "from" aliases.
    "sendAsEmail": "A String", # The email address that appears in the "From:" header for mail sent using this alias. This is read-only for all operations except create.
    "isPrimary": True or False, # Whether this address is the primary address used to login to the account. Every Gmail account has exactly one primary address, and it cannot be deleted from the collection of send-as aliases. This field is read-only.
    "verificationStatus": "A String", # Indicates whether this address has been verified for use as a send-as alias. Read-only. This setting only applies to custom "from" aliases.
    "isDefault": True or False, # Whether this address is selected as the default "From:" address in situations such as composing a new message or sending a vacation auto-reply. Every Gmail account has exactly one default send-as address, so the only legal value that clients may write to this field is true. Changing this from false to true for an address will result in this field becoming false for the other previous default address.
