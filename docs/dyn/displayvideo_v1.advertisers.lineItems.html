    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(advertiserId, lineItemId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a line item.
Returns error code `NOT_FOUND` if the line item does not exist.
The line item should be archived first, i.e. set
entity_status to `ENTITY_STATUS_ARCHIVED`, to be
able to delete it.

Args:
  advertiserId: string, The ID of the advertiser this line item belongs to. (required)

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(advertiserId, pageToken=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, filter=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists line items in an advertiser.

The order is defined by the order_by
parameter.
If a filter by
entity_status is not specified, line items with
`ENTITY_STATUS_ARCHIVED` will not be included in the results.

Args:
  advertiserId: string, Required. The ID of the advertiser to list line items for. (required)
  pageToken: string, A token identifying a page of results the server should return.
Typically, this is the value of
next_page_token
returned from the previous call to `ListLineItems` method.
If not specified, the first page of results will be returned.
  orderBy: string, Field by which to sort the list.
Acceptable values are:

* &quot;displayName&quot; (default)
* &quot;entityStatus&quot;

The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for
a field, a suffix &quot;desc&quot; should be added to the field name. Example:
`displayName desc`.
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. Must be between `1` and `100`. If unspecified will
default to `100`. Returns error code `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if an invalid value
is specified.
  filter: string, Allows filtering by line item properties.

Supported syntax:

* Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions.
* Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A
sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`.
* A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`.
* The operator must be `EQUALS (=)`.
* Supported fields:
    - `campaignId`
    - `insertionOrderId`
    - `entityStatus`
    - `lineItemType`.

Examples:

* All line items under an insertion order: `insertionOrderId=&quot;1234&quot;`
* All `ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE` or `ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED`
and `LINE_ITEM_TYPE_DISPLAY_DEFAULT` line items under an advertiser:
`(entityStatus=&quot;ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE&quot; OR
entityStatus=&quot;ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED&quot;) AND
lineItemType=&quot;LINE_ITEM_TYPE_DISPLAY_DEFAULT&quot;`

The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
