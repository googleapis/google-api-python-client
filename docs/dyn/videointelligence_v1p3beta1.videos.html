  <pre>Performs asynchronous video annotation. Progress and results can be retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface. `Operation.metadata` contains `AnnotateVideoProgress` (progress). `Operation.response` contains `AnnotateVideoResponse` (results).

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Video annotation request.
  &quot;features&quot;: [ # Required. Requested video annotation features.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;inputContent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The video data bytes. If unset, the input video(s) should be specified via the `input_uri`. If set, `input_uri` must be unset.
  &quot;inputUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Input video location. Currently, only [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) URIs are supported. URIs must be specified in the following format: `gs://bucket-id/object-id` (other URI formats return google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT). For more information, see [Request URIs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints). To identify multiple videos, a video URI may include wildcards in the `object-id`. Supported wildcards: &#x27;*&#x27; to match 0 or more characters; &#x27;?&#x27; to match 1 character. If unset, the input video should be embedded in the request as `input_content`. If set, `input_content` must be unset.
  &quot;locationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Cloud region where annotation should take place. Supported cloud regions are: `us-east1`, `us-west1`, `europe-west1`, `asia-east1`. If no region is specified, the region will be determined based on video file location.
  &quot;outputUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Location where the output (in JSON format) should be stored. Currently, only [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) URIs are supported.

The valid range for this threshold is [0.1, 0.9]. Any value set outside of this range will be clipped. Note: For best results, follow the default threshold. We will update the default threshold everytime when we release a new model.
      &quot;labelDetectionMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # What labels should be detected with LABEL_DETECTION, in addition to video-level labels or segment-level labels. If unspecified, defaults to `SHOT_MODE`.

Setting this for requests in other languages has no effect at all. The default &#x27;false&#x27; value does not add punctuation to result hypotheses. NOTE: &quot;This is currently offered as an experimental service, complimentary to all users. In the future this may be exclusively available as a premium feature.&quot;
      &quot;enableSpeakerDiarization&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If &#x27;true&#x27;, enables speaker detection for each recognized word in the top alternative of the recognition result using a speaker_tag provided in the WordInfo. Note: When this is true, we send all the words from the beginning of the audio for the top alternative in every consecutive response. This is done in order to improve our speaker tags as our models learn to identify the speakers in the conversation over time.
      &quot;enableWordConfidence&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If `true`, the top result includes a list of words and the confidence for those words. If `false`, no word-level confidence information is returned. The default is `false`.
      &quot;filterProfanity&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If set to `true`, the server will attempt to filter out profanities, replacing all but the initial character in each filtered word with asterisks, e.g. &quot;f***&quot;. If set to `false` or omitted, profanities won&#x27;t be filtered out.
      &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. *Required* The language of the supplied audio as a [BCP-47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag. Example: &quot;en-US&quot;. See [Language Support](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/languages) for a list of the currently supported language codes.
      &quot;maxAlternatives&quot;: 42, # Optional. Maximum number of recognition hypotheses to be returned. Specifically, the maximum number of `SpeechRecognitionAlternative` messages within each `SpeechTranscription`. The server may return fewer than `max_alternatives`. Valid values are `0`-`30`. A value of `0` or `1` will return a maximum of one. If omitted, will return a maximum of one.
      &quot;speechContexts&quot;: [ # Optional. A means to provide context to assist the speech recognition.
        { # Provides &quot;hints&quot; to the speech recognizer to favor specific words and phrases in the results.
          &quot;phrases&quot;: [ # Optional. A list of strings containing words and phrases &quot;hints&quot; so that the speech recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used to improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be used to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See [usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/speech/limits#content).

      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
