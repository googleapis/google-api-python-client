Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # [Developer Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview). A subscription to receive events about a Google Workspace resource. To learn more about subscriptions, see the [Google Workspace Events API overview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events).
  &quot;authority&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The user who authorized the creation of the subscription. Format: `users/{user}` For Google Workspace users, the `{user}` value is the [`user.id`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users#User.FIELDS.ids) field from the Directory API.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the subscription is created.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and might be sent on update requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;eventTypes&quot;: [ # Required. Immutable. Unordered list. Input for creating a subscription. Otherwise, output only. One or more types of events to receive about the target resource. Formatted according to the CloudEvents specification. The supported event types depend on the target resource of your subscription. For details, see [Supported Google Workspace events](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides#supported-events). By default, you also receive events about the [lifecycle of your subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/events-lifecycle). You don&#x27;t need to specify lifecycle events for this field. If you specify an event type that doesn&#x27;t exist for the target resource, the request returns an HTTP `400 Bad Request` status code.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Non-empty default. The timestamp in UTC when the subscription expires. Always displayed on output, regardless of what was used on input.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Immutable. Identifier. Resource name of the subscription. Format: `subscriptions/{subscription}`
  &quot;notificationEndpoint&quot;: { # The endpoint where the subscription delivers events. # Required. Immutable. The endpoint where the subscription delivers events, such as a Pub/Sub topic.
    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The Cloud Pub/Sub topic that receives events for the subscription. Format: `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}` You must create the topic in the same Google Cloud project where you create this subscription. When the topic receives events, the events are encoded as Cloud Pub/Sub messages. For details, see the [Google Cloud Pub/Sub Protocol Binding for CloudEvents](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents/blob/main/docs/spec/pubsub.md).
  },
  &quot;payloadOptions&quot;: { # Options about what data to include in the event payload. Only supported for Google Chat events. # Optional. Options about what data to include in the event payload. Only supported for Google Chat events.
    &quot;fieldMask&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. If `include_resource` is set to `true`, the list of fields to include in the event payload. Separate fields with a comma. For example, to include a Google Chat message&#x27;s sender and create time, enter `message.sender,message.createTime`. If omitted, the payload includes all fields for the resource. If you specify a field that doesn&#x27;t exist for the resource, the system ignores the field.
    &quot;includeResource&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether the event payload includes data about the resource that changed. For example, for an event where a Google Chat message was created, whether the payload contains data about the [`Message`](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.messages) resource. If false, the event payload only includes the name of the changed resource.
  },
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. If `true`, the subscription is in the process of being updated.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the subscription. Determines whether the subscription can receive events and deliver them to the notification endpoint.
  &quot;suspensionReason&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The error that suspended the subscription. To reactivate the subscription, resolve the error and call the `ReactivateSubscription` method.
  &quot;targetResource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The Google Workspace resource that&#x27;s monitored for events, formatted as the [full resource name](https://google.aip.dev/122#full-resource-names). To learn about target resources and the events that they support, see [Supported Google Workspace events](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events#supported-events). A user can only authorize your app to create one subscription for a given target resource. If your app tries to create another subscription with the same user credentials, the request returns an `ALREADY_EXISTS` error.
  &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Input only. The time-to-live (TTL) or duration for the subscription. If unspecified or set to `0`, uses the maximum possible duration.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. System-assigned unique identifier for the subscription.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last time that the subscription is updated.

Args:
  filter: string, Required. A query filter. You can filter subscriptions by event type (`event_types`) and target resource (`target_resource`). You must specify at least one event type in your query. To filter for multiple event types, use the `OR` operator. To filter by both event type and target resource, use the `AND` operator and specify the full resource name, such as `//chat.googleapis.com/spaces/{space}`. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` event_types:&quot;google.workspace.chat.membership.v1.updated&quot; OR event_types:&quot;google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created&quot; event_types:&quot;google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created&quot; AND target_resource=&quot;//chat.googleapis.com/spaces/{space}&quot; ( event_types:&quot;google.workspace.chat.membership.v1.updated&quot; OR event_types:&quot;google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created&quot; ) AND target_resource=&quot;//chat.googleapis.com/spaces/{space}&quot; ``` The server rejects invalid queries with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of subscriptions to return. The service might return fewer than this value. If unspecified or set to `0`, up to 50 subscriptions are returned. The maximum value is 100. If you specify a value more than 100, the system only returns 100 subscriptions.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous list subscriptions call. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, the filter value should match the call that provided the page token. Passing a different value might lead to unexpected results.

  <pre>[Developer Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview): Updates or renews a Google Workspace subscription. To learn how to use this method, see [Update or renew a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/update-subscription).

Args:
  name: string, Optional. Immutable. Identifier. Resource name of the subscription. Format: `subscriptions/{subscription}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # [Developer Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview). A subscription to receive events about a Google Workspace resource. To learn more about subscriptions, see the [Google Workspace Events API overview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events).
  &quot;authority&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The user who authorized the creation of the subscription. Format: `users/{user}` For Google Workspace users, the `{user}` value is the [`user.id`](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users#User.FIELDS.ids) field from the Directory API.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the subscription is created.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and might be sent on update requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;eventTypes&quot;: [ # Required. Immutable. Unordered list. Input for creating a subscription. Otherwise, output only. One or more types of events to receive about the target resource. Formatted according to the CloudEvents specification. The supported event types depend on the target resource of your subscription. For details, see [Supported Google Workspace events](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides#supported-events). By default, you also receive events about the [lifecycle of your subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/events-lifecycle). You don&#x27;t need to specify lifecycle events for this field. If you specify an event type that doesn&#x27;t exist for the target resource, the request returns an HTTP `400 Bad Request` status code.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Non-empty default. The timestamp in UTC when the subscription expires. Always displayed on output, regardless of what was used on input.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Immutable. Identifier. Resource name of the subscription. Format: `subscriptions/{subscription}`
  &quot;notificationEndpoint&quot;: { # The endpoint where the subscription delivers events. # Required. Immutable. The endpoint where the subscription delivers events, such as a Pub/Sub topic.
    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The Cloud Pub/Sub topic that receives events for the subscription. Format: `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}` You must create the topic in the same Google Cloud project where you create this subscription. When the topic receives events, the events are encoded as Cloud Pub/Sub messages. For details, see the [Google Cloud Pub/Sub Protocol Binding for CloudEvents](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloudevents/blob/main/docs/spec/pubsub.md).
  },
  &quot;payloadOptions&quot;: { # Options about what data to include in the event payload. Only supported for Google Chat events. # Optional. Options about what data to include in the event payload. Only supported for Google Chat events.
    &quot;fieldMask&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. If `include_resource` is set to `true`, the list of fields to include in the event payload. Separate fields with a comma. For example, to include a Google Chat message&#x27;s sender and create time, enter `message.sender,message.createTime`. If omitted, the payload includes all fields for the resource. If you specify a field that doesn&#x27;t exist for the resource, the system ignores the field.
    &quot;includeResource&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether the event payload includes data about the resource that changed. For example, for an event where a Google Chat message was created, whether the payload contains data about the [`Message`](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.messages) resource. If false, the event payload only includes the name of the changed resource.
  },
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. If `true`, the subscription is in the process of being updated.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the subscription. Determines whether the subscription can receive events and deliver them to the notification endpoint.
