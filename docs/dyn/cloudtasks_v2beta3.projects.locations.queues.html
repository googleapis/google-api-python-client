Args:
  parent: string, Required. The location name in which the queue will be created. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID` The list of allowed locations can be obtained by calling Cloud Tasks&#x27; implementation of ListLocations. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A queue is a container of related tasks. Queues are configured to manage how those tasks are dispatched. Configurable properties include rate limits, retry options, queue types, and others.
  &quot;appEngineHttpQueue&quot;: { # App Engine HTTP queue. The task will be delivered to the App Engine application hostname specified by its AppEngineHttpQueue and AppEngineHttpRequest. The documentation for AppEngineHttpRequest explains how the task&#x27;s host URL is constructed. Using AppEngineHttpQueue requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` # AppEngineHttpQueue settings apply only to App Engine tasks in this queue. Http tasks are not affected by this proto.
    &quot;appEngineRoutingOverride&quot;: { # App Engine Routing. Defines routing characteristics specific to App Engine - service, version, and instance. For more information about services, versions, and instances see [An Overview of App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine), [Microservices Architecture on Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/microservices-on-app-engine), [App Engine Standard request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed), and [App Engine Flex request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed). # Overrides for the task-level app_engine_routing. If set, `app_engine_routing_override` is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing.
      &quot;host&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The host that the task is sent to. The host is constructed from the domain name of the app associated with the queue&#x27;s project ID (for example .appspot.com), and the service, version, and instance. Tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK might have a custom domain name. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed).
      &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # App instance. By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted. Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if [manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine?hl=en_US#scaling_types_and_instance_classes). App Engine Flex does not support instances. For more information, see [App Engine Standard request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and [App Engine Flex request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed).
      &quot;service&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # App service. By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted. For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance. For example, some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If host is not parsable, then service, version, and instance are the empty string.
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # App version. By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted. For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance. For example, some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If host is not parsable, then service, version, and instance are the empty string.

  &quot;httpTarget&quot;: { # HTTP target. When specified as a Queue, all the tasks with [HttpRequest] will be overridden according to the target. # Modifies HTTP target for HTTP tasks.
    &quot;headerOverrides&quot;: [ # HTTP target headers. This map contains the header field names and values. Headers will be set when running the CreateTask and/or BufferTask. These headers represent a subset of the headers that will be configured for the task&#x27;s HTTP request. Some HTTP request headers will be ignored or replaced. A partial list of headers that will be ignored or replaced is: * Several predefined headers, prefixed with &quot;X-CloudTasks-&quot;, can be used to define properties of the task. * Host: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks and derived from HttpRequest.url. * Content-Length: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks. `Content-Type` won&#x27;t be set by Cloud Tasks. You can explicitly set `Content-Type` to a media type when the task is created. For example,`Content-Type` can be set to `&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;` or `&quot;application/json&quot;`. The default value is set to &quot;application/json&quot;`. * User-Agent: This will be set to `&quot;Google-Cloud-Tasks&quot;`. Headers which can have multiple values (according to RFC2616) can be specified using comma-separated values. The size of the headers must be less than 80KB. Queue-level headers to override headers of all the tasks in the queue.
      { # Wraps the Header object.
        &quot;header&quot;: { # Defines a header message. A header can have a key and a value. # header embodying a key and a value.

          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Value of the header.
        },
      },
    ],
    &quot;httpMethod&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP method to use for the request. When specified, it will override HttpRequest for the task. Note that if the value is set to HttpMethod the HttpRequest of the task will be ignored at execution time.
    &quot;uriOverride&quot;: { # URI Override. When specified, all the HTTP tasks inside the queue will be partially or fully overridden depending on the configured values. # URI override. When specified, modifies the execution URI for all the tasks in the queue.
      &quot;host&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Host override. When specified, will replace the host part of the task URL. For example, if the task URL is &quot;https://www.google.com&quot;, and host value is set to &quot;example.net&quot;, the overridden URI will be changed to &quot;https://example.net&quot;. Host value cannot be an empty string.
      &quot;pathOverride&quot;: { # PathOverride. Path message defines path override for HTTP targets. # URI path. When specified, will replace the existing path of the task URL. Setting the path value to an empty string clears the URI path segment.
        &quot;path&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URI path (e.g., a/b/c). Default is Empty string.
      },
      &quot;port&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Port override. When specified, will replace the port part of the task URI. For instance, for a URI http://www.google.com/foo and port=123, the overridden URI becomes http://www.google.com:123/foo. Note that the port value must be a positive integer. Setting the port to 0 (Zero) clears the URI port.
      &quot;queryOverride&quot;: { # QueryOverride. Query message defines query override for HTTP targets. # URI Query. When specified, will replace the query part of the task URI. Setting the query value to an empty string clears the URI query segment.
        &quot;queryParams&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The query parameters (e.g., qparam1=123&amp;qparam2=456). Default is Empty string.
      },
      &quot;scheme&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Scheme override. When specified, the task URI scheme is replaced by the provided value (HTTP or HTTPS).
      &quot;uriOverrideEnforceMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # URI Override Enforce Mode When specified, determines the Target UriOverride mode. If not specified, it defaults to ALWAYS.
    },
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue, after which it becomes output only. The queue name. The queue name must have the following format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue&#x27;s location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.
  &quot;purgeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last time this queue was purged. All tasks that were created before this time were purged. A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue). Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
  &quot;rateLimits&quot;: { # Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
    &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.
    &quot;maxConcurrentDispatches&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of concurrent requests decreases. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. The maximum allowed value is 5,000. This field has the same meaning as [max_concurrent_requests in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#max_concurrent_requests).
    &quot;maxDispatchesPerSecond&quot;: 3.14, # The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. * For App Engine queues, the maximum allowed value is 500. This field has the same meaning as [rate in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#rate).
  },
  &quot;retryConfig&quot;: { # Retry config. These settings determine when a failed task attempt is retried. # Settings that determine the retry behavior. * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks. Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK. See [App Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/retrying-tasks).
    &quot;maxAttempts&quot;: 42, # Number of attempts per task. Cloud Tasks will attempt the task `max_attempts` times (that is, if the first attempt fails, then there will be `max_attempts - 1` retries). Must be &gt;= -1. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. -1 indicates unlimited attempts. This field has the same meaning as [task_retry_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue&#x27;s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_backoff` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field has the same meaning as [max_doublings in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxRetryDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If positive, `max_retry_duration` specifies the time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once `max_retry_duration` time has passed *and* the task has been attempted max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and the task will be deleted. If zero, then the task age is unlimited. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_retry_duration` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [task_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;minBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue&#x27;s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `min_backoff` will be truncated to the nearest second.

    &quot;concurrentDispatchesCount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The number of requests that the queue has dispatched but has not received a reply for yet.
    &quot;effectiveExecutionRate&quot;: 3.14, # Output only. The current maximum number of tasks per second executed by the queue. The maximum value of this variable is controlled by the RateLimits of the Queue. However, this value could be less to avoid overloading the endpoints tasks in the queue are targeting.

  },
  &quot;taskTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The maximum amount of time that a task will be retained in this queue. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default `task_ttl` of 31 days. After a task has lived for `task_ttl`, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The `task_ttl` for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a [storage quota](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/quotas#Task_Queue) for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see the documentation for Duration.
  &quot;tombstoneTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The task tombstone time to live (TTL).

Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
    &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.

This field has the same meaning as [max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.

    },
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue, after which it becomes output only. The queue name. The queue name must have the following format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue&#x27;s location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.
  &quot;purgeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last time this queue was purged. All tasks that were created before this time were purged. A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue). Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
  &quot;rateLimits&quot;: { # Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
    &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.
    &quot;maxConcurrentDispatches&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of concurrent requests decreases. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. The maximum allowed value is 5,000. This field has the same meaning as [max_concurrent_requests in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#max_concurrent_requests).
    &quot;maxDispatchesPerSecond&quot;: 3.14, # The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.

  },
  &quot;retryConfig&quot;: { # Retry config. These settings determine when a failed task attempt is retried. # Settings that determine the retry behavior. * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks. Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK.

    &quot;maxAttempts&quot;: 42, # Number of attempts per task. Cloud Tasks will attempt the task `max_attempts` times (that is, if the first attempt fails, then there will be `max_attempts - 1` retries). Must be &gt;= -1. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. -1 indicates unlimited attempts. This field has the same meaning as [task_retry_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue&#x27;s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_backoff` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field has the same meaning as [max_doublings in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxRetryDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If positive, `max_retry_duration` specifies the time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once `max_retry_duration` time has passed *and* the task has been attempted max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and the task will be deleted. If zero, then the task age is unlimited. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_retry_duration` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [task_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;minBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue&#x27;s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried.

  &quot;taskTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The maximum amount of time that a task will be retained in this queue. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default `task_ttl` of 31 days. After a task has lived for `task_ttl`, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The `task_ttl` for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a [storage quota](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/quotas#Task_Queue) for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see the documentation for Duration.
  &quot;tombstoneTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The task tombstone time to live (TTL).

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
      &quot;rateLimits&quot;: { # Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
        &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.
        &quot;maxConcurrentDispatches&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of concurrent requests decreases. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. The maximum allowed value is 5,000.

If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_backoff` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
        &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.

        &quot;maxRetryDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If positive, `max_retry_duration` specifies the time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once `max_retry_duration` time has passed *and* the task has been attempted max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and the task will be deleted. If zero, then the task age is unlimited. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_retry_duration` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [task_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).

Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
    &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.

    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.

Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.

This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.

    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.

This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size).

The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
