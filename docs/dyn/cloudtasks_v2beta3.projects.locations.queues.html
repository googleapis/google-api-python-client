Args:
  parent: string, Required. The location name in which the queue will be created. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID` The list of allowed locations can be obtained by calling Cloud Tasks&#x27; implementation of ListLocations. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A queue is a container of related tasks. Queues are configured to manage how those tasks are dispatched. Configurable properties include rate limits, retry options, queue types, and others.
  &quot;appEngineHttpQueue&quot;: { # App Engine HTTP queue. The task will be delivered to the App Engine application hostname specified by its AppEngineHttpQueue and AppEngineHttpRequest. The documentation for AppEngineHttpRequest explains how the task&#x27;s host URL is constructed. Using AppEngineHttpQueue requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` # AppEngineHttpQueue settings apply only to App Engine tasks in this queue. Http tasks are not affected by this proto.
    &quot;appEngineRoutingOverride&quot;: { # App Engine Routing. Defines routing characteristics specific to App Engine - service, version, and instance. For more information about services, versions, and instances see [An Overview of App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine), [Microservices Architecture on Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/microservices-on-app-engine), [App Engine Standard request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed), and [App Engine Flex request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed). # Overrides for the task-level app_engine_routing. If set, `app_engine_routing_override` is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing.
      &quot;host&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The host that the task is sent to. The host is constructed from the domain name of the app associated with the queue&#x27;s project ID (for example .appspot.com), and the service, version, and instance. Tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK might have a custom domain name. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed).
      &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # App instance. By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted. Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if [manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine?hl=en_US#scaling_types_and_instance_classes). App Engine Flex does not support instances. For more information, see [App Engine Standard request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed) and [App Engine Flex request routing](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/how-requests-are-routed).
      &quot;service&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # App service. By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted. For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance. For example, some tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK use a custom domain name; custom domains are not parsed by Cloud Tasks. If host is not parsable, then service, version, and instance are the empty string.
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # App version. By default, the task is sent to the version which is the default version when the task is attempted. For some queues or tasks which were created using the App Engine Task Queue API, host is not parsable into service, version, and instance.

    },
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue, after which it becomes output only. The queue name. The queue name must have the following format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue&#x27;s location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.
  &quot;purgeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last time this queue was purged. All tasks that were created before this time were purged. A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue). Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
  &quot;rateLimits&quot;: { # Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
    &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.
    &quot;maxConcurrentDispatches&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of concurrent requests decreases. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. The maximum allowed value is 5,000. This field has the same meaning as [max_concurrent_requests in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#max_concurrent_requests).
    &quot;maxDispatchesPerSecond&quot;: 3.14, # The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. * For App Engine queues, the maximum allowed value is 500. This field has the same meaning as [rate in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#rate).
  },
  &quot;retryConfig&quot;: { # Retry config. These settings determine when a failed task attempt is retried. # Settings that determine the retry behavior. * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks. Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK. See [App Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/retrying-tasks).
    &quot;maxAttempts&quot;: 42, # Number of attempts per task. Cloud Tasks will attempt the task `max_attempts` times (that is, if the first attempt fails, then there will be `max_attempts - 1` retries). Must be &gt;= -1. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. -1 indicates unlimited attempts. This field has the same meaning as [task_retry_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue&#x27;s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_backoff` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field has the same meaning as [max_doublings in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxRetryDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If positive, `max_retry_duration` specifies the time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once `max_retry_duration` time has passed *and* the task has been attempted max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and the task will be deleted. If zero, then the task age is unlimited. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_retry_duration` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [task_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;minBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue&#x27;s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `min_backoff` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [min_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).

  &quot;stackdriverLoggingConfig&quot;: { # Configuration options for writing logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/). # Configuration options for writing logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/). If this field is unset, then no logs are written.
    &quot;samplingRatio&quot;: 3.14, # Specifies the fraction of operations to write to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/). This field may contain any value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. 0.0 is the default and means that no operations are logged.
  },
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the queue. `state` can only be changed by called PauseQueue, ResumeQueue, or uploading [queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref). UpdateQueue cannot be used to change `state`.
  &quot;stats&quot;: { # Statistics for a queue. # Output only. The realtime, informational statistics for a queue. In order to receive the statistics the caller should include this field in the FieldMask.
    &quot;concurrentDispatchesCount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The number of requests that the queue has dispatched but has not received a reply for yet.
    &quot;effectiveExecutionRate&quot;: 3.14, # Output only. The current maximum number of tasks per second executed by the queue. The maximum value of this variable is controlled by the RateLimits of the Queue. However, this value could be less to avoid overloading the endpoints tasks in the queue are targeting.
    &quot;executedLastMinuteCount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The number of tasks that the queue has dispatched and received a reply for during the last minute. This variable counts both successful and non-successful executions.
    &quot;oldestEstimatedArrivalTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. An estimation of the nearest time in the future where a task in the queue is scheduled to be executed.
    &quot;tasksCount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. An estimation of the number of tasks in the queue, that is, the tasks in the queue that haven&#x27;t been executed, the tasks in the queue which the queue has dispatched but has not yet received a reply for, and the failed tasks that the queue is retrying.
  },
  &quot;taskTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The maximum amount of time that a task will be retained in this queue. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default `task_ttl` of 31 days. After a task has lived for `task_ttl`, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The `task_ttl` for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a [storage quota](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/quotas#Task_Queue) for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see the documentation for Duration.
  &quot;tombstoneTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The task tombstone time to live (TTL). After a task is deleted or executed, the task&#x27;s tombstone is retained for the length of time specified by `tombstone_ttl`. The tombstone is used by task de-duplication; another task with the same name can&#x27;t be created until the tombstone has expired. For more information about task de-duplication, see the documentation for CreateTaskRequest. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default `tombstone_ttl` of 1 hour.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of a queue (push or pull). `Queue.type` is an immutable property of the queue that is set at the queue creation time. When left unspecified, the default value of `PUSH` is selected.

Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
  &quot;rateLimits&quot;: { # Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
    &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.

    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.

  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.
  &quot;options&quot;: { # Encapsulates settings provided to GetIamPolicy. # OPTIONAL: A `GetPolicyOptions` object for specifying options to `GetIamPolicy`.
    &quot;requestedPolicyVersion&quot;: 42, # Optional. The policy format version to be returned. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3. Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
  },
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, readMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists queues. Queues are returned in lexicographical order.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The location name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID` (required)
  filter: string, `filter` can be used to specify a subset of queues. Any Queue field can be used as a filter and several operators as supported. For example: `&lt;=, &lt;, &gt;=, &gt;, !=, =, :`. The filter syntax is the same as described in [Stackdriver&#x27;s Advanced Logs Filters](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters). Sample filter &quot;state: PAUSED&quot;. Note that using filters might cause fewer queues than the requested page_size to be returned.
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. The maximum page size is 9800. If unspecified, the page size will be the maximum. Fewer queues than requested might be returned, even if more queues exist; use the next_page_token in the response to determine if more queues exist.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying the page of results to return. To request the first page results, page_token must be empty. To request the next page of results, page_token must be the value of next_page_token returned from the previous call to ListQueues method. It is an error to switch the value of the filter while iterating through pages.
  readMask: string, Optional. Read mask is used for a more granular control over what the API returns. If the mask is not present all fields will be returned except [Queue.stats]. [Queue.stats] will be returned only if it was explicitly specified in the mask.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for ListQueues.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A token to retrieve next page of results. To return the next page of results, call ListQueues with this value as the page_token. If the next_page_token is empty, there are no more results. The page token is valid for only 2 hours.
  &quot;queues&quot;: [ # The list of queues.
    { # A queue is a container of related tasks. Queues are configured to manage how those tasks are dispatched. Configurable properties include rate limits, retry options, queue types, and others.
      &quot;appEngineHttpQueue&quot;: { # App Engine HTTP queue. The task will be delivered to the App Engine application hostname specified by its AppEngineHttpQueue and AppEngineHttpRequest. The documentation for AppEngineHttpRequest explains how the task&#x27;s host URL is constructed. Using AppEngineHttpQueue requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` # AppEngineHttpQueue settings apply only to App Engine tasks in this queue.

          &quot;host&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The host that the task is sent to. The host is constructed from the domain name of the app associated with the queue&#x27;s project ID (for example .appspot.com), and the service, version, and instance. Tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK might have a custom domain name. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed).
          &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # App instance. By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted. Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if [manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine?hl=en_US#scaling_types_and_instance_classes).

      },
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue, after which it becomes output only. The queue name. The queue name must have the following format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue&#x27;s location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.
      &quot;purgeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last time this queue was purged. All tasks that were created before this time were purged. A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue). Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
      &quot;rateLimits&quot;: { # Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
        &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.
        &quot;maxConcurrentDispatches&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of concurrent requests decreases. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. The maximum allowed value is 5,000. This field has the same meaning as [max_concurrent_requests in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#max_concurrent_requests).
        &quot;maxDispatchesPerSecond&quot;: 3.14, # The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. * For App Engine queues, the maximum allowed value is 500.

These settings determine when a failed task attempt is retried. # Settings that determine the retry behavior. * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks. Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK. See [App Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/retrying-tasks).

Cloud Tasks will attempt the task `max_attempts` times (that is, if the first attempt fails, then there will be `max_attempts - 1` retries). Must be &gt;= -1. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. -1 indicates unlimited attempts. This field has the same meaning as [task_retry_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
        &quot;maxBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue&#x27;s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_backoff` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
        &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field has the same meaning as [max_doublings in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
        &quot;maxRetryDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If positive, `max_retry_duration` specifies the time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once `max_retry_duration` time has passed *and* the task has been attempted max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and the task will be deleted. If zero, then the task age is unlimited. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_retry_duration` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [task_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
        &quot;minBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A task will be scheduled for retry between min_backoff and max_backoff duration after it fails, if the queue&#x27;s RetryConfig specifies that the task should be retried.

  <pre>Updates a queue. This method creates the queue if it does not exist and updates the queue if it does exist. Queues created with this method allow tasks to live for a maximum of 31 days. After a task is 31 days old, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. WARNING: Using this method may have unintended side effects if you are using an App Engine `queue.yaml` or `queue.xml` file to manage your queues. Read [Overview of Queue Management and queue.yaml](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/queue-yaml) before using this method.

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A queue is a container of related tasks. Queues are configured to manage how those tasks are dispatched. Configurable properties include rate limits, retry options, queue types, and others.
  &quot;appEngineHttpQueue&quot;: { # App Engine HTTP queue. The task will be delivered to the App Engine application hostname specified by its AppEngineHttpQueue and AppEngineHttpRequest. The documentation for AppEngineHttpRequest explains how the task&#x27;s host URL is constructed. Using AppEngineHttpQueue requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` # AppEngineHttpQueue settings apply only to App Engine tasks in this queue.

If set, `app_engine_routing_override` is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level app_engine_routing.
      &quot;host&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The host that the task is sent to. The host is constructed from the domain name of the app associated with the queue&#x27;s project ID (for example .appspot.com), and the service, version, and instance. Tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK might have a custom domain name. For more information, see [How Requests are Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed).
      &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # App instance. By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted. Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if [manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine?hl=en_US#scaling_types_and_instance_classes).

A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue). Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
  &quot;rateLimits&quot;: { # Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
    &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.
    &quot;maxConcurrentDispatches&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of concurrent requests decreases. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. The maximum allowed value is 5,000. This field has the same meaning as [max_concurrent_requests in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#max_concurrent_requests).
    &quot;maxDispatchesPerSecond&quot;: 3.14, # The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. * For App Engine queues, the maximum allowed value is 500.

  },
  &quot;retryConfig&quot;: { # Retry config. These settings determine when a failed task attempt is retried. # Settings that determine the retry behavior. * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks. Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK.

If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_backoff` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [max_backoff_seconds in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. This field has the same meaning as [max_doublings in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).
    &quot;maxRetryDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If positive, `max_retry_duration` specifies the time limit for retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first attempted. Once `max_retry_duration` time has passed *and* the task has been attempted max_attempts times, no further attempts will be made and the task will be deleted. If zero, then the task age is unlimited. If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default. `max_retry_duration` will be truncated to the nearest second. This field has the same meaning as [task_age_limit in queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#retry_parameters).

    &quot;concurrentDispatchesCount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The number of requests that the queue has dispatched but has not received a reply for yet.
    &quot;effectiveExecutionRate&quot;: 3.14, # Output only. The current maximum number of tasks per second executed by the queue. The maximum value of this variable is controlled by the RateLimits of the Queue. However, this value could be less to avoid overloading the endpoints tasks in the queue are targeting.

  },
  &quot;taskTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The maximum amount of time that a task will be retained in this queue. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default `task_ttl` of 31 days. After a task has lived for `task_ttl`, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The `task_ttl` for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a [storage quota](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/quotas#Task_Queue) for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see the documentation for Duration.
  &quot;tombstoneTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The task tombstone time to live (TTL).

However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
    &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.

    &quot;maxDoublings&quot;: 42, # The time between retries will double `max_doublings` times. A task&#x27;s retry interval starts at min_backoff, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff up to max_attempts times. For example, if min_backoff is 10s, max_backoff is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a task will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the task will retry at intervals of max_backoff until the task has been attempted max_attempts times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, .... If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.

The host is constructed from the domain name of the app associated with the queue&#x27;s project ID (for example .appspot.com), and the service, version, and instance. Tasks which were created using the App Engine SDK might have a custom domain name.

      &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # App instance. By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted. Requests can only be sent to a specific instance if [manual scaling is used in App Engine Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/an-overview-of-app-engine?hl=en_US#scaling_types_and_instance_classes).

Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
  &quot;rateLimits&quot;: { # Rate limits. This message determines the maximum rate that tasks can be dispatched by a queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is a first task attempt or a retry. Note: The debugging command, RunTask, will run a task even if the queue has reached its RateLimits. # Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue&#x27;s actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue&#x27;s state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
    &quot;maxBurstSize&quot;: 42, # The max burst size. Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time. The [token bucket](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_Bucket) algorithm is used to control the rate of task dispatches. Each queue has a token bucket that holds tokens, up to the maximum specified by `max_burst_size`. Each time a task is dispatched, a token is removed from the bucket. Tasks will be dispatched until the queue&#x27;s bucket runs out of tokens. The bucket will be continuously refilled with new tokens based on max_dispatches_per_second. The default value of `max_burst_size` is picked by Cloud Tasks based on the value of max_dispatches_per_second. The maximum value of `max_burst_size` is 500. For App Engine queues that were created or updated using `queue.yaml/xml`, `max_burst_size` is equal to [bucket_size](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/queueref#bucket_size). If UpdateQueue is called on a queue without explicitly setting a value for `max_burst_size`, `max_burst_size` value will get updated if UpdateQueue is updating max_dispatches_per_second.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on a Queue. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
