The following system labels exist for each Dataset: * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/dataset_metadata_schema`: output only. Its value is the metadata_schema&#x27;s title.

  <pre>Write time series data points of multiple TensorboardTimeSeries in multiple TensorboardRun&#x27;s. If any data fail to be ingested, an error is returned.

Args:
  tensorboardExperiment: string, Required. The resource name of the TensorboardExperiment to write data to. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/tensorboards/{tensorboard}/experiments/{experiment}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for TensorboardService.WriteTensorboardExperimentData.
  &quot;writeRunDataRequests&quot;: [ # Required. Requests containing per-run TensorboardTimeSeries data to write.
    { # Request message for TensorboardService.WriteTensorboardRunData.
      &quot;tensorboardRun&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource name of the TensorboardRun to write data to. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/tensorboards/{tensorboard}/experiments/{experiment}/runs/{run}`
      &quot;timeSeriesData&quot;: [ # Required. The TensorboardTimeSeries data to write. Values with in a time series are indexed by their step value. Repeated writes to the same step will overwrite the existing value for that step. The upper limit of data points per write request is 5000.
        { # All the data stored in a TensorboardTimeSeries.
          &quot;tensorboardTimeSeriesId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The ID of the TensorboardTimeSeries, which will become the final component of the TensorboardTimeSeries&#x27; resource name
          &quot;valueType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The value type of this time series. All the values in this time series data must match this value type.
          &quot;values&quot;: [ # Required. Data points in this time series.
            { # A TensorboardTimeSeries data point.
              &quot;blobs&quot;: { # One point viewable on a blob metric plot, but mostly just a wrapper message to work around repeated fields can&#x27;t be used directly within `oneof` fields. # A blob sequence value.
                &quot;values&quot;: [ # List of blobs contained within the sequence.
                  { # One blob (e.g, image, graph) viewable on a blob metric plot.
                    &quot;data&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The bytes of the blob is not present unless it&#x27;s returned by the ReadTensorboardBlobData endpoint.
                    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A URI safe key uniquely identifying a blob. Can be used to locate the blob stored in the Cloud Storage bucket of the consumer project.
                  },
                ],
              },
              &quot;scalar&quot;: { # One point viewable on a scalar metric plot. # A scalar value.
                &quot;value&quot;: 3.14, # Value of the point at this step / timestamp.
              },
              &quot;step&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Step index of this data point within the run.
              &quot;tensor&quot;: { # One point viewable on a tensor metric plot. # A tensor value.
                &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Serialized form of https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.proto
                &quot;versionNumber&quot;: 42, # Optional. Version number of TensorProto used to serialize value.
              },
              &quot;wallTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Wall clock timestamp when this data point is generated by the end user.
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for TensorboardService.WriteTensorboardExperimentData.
