      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).

    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="updateRollout">updateRollout(name, body=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Patches a single game server deployment rollout.
The method will not return an error if the update does not affect any
existing realms. For example - if the default_game_server_config is changed
but all existing realms use the override, that is valid. Similarly, if a
non existing realm is explicitly called out in game_server_config_overrides
field, that will also not result in an error.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the game server deployment rollout. Uses the form:

`projects/{project}/locations/{location}/gameServerDeployments/{deployment}/rollout`.
For example,

`projects/my-project/locations/{location}/gameServerDeployments/my-deployment/rollout`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The game server deployment rollout which represents the desired rollout
      # state.
    &quot;defaultGameServerConfig&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The default game server config is applied to all realms unless overridden
        # in the rollout. For example,

    &quot;gameServerConfigOverrides&quot;: [ # Contains the game server config rollout overrides. Overrides are processed

        # of the list is not processed.
