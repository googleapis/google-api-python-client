  <pre>Updates a `Registration`&#x27;s contact settings. Some changes require confirmation by the domain&#x27;s registrant contact .

Args:
  registration: string, Required. The name of the `Registration` whose contact settings are being updated, in the format `projects/*/locations/*/registrations/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `ConfigureContactSettings` method.
  &quot;contactNotices&quot;: [ # The list of contact notices that the caller acknowledges. The notices needed here depend on the values specified in `contact_settings`.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;contactSettings&quot;: { # Defines the contact information associated with a `Registration`. [ICANN](https://icann.org/) requires all domain names to have associated contact information. The `registrant_contact` is considered the domain&#x27;s legal owner, and often the other contacts are identical. # Fields of the `ContactSettings` to update.
    &quot;adminContact&quot;: { # Details required for a contact associated with a `Registration`. # Required. The administrative contact for the `Registration`.
      &quot;email&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Email address of the contact.
      &quot;faxNumber&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Fax number of the contact in international format. For example, `&quot;+1-800-555-0123&quot;`.
      &quot;phoneNumber&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Phone number of the contact in international format. For example, `&quot;+1-800-555-0123&quot;`.
      &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Required. Postal address of the contact.
        &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
        &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
        &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
        &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
        &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
        &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
        &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
        &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Required. Postal address of the contact.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.

This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="register">register(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Registers a new domain name and creates a corresponding `Registration` resource. Call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` first to check availability of the domain name and determine parameters like price that are needed to build a call to this method. A successful call creates a `Registration` resource in state `REGISTRATION_PENDING`, which resolves to `ACTIVE` within 1-2 minutes, indicating that the domain was successfully registered. If the resource ends up in state `REGISTRATION_FAILED`, it indicates that the domain was not registered successfully, and you can safely delete the resource and retry registration.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the `Registration`. Must be in the format `projects/*/locations/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `RegisterDomain` method.
  &quot;contactNotices&quot;: [ # The list of contact notices that the caller acknowledges. The notices needed here depend on the values specified in `registration.contact_settings`.
    &quot;A String&quot;,

  &quot;registration&quot;: { # The `Registration` resource facilitates managing and configuring domain name registrations. To create a new `Registration` resource, find a suitable domain name by calling the `SearchDomains` method with a query to see available domain name options. After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to `RegisterDomain`. # Required. The complete `Registration` resource to be created.
    &quot;contactSettings&quot;: { # Defines the contact information associated with a `Registration`. [ICANN](https://icann.org/) requires all domain names to have associated contact information. The `registrant_contact` is considered the domain&#x27;s legal owner, and often the other contacts are identical. # Required. Settings for contact information linked to the `Registration`. You cannot update these with the `UpdateRegistration` method. To update these settings, use the `ConfigureContactSettings` method.
      &quot;adminContact&quot;: { # Details required for a contact associated with a `Registration`. # Required. The administrative contact for the `Registration`.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
