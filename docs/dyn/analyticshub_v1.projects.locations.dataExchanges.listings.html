Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;auditConfigs&quot;: [ # Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    { # Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs: { &quot;audit_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;allServices&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:jose@example.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;ADMIN_READ&quot; } ] }, { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;sampleservice.googleapis.com&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:aliya@example.com&quot; ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.
      &quot;auditLogConfigs&quot;: [ # The configuration for logging of each type of permission.

Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`. The size of the policy is limited to a few 10s of KB. An empty policy is a valid policy but certain Google Cloud services (such as Projects) might reject them.

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;auditConfigs&quot;: [ # Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="subscribe">subscribe(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Subscribes to a listing. Currently, with Analytics Hub, you can create listings that reference only BigQuery datasets. Upon subscription to a listing for a BigQuery dataset, Analytics Hub creates a linked dataset in the subscriber&#x27;s project.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Resource name of the listing that you want to subscribe to. e.g. `projects/myproject/locations/US/dataExchanges/123/listings/456`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Message for subscribing to a listing.
  &quot;destinationDataset&quot;: { # Defines the destination bigquery dataset. # Input only. BigQuery destination dataset to create for the subscriber.
    &quot;datasetReference&quot;: { # Contains the reference that identifies a destination bigquery dataset. # Required. A reference that identifies the destination dataset.
      &quot;datasetId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique ID for this dataset, without the project name. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 1,024 characters.
      &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The ID of the project containing this dataset.
    },
    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A user-friendly description of the dataset.
    &quot;friendlyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A descriptive name for the dataset.
    &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. The labels associated with this dataset. You can use these to organize and group your datasets. You can set this property when inserting or updating a dataset. See https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels for more information.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
    &quot;location&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The geographic location where the dataset should reside. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations for supported locations.
  },
  &quot;destinationPubsubSubscription&quot;: { # Defines the destination Pub/Sub subscription. # Required. Input only. Destination Pub/Sub subscription to create for the subscriber.
    &quot;pubsubSubscription&quot;: { # A subscription resource. If none of `push_config`, `bigquery_config`, or `cloud_storage_config` is set, then the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods. At most one of these fields may be set. # Required. Destination Pub/Sub subscription resource.
      &quot;ackDeadlineSeconds&quot;: 42, # Optional. The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be _outstanding_. During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.
      &quot;analyticsHubSubscriptionInfo&quot;: { # Information about an associated Analytics Hub subscription (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-manage-subscriptions). # Output only.

The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of NACKs and number of times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message). A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines. This field will be honored on a best effort basis. If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.
      },
      &quot;detached&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic. Detached subscriptions don&#x27;t receive messages from their topic and don&#x27;t retain any backlog. `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION.

A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription. If `expiration_policy` is not set, a *default policy* with `ttl` of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for `expiration_policy.ttl` is 1 day. If `expiration_policy` is set, but `expiration_policy.ttl` is not set, the subscription never expires.
        &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies the &quot;time-to-live&quot; duration for an associated resource. The resource expires if it is not active for a period of `ttl`. The definition of &quot;activity&quot; depends on the type of the associated resource. The minimum and maximum allowed values for `ttl` depend on the type of the associated resource, as well. If `ttl` is not set, the associated resource never expires.

The only currently supported attribute is `x-goog-version`, which you can use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata). If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription` calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute. The only supported values for the `x-goog-version` attribute are: * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API. For example: `attributes { &quot;x-goog-version&quot;: &quot;v1&quot; }`

          &quot;writeMetadata&quot;: True or False, # Optional. When true, writes the Pub/Sub message metadata to `x-goog-pubsub-:` headers of the HTTP request. Writes the Pub/Sub message attributes to `:` headers of the HTTP request.
        },
        &quot;oidcToken&quot;: { # Contains information needed for generating an [OpenID Connect token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect). # Optional. If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as an `Authorization` header in the HTTP request for every pushed message.
          &quot;audience&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience value is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple values (array) for the audience field is not supported. More info about the OIDC JWT token audience here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3 Note: if not specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used.
          &quot;serviceAccountEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. [Service account email](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) used for generating the OIDC token. For more information on setting up authentication, see [Push subscriptions](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/push).

      },
      &quot;retainAckedMessages&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription&#x27;s backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the `message_retention_duration` window. This must be true if you would like to [`Seek` to a timestamp] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time) in the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.
      &quot;retryPolicy&quot;: { # A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery. Retry delay will be exponential based on provided minimum and maximum backoffs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message. Retry Policy is implemented on a best effort basis. At times, the delay between consecutive deliveries may not match the configuration. That is, delay can be more or less than configured backoff. # Optional. A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message.
        &quot;maximumBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
        &quot;minimumBackoff&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
      },
      &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. An output-only field indicating whether or not the subscription can receive messages.
      &quot;topicMessageRetentionDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a message is retained after it is published to the subscription&#x27;s topic. If this field is set, messages published to the subscription&#x27;s topic in the last `topic_message_retention_duration` are always available to subscribers. See the `message_retention_duration` field in `Topic`. This field is set only in responses from the server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.
