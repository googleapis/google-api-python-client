  <pre>Performs asynchronous video annotation. Progress and results can be
retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface.
`Operation.metadata` contains `AnnotateVideoProgress` (progress).
`Operation.response` contains `AnnotateVideoResponse` (results).

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Video annotation request.
    "videoContext": { # Video context and/or feature-specific parameters. # Additional video context and/or feature-specific parameters.

      "segments": [ # Video segments to annotate. The segments may overlap and are not required
          # to be contiguous or span the whole video. If unspecified, each video
          # is treated as a single segment.

      ],
      "labelDetectionMode": "A String", # If label detection has been requested, what labels should be detected
          # in addition to video-level labels or segment-level labels. If unspecified,
          # defaults to `SHOT_MODE`.
    },
    "features": [ # Requested video annotation features.
      "A String",
    ],
    "inputContent": "A String", # The video data bytes. Encoding: base64. If unset, the input video(s)

        # A video URI may include wildcards in `object-id`, and thus identify
        # multiple videos. Supported wildcards: '*' to match 0 or more characters;
        # '?' to match 1 character. If unset, the input video should be embedded
        # in the request as `input_content`. If set, `input_content` should be unset.
    "locationId": "A String", # Optional cloud region where annotation should take place. Supported cloud
        # regions: `us-east1`, `us-west1`, `europe-west1`, `asia-east1`. If no region
        # is specified, a region will be determined based on video file location.
    "outputUri": "A String", # Optional location where the output (in JSON format) should be stored.
        # Currently, only [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
        # URIs are supported, which must be specified in the following format:
        # `gs://bucket-id/object-id` (other URI formats return

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
        # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There will be a
          # common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {
          "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If true, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should have the format of `operations/some/unique/name`.
