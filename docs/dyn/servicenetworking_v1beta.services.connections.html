  <pre>Creates a private connection that establishes a VPC Network Peering connection to a VPC network in the service producer&#x27;s organization. The administrator of the service consumer&#x27;s VPC network invokes this method. The administrator must assign one or more allocated IP ranges for provisioning subnetworks in the service producer&#x27;s VPC network. This connection is used for all supported services in the service producer&#x27;s organization, so it only needs to be invoked once. The response from the `get` operation will be of type `Connection` if the operation successfully completes.

Args:
  parent: string, The service that is managing peering connectivity for a service producer&#x27;s organization. For Google services that support this functionality, this value is `services/servicenetworking.googleapis.com`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a private connection resource. A private connection is implemented as a VPC Network Peering connection between a service producer&#x27;s VPC network and a service consumer&#x27;s VPC network.
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of service consumer&#x27;s VPC network that&#x27;s connected with service producer network, in the following format: `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`. `{project}` is a project number, such as in `12345` that includes the VPC service consumer&#x27;s VPC network. `{network}` is the name of the service consumer&#x27;s VPC network.
  &quot;peering&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the VPC Network Peering connection that was created by the service producer.
  &quot;reservedPeeringRanges&quot;: [ # The name of one or more allocated IP address ranges for this service producer of type `PEERING`. Note that invoking this method with a different range when connection is already established will not modify already provisioned service producer subnetworks.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;service&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the peering service that&#x27;s associated with this connection, in the following format: `services/{service name}`.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
