Results could still be shown even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your heavily favored but irrelevant documents. Setting to -1.0 gives the document a big demotion.

Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored. Only one of the (condition, boost) combination or the boost_control_spec below are set.

For example, `why is the sky blue` and `Who is the best soccer player in the world?` are summary-seeking queries, but `SFO airport` and `world cup 2026` are not. They are most likely navigational queries. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating summaries for non-summary seeking queries and return fallback messages instead.

If set to false, the position of this facet in the response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before the facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets. For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it&#x27;s not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response is determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * &quot;rating&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = true * &quot;price&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false * &quot;brands&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of the facets in the response can be (&quot;price&quot;, &quot;brands&quot;, &quot;rating&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;) or (&quot;price&quot;, &quot;brands&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;rating&quot;) depends on how API orders &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;rating&quot; facets. However, notice that &quot;price&quot; and &quot;brands&quot; are always ranked at first and second position because their enable_dynamic_position is false.

For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet &quot;Red&quot; and 200 documents with the color facet &quot;Blue&quot;. A query containing the filter &quot;color:ANY(&quot;Red&quot;)&quot; and having &quot;color&quot; as FacetKey.key would by default return only &quot;Red&quot; documents in the search results, and also return &quot;Red&quot; with count 100 as the only color facet. Although there are also blue documents available, &quot;Blue&quot; would not be shown as an available facet value. If &quot;color&quot; is listed in &quot;excludedFilterKeys&quot;, then the query returns the facet values &quot;Red&quot; with count 100 and &quot;Blue&quot; with count 200, because the &quot;color&quot; key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field doesn&#x27;t affect search results, the search results are still correctly filtered to return only &quot;Red&quot; documents. A maximum of 100 values are allowed. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.

Session allows users to do multi-turn /search API calls or coordination between /search API calls and /answer API calls. Example #1 (multi-turn /search API calls): 1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below). 2. Call /search API with the session ID generated in the first call. Here, the previous search query gets considered in query standing. I.e., if the first query is &quot;How did Alphabet do in 2022?&quot; and the current query is &quot;How about 2023?&quot;, the current query will be interpreted as &quot;How did Alphabet do in 2023?&quot;. Example #2 (coordination between /search API calls and /answer API calls): 1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below). 2. Call /answer API with the session ID generated in the first call. Here, the answer generation happens in the context of the search results from the first search call. Auto-session mode: when `projects/.../sessions/-` is used, a new session gets automatically created. Otherwise, users can use the create-session API to create a session manually.

However, results that are deeply relevant might still be shown. The document will have an upstream battle to get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely. Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored. Only one of the (condition, boost) combination or the boost_control_spec below are set. If both are set then the global boost is ignored and the more fine-grained boost_control_spec is applied.

For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it&#x27;s not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response is determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * &quot;rating&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = true * &quot;price&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false * &quot;brands&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enabled, which generates a facet `gender`.

This field is used to identify the serving configuration name, set of models used to make the search.
      &quot;session&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The session resource name. Optional. Session allows users to do multi-turn /search API calls or coordination between /search API calls and /answer API calls. Example #1 (multi-turn /search API calls): 1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below). 2. Call /search API with the session ID generated in the first call. Here, the previous search query gets considered in query standing. I.e., if the first query is &quot;How did Alphabet do in 2022?&quot; and the current query is &quot;How about 2023?&quot;, the current query will be interpreted as &quot;How did Alphabet do in 2023?&quot;. Example #2 (coordination between /search API calls and /answer API calls): 1. Call /search API with the auto-session mode (see below). 2. Call /answer API with the session ID generated in the first call. Here, the answer generation happens in the context of the search results from the first search call. Auto-session mode: when `projects/.../sessions/-` is used, a new session gets automatically created. Otherwise, users can use the create-session API to create a session manually. Multi-turn Search feature is currently at private GA stage. Please use v1alpha or v1beta version instead before we launch this feature to public GA. Or ask for allowlisting through Google Support team.
      &quot;sessionSpec&quot;: { # Session specification. Multi-turn Search feature is currently at private GA stage. Please use v1alpha or v1beta version instead before we launch this feature to public GA. Or ask for allowlisting through Google Support team. # Session specification.

The stored search result can be used by a subsequent /answer API call (with the session ID and the query ID specified). Also, it is possible to call /search and /answer in parallel with the same session ID &amp; query ID.
        &quot;searchResultPersistenceCount&quot;: 42, # The number of top search results to persist. The persisted search results can be used for the subsequent /answer api call.

Always use a hashed value for this ID. Don&#x27;t set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a list of Evaluations.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent location resource name, such as `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. If the caller does not have permission to list Evaluations under this location, regardless of whether or not this location exists, a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error is returned. (required)

For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it&#x27;s not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response is determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * &quot;rating&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = true * &quot;price&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false * &quot;brands&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of the facets in the response can be (&quot;price&quot;, &quot;brands&quot;, &quot;rating&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;) or (&quot;price&quot;, &quot;brands&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;rating&quot;) depends on how API orders &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;rating&quot; facets.

Although there are also blue documents available, &quot;Blue&quot; would not be shown as an available facet value. If &quot;color&quot; is listed in &quot;excludedFilterKeys&quot;, then the query returns the facet values &quot;Red&quot; with count 100 and &quot;Blue&quot; with count 200, because the &quot;color&quot; key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field doesn&#x27;t affect search results, the search results are still correctly filtered to return only &quot;Red&quot; documents. A maximum of 100 values are allowed.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="listResults">listResults(evaluation, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a list of results for a given a Evaluation.

Args:
  evaluation: string, Required. The evaluation resource name, such as `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/evaluations/{evaluation}`. If the caller does not have permission to list EvaluationResult under this evaluation, regardless of whether or not this evaluation set exists, a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error is returned. (required)
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of EvaluationResult to return. If unspecified, defaults to 100. The maximum allowed value is 1000. Values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000. If this field is negative, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
  pageToken: string, A page token ListEvaluationResultsResponse.next_page_token, received from a previous EvaluationService.ListEvaluationResults call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to EvaluationService.ListEvaluationResults must match the call that provided the page token. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
