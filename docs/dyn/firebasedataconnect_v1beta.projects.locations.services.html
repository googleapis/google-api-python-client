  <pre>Creates a new Service in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Value of parent. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Firebase Data Connect service.
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Optional. Stores small amounts of arbitrary data.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Create time stamp.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Mutable human-readable name. 63 character limit.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. [AIP-154](https://google.aip.dev/154)
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels as key value pairs.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The relative resource name of the Firebase Data Connect service, in the format: ``` projects/{project}/locations/{location}/services/{service} ``` Note that the service ID is specific to Firebase Data Connect and does not correspond to any of the instance IDs of the underlying data source connections.
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. A field that if true, indicates that the system is working update the service.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. System-assigned, unique identifier.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Update time stamp.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  serviceId: string, Required. The ID to use for the service, which will become the final component of the service&#x27;s resource name.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, validate the request and preview the Service, but do not actually create it.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

  force: boolean, Optional. If set to true, any child resources (i.e. Schema, SchemaRevisions, Connectors, and ConnectorRevisions) will also be deleted. Otherwise, the request will only work if the Service has no child resources.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
        </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, allowMissing=None, body=None, requestId=None, updateMask=None, validateOnly=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the parameters of a single Service.

Args:
  name: string, Identifier. The relative resource name of the Firebase Data Connect service, in the format: ``` projects/{project}/locations/{location}/services/{service} ``` Note that the service ID is specific to Firebase Data Connect and does not correspond to any of the instance IDs of the underlying data source connections. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Firebase Data Connect service.
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Optional. Stores small amounts of arbitrary data.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Create time stamp.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Mutable human-readable name. 63 character limit.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. [AIP-154](https://google.aip.dev/154)
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels as key value pairs.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The relative resource name of the Firebase Data Connect service, in the format: ``` projects/{project}/locations/{location}/services/{service} ``` Note that the service ID is specific to Firebase Data Connect and does not correspond to any of the instance IDs of the underlying data source connections.
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. A field that if true, indicates that the system is working update the service.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. System-assigned, unique identifier.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Update time stamp.
}

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If true and the Service is not found, a new Service will be created. In this case, `update_mask` is ignored.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Service resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, validate the request and preview the Service, but do not actually update it.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
