  <pre>Requests the creation of a new AndroidApp in the specified FirebaseProject. The result of this call is an `Operation` which can be used to track the provisioning process. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call `DeleteOperation`.

Args:
  parent: string, The resource name of the parent FirebaseProject in which to create an AndroidApp, in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER/androidApps Refer to the `FirebaseProject` [`name`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.name) field for details about PROJECT_IDENTIFIER values. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Details of a Firebase App for Android.
  &quot;apiKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The globally unique, Google-assigned identifier (UID) for the Firebase API key associated with the `AndroidApp`. Be aware that this value is the UID of the API key, _not_ the [`keyString`](https://cloud.google.com/api-keys/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.keys#Key.FIELDS.key_string) of the API key. The `keyString` is the value that can be found in the App&#x27;s [configuration artifact](../../rest/v1beta1/projects.androidApps/getConfig). If `api_key_id` is not set in requests to [`androidApps.Create`](../../rest/v1beta1/projects.androidApps/create), then Firebase automatically associates an `api_key_id` with the `AndroidApp`. This auto-associated key may be an existing valid key or, if no valid key exists, a new one will be provisioned. In patch requests, `api_key_id` cannot be set to an empty value, and the new UID must have no restrictions or only have restrictions that are valid for the associated `AndroidApp`. We recommend using the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) to manage API keys.
  &quot;appId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. The globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `AndroidApp`. This identifier should be treated as an opaque token, as the data format is not specified.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and it may be sent with update requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. Learn more about `etag` in Google&#x27;s [AIP-154 standard](https://google.aip.dev/154#declarative-friendly-resources). This etag is strongly validated.
  &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp of when the App will be considered expired and cannot be undeleted. This value is only provided if the App is in the `DELETED` state.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the AndroidApp, in the format: projects/ PROJECT_IDENTIFIER/androidApps/APP_ID * PROJECT_IDENTIFIER: the parent Project&#x27;s [`ProjectNumber`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_number) ***(recommended)*** or its [`ProjectId`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_id). Learn more about using project identifiers in Google&#x27;s [AIP 2510 standard](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510). Note that the value for PROJECT_IDENTIFIER in any response body will be the `ProjectId`. * APP_ID: the globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the App (see [`appId`](../projects.androidApps#AndroidApp.FIELDS.app_id)).

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

We recommend using the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) to manage API keys.
  &quot;appId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. The globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `AndroidApp`. This identifier should be treated as an opaque token, as the data format is not specified.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The user-assigned display name for the `AndroidApp`.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and it may be sent with update requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. Learn more about `etag` in Google&#x27;s [AIP-154 standard](https://google.aip.dev/154#declarative-friendly-resources). This etag is strongly validated.
  &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp of when the App will be considered expired and cannot be undeleted. This value is only provided if the App is in the `DELETED` state.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the AndroidApp, in the format: projects/ PROJECT_IDENTIFIER/androidApps/APP_ID * PROJECT_IDENTIFIER: the parent Project&#x27;s [`ProjectNumber`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_number) ***(recommended)*** or its [`ProjectId`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_id). Learn more about using project identifiers in Google&#x27;s [AIP 2510 standard](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510). Note that the value for PROJECT_IDENTIFIER in any response body will be the `ProjectId`. * APP_ID: the globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the App (see [`appId`](../projects.androidApps#AndroidApp.FIELDS.app_id)).
  &quot;packageName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The canonical package name of the Android app as would appear in the Google Play Developer Console.
  &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. A user-assigned unique identifier of the parent FirebaseProject for the `AndroidApp`.
  &quot;sha1Hashes&quot;: [ # The SHA1 certificate hashes for the AndroidApp.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;sha256Hashes&quot;: [ # The SHA256 certificate hashes for the AndroidApp.
    &quot;A String&quot;,

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="remove">remove(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Removes the specified AndroidApp from the FirebaseProject.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the AndroidApp, in the format: projects/ PROJECT_IDENTIFIER/androidApps/APP_ID Since an APP_ID is a unique identifier, the Unique Resource from Sub-Collection access pattern may be used here, in the format: projects/-/androidApps/APP_ID Refer to the AndroidApp [name](../projects.androidApps#AndroidApp.FIELDS.name) field for details about PROJECT_IDENTIFIER and APP_ID values. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;allowMissing&quot;: True or False, # If set to true, and the App is not found, the request will succeed but no action will be taken on the server.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Checksum provided in the AndroidApp resource. If provided, this checksum ensures that the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;immediate&quot;: True or False, # Determines whether to _immediately_ delete the AndroidApp. If set to true, the App is immediately deleted from the Project and cannot be restored to the Project. If not set, defaults to false, which means the App will be set to expire in 30 days. Within the 30 days, the App may be restored to the Project using UndeleteAndroidApp.
  &quot;validateOnly&quot;: True or False, # If set to true, the request is only validated. The App will _not_ be removed.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
