  <pre>CreateObservationJob creates a new ObservationJob but does not have any effecton its own. It is a configuration that can be used in an Observation Job to collect data about existing APIs.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource where this ObservationJob will be created. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Message describing ObservationJob object
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Create time stamp
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. name of resource Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/observationJobs/{observation_job}
  &quot;sources&quot;: [ # Optional. These should be of the same kind of source.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The observation job state
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Update time stamp
}

  observationJobId: string, Required. The ID to use for the Observation Job. This value should be 4-63 characters, and valid characters are /a-z-/.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
