  <pre>Creates a new service configuration (version) for a managed service.
This method only stores the service configuration. To roll out the service
configuration to backend systems please call
CreateServiceRollout.

Only the 100 most recent service configurations and ones referenced by
existing rollouts are kept for each service. The rest will be deleted
eventually.

Args:
  serviceName: string, The name of the service.  See the [overview](/service-management/overview)
for naming requirements.  For example: `example.googleapis.com`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # `Service` is the root object of Google service configuration schema. It
    # describes basic information about a service, such as the name and the
    # title, and delegates other aspects to sub-sections. Each sub-section is
    # either a proto message or a repeated proto message that configures a
    # specific aspect, such as auth. See each proto message definition for details.

          #
          # gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or
          # more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service
          # that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google
          # APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
          # [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
          # Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),
          # and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
          # and use it for large scale production services.
          #
          # `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies
          # how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
          # path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
          # gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
          # typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.
          #
          # Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
          # template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long
          # as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
          # The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
          # the URL path.
          #
          # Example:
          #
          #     service Messaging {
          #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
          #         option (google.api.http) = {
          #             get: "/v1/{name=messages/*}"
          #         };
          #       }
          #     }
          #     message GetMessageRequest {
          #       string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
          #     }
          #     message Message {
          #       string text = 1; // The resource content.
          #     }
          #
          # This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:
          #
          # HTTP | gRPC
          # -----|-----
          # `GET /v1/messages/123456`  | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")`
          #
          # Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
          # automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
          # For example:
          #
          #     service Messaging {
          #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
          #         option (google.api.http) = {
          #             get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}"
          #         };
          #       }
          #     }
          #     message GetMessageRequest {
          #       message SubMessage {
          #         string subfield = 1;
          #       }
          #       string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
          #       int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.
          #       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.
          #     }
          #
          # This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:
          #
          # HTTP | gRPC
          # -----|-----
          # `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` |
          # `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield:
          # "foo"))`
          #
          # Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
          # primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
          # In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
          # as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
          # message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
          # `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.
          #
          # For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field
          # specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
          # message resource collection:
          #
          #     service Messaging {
          #       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
          #         option (google.api.http) = {
          #           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
          #           body: "message"
          #         };
          #       }
          #     }
          #     message UpdateMessageRequest {
          #       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
          #       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
          #     }
          #
          # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
          # representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
          # protos JSON encoding:
          #
          # HTTP | gRPC
          # -----|-----
          # `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
          # "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`
          #
          # The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
          # every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
          # request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
          # the update method:
          #
          #     service Messaging {
          #       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
          #         option (google.api.http) = {
          #           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
          #           body: "*"
          #         };
          #       }
          #     }
          #     message Message {
          #       string message_id = 1;
          #       string text = 2;
          #     }
          #
          #
          # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
          #
          # HTTP | gRPC
          # -----|-----
          # `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
          # "123456" text: "Hi!")`
          #
          # Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
          # have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
          # the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
          # defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
          # which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
          #
          # It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
          # the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
          #
          #     service Messaging {
          #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
          #         option (google.api.http) = {
          #           get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
          #           additional_bindings {
          #             get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
          #           }
          #         };
          #       }
          #     }
          #     message GetMessageRequest {
          #       string message_id = 1;
          #       string user_id = 2;
          #     }
          #
          # This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:
          #
          # HTTP | gRPC
          # -----|-----
          # `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
          # `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:
          # "123456")`
          #
          # ## Rules for HTTP mapping
          #
          # 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
          #    message) are classified into three categories:
          #    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
          #    - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP
          #      request body.
          #    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
          #      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
          #      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
          #      name.
          #  2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all fields
          #     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
          #  3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all
          #     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.
          #
          # ### Path template syntax
          #
          #     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
          #     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
          #     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
          #     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
          #     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
          #     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
          #
          # The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches
          # zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
          # except the `Verb`.
          #
          # The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
          # template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
          # matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
          # is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
          #
          # The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
          # contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
          # before the matching.
          #
          # If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
          # `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
          # side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The
          # server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
          # [Discovery
          # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
          # `{var}`.
          #
          # If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/*}"`
          # or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
          # client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.
          # The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
          # unchanged. Such variables show up in the
          # [Discovery
          # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
          # `{+var}`.

          # for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
          # service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
          # proto message.
          #
          # As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
          # transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
          # `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
          # effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
          # have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
          # specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
          # configuration in the proto.
          #
          # Example:
          #
          #     http:
          #       rules:
          #         # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.
          #         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
          #           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
          #
          # ## Special notes
          #
          # When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
          # proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
          # specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
          #
          # While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
          # [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
          # Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
          # 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
          # does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
          # to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
          # for multi segment variables.
          #
          # The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
          # because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.
          #
          # The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason
          # is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
          # character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
          #
          # Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
          # no client library can support such complicated mapping.
          #
          # If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map

            #
            # gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or
            # more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service
            # that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google
            # APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
            # [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
            # Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),
            # and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
            # and use it for large scale production services.
            #
            # `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies
            # how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
            # path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
            # gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
            # typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.
            #
            # Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
            # template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long
            # as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
            # The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
            # the URL path.
            #
            # Example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #             get: "/v1/{name=messages/*}"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message GetMessageRequest {
            #       string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
            #     }
            #     message Message {
            #       string text = 1; // The resource content.
            #     }
            #
            # This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456`  | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")`
            #
            # Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
            # automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
            # For example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #             get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message GetMessageRequest {
            #       message SubMessage {
            #         string subfield = 1;
            #       }
            #       string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
            #       int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.
            #       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.
            #     }
            #
            # This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` |
            # `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield:
            # "foo"))`
            #
            # Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
            # primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
            # In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
            # as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
            # message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
            # `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.
            #
            # For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field
            # specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
            # message resource collection:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           body: "message"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message UpdateMessageRequest {
            #       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
            #       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
            #     }
            #
            # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
            # representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
            # protos JSON encoding:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
            # "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`
            #
            # The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
            # every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
            # request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
            # the update method:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           body: "*"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message Message {
            #       string message_id = 1;
            #       string text = 2;
            #     }
            #
            #
            # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
            # "123456" text: "Hi!")`
            #
            # Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
            # have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
            # the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
            # defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
            # which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
            #
            # It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
            # the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           additional_bindings {
            #             get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
            #           }
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message GetMessageRequest {
            #       string message_id = 1;
            #       string user_id = 2;
            #     }
            #
            # This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
            # `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:
            # "123456")`
            #
            # ## Rules for HTTP mapping
            #
            # 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
            #    message) are classified into three categories:
            #    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
            #    - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP
            #      request body.
            #    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
            #      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
            #      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
            #      name.
            #  2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all fields
            #     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
            #  3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all
            #     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.
            #
            # ### Path template syntax
            #
            #     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
            #     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
            #     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
            #     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
            #     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
            #     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
            #
            # The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches
            # zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
            # except the `Verb`.
            #
            # The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
            # template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
            # matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
            # is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
            #
            # The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
            # contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
            # before the matching.
            #
            # If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
            # `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
            # side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The
            # server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
            # [Discovery
            # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
            # `{var}`.
            #
            # If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/*}"`
            # or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
            # client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.
            # The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
            # unchanged. Such variables show up in the
            # [Discovery
            # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
            # `{+var}`.
            #
            # ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration
            #
            # gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
            # for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
            # service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
            # proto message.
            #
            # As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
            # transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
            # `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
            # effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
            # have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
            # specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
            # configuration in the proto.
            #
            # Example:
            #
            #     http:
            #       rules:
            #         # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.
            #         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
            #           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
            #
            # ## Special notes
            #
            # When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
            # proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
            # specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
            #
            # While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
            # [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
            # Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
            # 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
            # does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
            # to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
            # for multi segment variables.
            #
            # The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
            # because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.
            #
            # The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason
            # is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
            # character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
            #
            # Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
            # no client library can support such complicated mapping.
            #
            # If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map

            #
            # gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or
            # more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service
            # that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google
            # APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
            # [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
            # Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),
            # and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
            # and use it for large scale production services.
            #
            # `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies
            # how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
            # path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
            # gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
            # typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.
            #
            # Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
            # template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long
            # as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
            # The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
            # the URL path.
            #
            # Example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #             get: "/v1/{name=messages/*}"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message GetMessageRequest {
            #       string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
            #     }
            #     message Message {
            #       string text = 1; // The resource content.
            #     }
            #
            # This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456`  | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")`
            #
            # Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
            # automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
            # For example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #             get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message GetMessageRequest {
            #       message SubMessage {
            #         string subfield = 1;
            #       }
            #       string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
            #       int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.
            #       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.
            #     }
            #
            # This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` |
            # `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield:
            # "foo"))`
            #
            # Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
            # primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
            # In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
            # as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
            # message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
            # `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.
            #
            # For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field
            # specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
            # message resource collection:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           body: "message"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message UpdateMessageRequest {
            #       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
            #       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
            #     }
            #
            # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
            # representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
            # protos JSON encoding:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
            # "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`
            #
            # The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
            # every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
            # request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
            # the update method:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           body: "*"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message Message {
            #       string message_id = 1;
            #       string text = 2;
            #     }
            #
            #
            # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
            # "123456" text: "Hi!")`
            #
            # Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
            # have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
            # the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
            # defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
            # which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
            #
            # It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
            # the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           additional_bindings {
            #             get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
            #           }
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message GetMessageRequest {
            #       string message_id = 1;
            #       string user_id = 2;
            #     }
            #
            # This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
            # `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:
            # "123456")`
            #
            # ## Rules for HTTP mapping
            #
            # 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
            #    message) are classified into three categories:
            #    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
            #    - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP
            #      request body.
            #    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
            #      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
            #      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
            #      name.
            #  2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all fields
            #     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
            #  3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all
            #     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.
            #
            # ### Path template syntax
            #
            #     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
            #     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
            #     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
            #     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
            #     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
            #     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
            #
            # The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches
            # zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
            # except the `Verb`.
            #
            # The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
            # template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
            # matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
            # is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
            #
            # The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
            # contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
            # before the matching.
            #
            # If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
            # `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
            # side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The
            # server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
            # [Discovery
            # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
            # `{var}`.
            #
            # If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/*}"`
            # or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
            # client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.
            # The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
            # unchanged. Such variables show up in the
            # [Discovery
            # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
            # `{+var}`.
            #
            # ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration
            #
            # gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
            # for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
            # service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
            # proto message.
            #
            # As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
            # transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
            # `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
            # effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
            # have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
            # specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
            # configuration in the proto.
            #
            # Example:
            #
            #     http:
            #       rules:
            #         # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.
            #         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
            #           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
            #
            # ## Special notes
            #
            # When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
            # proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
            # specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
            #
            # While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
            # [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
            # Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
            # 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
            # does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
            # to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
            # for multi segment variables.
            #
            # The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
            # because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.
            #
            # The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason
            # is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
            # character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
            #
            # Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
            # no client library can support such complicated mapping.
            #
            # If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map
            # the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC

            # Notes:
            #
            # * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT` and is
            #    equivalent to `1` if it is used alone. For examples,
            #    `{requests}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`.
            # * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not
            #    containing '{' or '}'.
            # * `1` represents dimensionless value 1, such as in `1/s`.

            #    a percentage.

                # gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or

                # APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
                # [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC

                # and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
                # and use it for large scale production services.
                #
                # `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies
                # how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
                # path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
                # gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
                # typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.
                #
                # Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
                # template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long
                # as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
                # The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
                # the URL path.
                #
                # Example:
                #
                #     service Messaging {

                #     }
                #
                # This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:

                # Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template

                #
                # Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
                # primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
                # In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
                # as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
                # message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
                # `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.
                #
                # For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field

                #
                # Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
                # have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
                # the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
                # defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
                # which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
                #
                # It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
                # the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
                #
                #     service Messaging {
                #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
                #         option (google.api.http) = {
                #           get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
                #           additional_bindings {
                #             get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
                #           }
                #         };
                #       }
                #     }
                #     message GetMessageRequest {
                #       string message_id = 1;
                #       string user_id = 2;
                #     }
                #
                # This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:
                #
                # HTTP | gRPC
                # -----|-----
                # `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
                # `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:
                # "123456")`
                #
                # ## Rules for HTTP mapping
                #
                # 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
                #    message) are classified into three categories:
                #    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
                #    - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP
                #      request body.
                #    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
                #      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
                #      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
                #      name.
                #  2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all fields
                #     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
                #  3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all
                #     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.
                #
                # ### Path template syntax
                #
                #     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
                #     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;

                # ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration
                #
                # gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
                # for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
                # service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
                # proto message.
                #
                # As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
                # transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
                # `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
                # effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
                # have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
                # specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
                # configuration in the proto.
                #
                # Example:
                #
                #     http:
                #       rules:
                #         # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.
                #         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
                #           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
                #
                # ## Special notes
                #
                # When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
                # proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
                # specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
                #
                # While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
                # [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
                # Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
                # 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
                # does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
                # to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
                # for multi segment variables.
                #
                # The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
                # because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.
                #
                # The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason
                # is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
                # character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
                #
                # Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
                # no client library can support such complicated mapping.
                #
                # If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map
                # the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC

  <pre>Creates a new service configuration (version) for a managed service based
on
user-supplied configuration source files (for example: OpenAPI
Specification). This method stores the source configurations as well as the
generated service configuration. To rollout the service configuration to
other services,
please call CreateServiceRollout.

Only the 100 most recent configuration sources and ones referenced by
existing service configurtions are kept for each service. The rest will be
deleted eventually.
