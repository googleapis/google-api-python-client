      &quot;userRatingCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. The total number of reviews (with or without text) for this place.
      &quot;utcOffsetMinutes&quot;: 42, # Output only. Number of minutes this place&#x27;s timezone is currently offset from UTC. This is expressed in minutes to support timezones that are offset by fractions of an hour, e.g. X hours and 15 minutes.
      &quot;viewport&quot;: { # A latitude-longitude viewport, represented as two diagonally opposite `low` and `high` points. A viewport is considered a closed region, i.e. it includes its boundary. The latitude bounds must range between -90 to 90 degrees inclusive, and the longitude bounds must range between -180 to 180 degrees inclusive. Various cases include: - If `low` = `high`, the viewport consists of that single point. - If `low.longitude` &gt; `high.longitude`, the longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses the 180 degree longitude line). - If `low.longitude` = -180 degrees and `high.longitude` = 180 degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes. - If `low.longitude` = 180 degrees and `high.longitude` = -180 degrees, the longitude range is empty. - If `low.latitude` &gt; `high.latitude`, the latitude range is empty. Both `low` and `high` must be populated, and the represented box cannot be empty (as specified by the definitions above). An empty viewport will result in an error. For example, this viewport fully encloses New York City: { &quot;low&quot;: { &quot;latitude&quot;: 40.477398, &quot;longitude&quot;: -74.259087 }, &quot;high&quot;: { &quot;latitude&quot;: 40.91618, &quot;longitude&quot;: -73.70018 } } # Output only. A viewport suitable for displaying the place on an average-sized map.
        &quot;high&quot;: { # An object that represents a latitude/longitude pair. This is expressed as a pair of doubles to represent degrees latitude and degrees longitude. Unless specified otherwise, this object must conform to the WGS84 standard. Values must be within normalized ranges. # Required. The high point of the viewport.
          &quot;latitude&quot;: 3.14, # The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].
          &quot;longitude&quot;: 3.14, # The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].
        },
        &quot;low&quot;: { # An object that represents a latitude/longitude pair. This is expressed as a pair of doubles to represent degrees latitude and degrees longitude. Unless specified otherwise, this object must conform to the WGS84 standard. Values must be within normalized ranges. # Required. The low point of the viewport.
          &quot;latitude&quot;: 3.14, # The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].
          &quot;longitude&quot;: 3.14, # The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].

      &quot;websiteUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The authoritative website for this place, e.g. a business&#x27; homepage. Note that for places that are part of a chain (e.g. an IKEA store), this will usually be the website for the individual store, not the overall chain.
      &quot;wheelchairAccessibleEntrance&quot;: True or False, # Output only. [Deprecated!] Specifies if the place has an entrance that is wheelchair-accessible.
