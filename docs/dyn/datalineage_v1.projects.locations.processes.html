<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new process.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project and its location that should own the process. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A process is the definition of a data transformation operation.
  &quot;attributes&quot;: { # Optional. The attributes of the process. Should only be used for the purpose of non-semantic management (classifying, describing or labeling the process). Up to 100 attributes are allowed.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  },
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A human-readable name you can set to display in a user interface. Must be not longer than 200 characters and only contain UTF-8 letters or numbers, spaces or characters like `_-:&amp;.`
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The resource name of the lineage process. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/processes/{process}`. Can be specified or auto-assigned. {process} must be not longer than 200 characters and only contain characters in a set: `a-zA-Z0-9_-:.`
  &quot;origin&quot;: { # Origin of a process. # Optional. The origin of this process and its runs and lineage events.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If the source_type isn&#x27;t CUSTOM, the value of this field should be a GCP resource name of the system, which reports lineage.

Examples: - `{source_type: COMPOSER, name: &quot;projects/foo/locations/us/environments/bar&quot;}` - `{source_type: BIGQUERY, name: &quot;projects/foo/locations/eu&quot;}` - `{source_type: CUSTOM, name: &quot;myCustomIntegration&quot;}`
    &quot;sourceType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Type of the source. Use of a source_type other than `CUSTOM` for process creation or updating is highly discouraged. It might be restricted in the future without notice. There will be increase in cost if you use any of the source types other than `CUSTOM`.
  },
}

  requestId: string, A unique identifier for this request. Restricted to 36 ASCII characters. A random UUID is recommended. This request is idempotent only if a `request_id` is provided.

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
