  <pre>Returns all repos belonging to a project. The sizes of the repos are
not set by ListRepos.  To get the size of a repo, use GetRepo.

Args:
  name: string, The project ID whose repos should be listed. Values are of the form
`projects/<project>`. (required)
  pageToken: string, Resume listing repositories where a prior ListReposResponse
left off. This is an opaque token that must be obtained from
a recent, prior ListReposResponse's next_page_token field.

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of repositories to return; between 1 and 500.
If not set or zero, defaults to 100 at the server.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
