  <pre>Get the OS policy asssignment report for the specified Compute Engine VM instance.

Args:
  name: string, Required. API resource name for OS policy assignment report. Format: `/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}/osPolicyAssignments/{assignment}/report` For `{project}`, either `project-number` or `project-id` can be provided. For `{instance_id}`, either Compute Engine `instance-id` or `instance-name` can be provided. For `{assignment_id}`, the OSPolicyAssignment id must be provided. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;lastRunId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Unique identifier of the last attempted run to apply the OS policies associated with this assignment on the VM. This ID is logged by the OS Config agent while applying the OS policies associated with this assignment on the VM. NOTE: If the service is unable to successfully connect to the agent for this run, then this id will not be available in the agent logs.

See `os_policy_resource_compliances` for details. * `task-timeout`: The task sent to the agent to apply the policy timed out. * `unexpected-agent-state`: The OS Config agent did not report the final status of the task that attempted to apply the policy. Instead, the agent unexpectedly started working on a different task. This mostly happens when the agent or VM unexpectedly restarts while applying OS policies. * `internal-service-errors`: Internal service errors were encountered while attempting to apply the policy.

  <pre>List OS policy asssignment reports for all Compute Engine VM instances in the specified zone.

Args:
