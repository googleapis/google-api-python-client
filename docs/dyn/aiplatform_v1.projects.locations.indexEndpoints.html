  <pre>Creates an IndexEndpoint.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the Location to create the IndexEndpoint in. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Indexes are deployed into it. An IndexEndpoint can have multiple DeployedIndexes.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when this IndexEndpoint was created.
  &quot;deployedIndexes&quot;: [ # Output only. The indexes deployed in this endpoint.
    { # A deployment of an Index. IndexEndpoints contain one or more DeployedIndexes.
      &quot;automaticResources&quot;: { # A description of resources that to large degree are decided by Vertex AI, and require only a modest additional configuration. Each Model supporting these resources documents its specific guidelines. # Optional. A description of resources that the DeployedIndex uses, which to large degree are decided by Vertex AI, and optionally allows only a modest additional configuration. If min_replica_count is not set, the default value is 2 (we don&#x27;t provide SLA when min_replica_count=1). If max_replica_count is not set, the default value is min_replica_count. The max allowed replica count is 1000.
        &quot;maxReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The maximum number of replicas this DeployedModel may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, a no upper bound for scaling under heavy traffic will be assume, though Vertex AI may be unable to scale beyond certain replica number.
        &quot;minReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The minimum number of replicas this DeployedModel will be always deployed on. If traffic against it increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas up to max_replica_count, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error.
      },
      &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the DeployedIndex was created.
      &quot;dedicatedResources&quot;: { # A description of resources that are dedicated to a DeployedModel, and that need a higher degree of manual configuration. # Optional. A description of resources that are dedicated to the DeployedIndex, and that need a higher degree of manual configuration. The field min_replica_count must be set to a value strictly greater than 0, or else validation will fail. We don&#x27;t provide SLA when min_replica_count=1. If max_replica_count is not set, the default value is min_replica_count. The max allowed replica count is 1000. Available machine types for SMALL shard: e2-standard-2 and all machine types available for MEDIUM and LARGE shard. Available machine types for MEDIUM shard: e2-standard-16 and all machine types available for LARGE shard. Available machine types for LARGE shard: e2-highmem-16, n2d-standard-32. n1-standard-16 and n1-standard-32 are still available, but we recommend e2-standard-16 and e2-highmem-16 for cost efficiency.
        &quot;autoscalingMetricSpecs&quot;: [ # Immutable. The metric specifications that overrides a resource utilization metric (CPU utilization, accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle, and so on) target value (default to 60 if not set). At most one entry is allowed per metric. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is above 0, the autoscaling will be based on both CPU utilization and accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle metrics and scale up when either metrics exceeds its target value while scale down if both metrics are under their target value. The default target value is 60 for both metrics. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target value 60 if not explicitly set. For example, in the case of Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU utilization to 80, you should set autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization` and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to `80`.
          { # The metric specification that defines the target resource utilization (CPU utilization, accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle, and so on) for calculating the desired replica count.
            &quot;metricName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource metric name. Supported metrics: * For Online Prediction: * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/accelerator/duty_cycle` * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization`
            &quot;target&quot;: 42, # The target resource utilization in percentage (1% - 100%) for the given metric; once the real usage deviates from the target by a certain percentage, the machine replicas change. The default value is 60 (representing 60%) if not provided.
          },
        ],
        &quot;machineSpec&quot;: { # Specification of a single machine. # Required. Immutable. The specification of a single machine used by the prediction.
          &quot;acceleratorCount&quot;: 42, # The number of accelerators to attach to the machine.
          &quot;acceleratorType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached to the machine as per accelerator_count.
          &quot;machineType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of the machine. See the [list of machine types supported for prediction](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/configure-compute#machine-types) See the [list of machine types supported for custom training](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/configure-compute#machine-types). For DeployedModel this field is optional, and the default value is `n1-standard-2`. For BatchPredictionJob or as part of WorkerPoolSpec this field is required.
          &quot;tpuTopology&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The topology of the TPUs. Corresponds to the TPU topologies available from GKE. (Example: tpu_topology: &quot;2x2x1&quot;).
        },
        &quot;maxReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The maximum number of replicas this DeployedModel may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, will use min_replica_count as the default value. The value of this field impacts the charge against Vertex CPU and GPU quotas. Specifically, you will be charged for (max_replica_count * number of cores in the selected machine type) and (max_replica_count * number of GPUs per replica in the selected machine type).
        &quot;minReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Required. Immutable. The minimum number of machine replicas this DeployedModel will be always deployed on. This value must be greater than or equal to 1. If traffic against the DeployedModel increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.

          ],
        },
      },
      &quot;deploymentGroup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The deployment group can be no longer than 64 characters (eg: &#x27;test&#x27;, &#x27;prod&#x27;). If not set, we will use the &#x27;default&#x27; deployment group. Creating `deployment_groups` with `reserved_ip_ranges` is a recommended practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except &#x27;default&#x27;) can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed. Note: we only support up to 5 deployment groups(not including &#x27;default&#x27;).

These logs are like standard server access logs, containing information like timestamp and latency for each MatchRequest. Note that logs may incur a cost, especially if the deployed index receives a high queries per second rate (QPS). Estimate your costs before enabling this option.

      &quot;indexSyncTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The DeployedIndex may depend on various data on its original Index. Additionally when certain changes to the original Index are being done (e.g. when what the Index contains is being changed) the DeployedIndex may be asynchronously updated in the background to reflect these changes. If this timestamp&#x27;s value is at least the Index.update_time of the original Index, it means that this DeployedIndex and the original Index are in sync. If this timestamp is older, then to see which updates this DeployedIndex already contains (and which it does not), one must list the operations that are running on the original Index. Only the successfully completed Operations with update_time equal or before this sync time are contained in this DeployedIndex.
      &quot;privateEndpoints&quot;: { # IndexPrivateEndpoints proto is used to provide paths for users to send requests via private endpoints (e.g. private service access, private service connect).

If set, we will deploy the index within the provided ip ranges. Otherwise, the index might be deployed to any ip ranges under the provided VPC network. The value should be the name of the address (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/addresses) Example: [&#x27;vertex-ai-ip-range&#x27;].

This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except &#x27;default&#x27;) can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed.

If this timestamp is older, then to see which updates this DeployedIndex already contains (and which it does not), one must list the operations that are running on the original Index. Only the successfully completed Operations with update_time equal or before this sync time are contained in this DeployedIndex.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="undeployIndex">undeployIndex(indexEndpoint, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Undeploys an Index from an IndexEndpoint, removing a DeployedIndex from it, and freeing all resources it&#x27;s using.

Args:
  indexEndpoint: string, Required. The name of the IndexEndpoint resource from which to undeploy an Index. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/indexEndpoints/{index_endpoint}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for IndexEndpointService.UndeployIndex.
  &quot;deployedIndexId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The ID of the DeployedIndex to be undeployed from the IndexEndpoint.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
