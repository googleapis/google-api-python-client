  <pre>Creates an IndexEndpoint.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the Location to create the IndexEndpoint in. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Indexes are deployed into it. An IndexEndpoint can have multiple DeployedIndexes.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when this IndexEndpoint was created.
  &quot;deployedIndexes&quot;: [ # Output only. The indexes deployed in this endpoint.
    { # A deployment of an Index. IndexEndpoints contain one or more DeployedIndexes.
      &quot;automaticResources&quot;: { # A description of resources that to large degree are decided by Vertex AI, and require only a modest additional configuration. Each Model supporting these resources documents its specific guidelines. # Optional. A description of resources that the DeployedIndex uses, which to large degree are decided by Vertex AI, and optionally allows only a modest additional configuration. If min_replica_count is not set, the default value is 2 (we don&#x27;t provide SLA when min_replica_count=1). If max_replica_count is not set, the default value is min_replica_count. The max allowed replica count is 1000.
        &quot;maxReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The maximum number of replicas this DeployedModel may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, a no upper bound for scaling under heavy traffic will be assume, though Vertex AI may be unable to scale beyond certain replica number.
        &quot;minReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The minimum number of replicas this DeployedModel will be always deployed on. If traffic against it increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas up to max_replica_count, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error.
      },
      &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the DeployedIndex was created.
      &quot;dedicatedResources&quot;: { # A description of resources that are dedicated to a DeployedModel, and that need a higher degree of manual configuration. # Optional. A description of resources that are dedicated to the DeployedIndex, and that need a higher degree of manual configuration. The field min_replica_count must be set to a value strictly greater than 0, or else validation will fail. We don&#x27;t provide SLA when min_replica_count=1. If max_replica_count is not set, the default value is min_replica_count. The max allowed replica count is 1000. Available machine types for SMALL shard: e2-standard-2 and all machine types available for MEDIUM and LARGE shard. Available machine types for MEDIUM shard: e2-standard-16 and all machine types available for LARGE shard. Available machine types for LARGE shard: e2-highmem-16, n2d-standard-32. n1-standard-16 and n1-standard-32 are still available, but we recommend e2-standard-16 and e2-highmem-16 for cost efficiency.
        &quot;autoscalingMetricSpecs&quot;: [ # Immutable. The metric specifications that overrides a resource utilization metric (CPU utilization, accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle, and so on) target value (default to 60 if not set). At most one entry is allowed per metric. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is above 0, the autoscaling will be based on both CPU utilization and accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle metrics and scale up when either metrics exceeds its target value while scale down if both metrics are under their target value. The default target value is 60 for both metrics. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target value 60 if not explicitly set. For example, in the case of Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU utilization to 80, you should set autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization` and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to `80`.
          { # The metric specification that defines the target resource utilization (CPU utilization, accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle, and so on) for calculating the desired replica count.
            &quot;metricName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource metric name. Supported metrics: * For Online Prediction: * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/accelerator/duty_cycle` * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization`
            &quot;target&quot;: 42, # The target resource utilization in percentage (1% - 100%) for the given metric; once the real usage deviates from the target by a certain percentage, the machine replicas change. The default value is 60 (representing 60%) if not provided.
          },
        ],
        &quot;machineSpec&quot;: { # Specification of a single machine. # Required. Immutable. The specification of a single machine used by the prediction.
          &quot;acceleratorCount&quot;: 42, # The number of accelerators to attach to the machine.

          &quot;machineType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of the machine. See the [list of machine types supported for prediction](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/configure-compute#machine-types) See the [list of machine types supported for custom training](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/configure-compute#machine-types). For DeployedModel this field is optional, and the default value is `n1-standard-2`. For BatchPredictionJob or as part of WorkerPoolSpec this field is required.

If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, will use min_replica_count as the default value. The value of this field impacts the charge against Vertex CPU and GPU quotas. Specifically, you will be charged for (max_replica_count * number of cores in the selected machine type) and (max_replica_count * number of GPUs per replica in the selected machine type).
        &quot;minReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Required. Immutable. The minimum number of machine replicas this DeployedModel will be always deployed on. This value must be greater than or equal to 1. If traffic against the DeployedModel increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.
        &quot;spot&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, schedule the deployment workload on [spot VMs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/spot-vms).
      },
      &quot;deployedIndexAuthConfig&quot;: { # Used to set up the auth on the DeployedIndex&#x27;s private endpoint. # Optional. If set, the authentication is enabled for the private endpoint.
        &quot;authProvider&quot;: { # Configuration for an authentication provider, including support for [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32). # Defines the authentication provider that the DeployedIndex uses.
          &quot;allowedIssuers&quot;: [ # A list of allowed JWT issuers. Each entry must be a valid Google service account, in the following format: `service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

          ],
        },

      &quot;deploymentGroup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The deployment group can be no longer than 64 characters (eg: &#x27;test&#x27;, &#x27;prod&#x27;). If not set, we will use the &#x27;default&#x27; deployment group. Creating `deployment_groups` with `reserved_ip_ranges` is a recommended practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except &#x27;default&#x27;) can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed. Note: we only support up to 5 deployment groups(not including &#x27;default&#x27;).

      &quot;enableAccessLogging&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, private endpoint&#x27;s access logs are sent to Cloud Logging. These logs are like standard server access logs, containing information like timestamp and latency for each MatchRequest. Note that logs may incur a cost, especially if the deployed index receives a high queries per second rate (QPS). Estimate your costs before enabling this option.
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The user specified ID of the DeployedIndex. The ID can be up to 128 characters long and must start with a letter and only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. The ID must be unique within the project it is created in.
      &quot;index&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the Index this is the deployment of. We may refer to this Index as the DeployedIndex&#x27;s &quot;original&quot; Index.
      &quot;indexSyncTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The DeployedIndex may depend on various data on its original Index. Additionally when certain changes to the original Index are being done (e.g. when what the Index contains is being changed) the DeployedIndex may be asynchronously updated in the background to reflect these changes. If this timestamp&#x27;s value is at least the Index.update_time of the original Index, it means that this DeployedIndex and the original Index are in sync. If this timestamp is older, then to see which updates this DeployedIndex already contains (and which it does not), one must list the operations that are running on the original Index. Only the successfully completed Operations with update_time equal or before this sync time are contained in this DeployedIndex.
      &quot;privateEndpoints&quot;: { # IndexPrivateEndpoints proto is used to provide paths for users to send requests via private endpoints (e.g. private service access, private service connect).

        ],
        &quot;serviceAttachment&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the service attachment resource. Populated if private service connect is enabled.
      },
      &quot;reservedIpRanges&quot;: [ # Optional. A list of reserved ip ranges under the VPC network that can be used for this DeployedIndex. If set, we will deploy the index within the provided ip ranges. Otherwise, the index might be deployed to any ip ranges under the provided VPC network. The value should be the name of the address (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/addresses) Example: [&#x27;vertex-ai-ip-range&#x27;].

  <pre>Deploys an Index into this IndexEndpoint, creating a DeployedIndex within it. Only non-empty Indexes can be deployed.

Args:
  indexEndpoint: string, Required. The name of the IndexEndpoint resource into which to deploy an Index. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/indexEndpoints/{index_endpoint}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for IndexEndpointService.DeployIndex.
  &quot;deployedIndex&quot;: { # A deployment of an Index. IndexEndpoints contain one or more DeployedIndexes. # Required. The DeployedIndex to be created within the IndexEndpoint.

If min_replica_count is not set, the default value is 2 (we don&#x27;t provide SLA when min_replica_count=1). If max_replica_count is not set, the default value is min_replica_count. The max allowed replica count is 1000.
      &quot;maxReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The maximum number of replicas this DeployedModel may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, a no upper bound for scaling under heavy traffic will be assume, though Vertex AI may be unable to scale beyond certain replica number.
      &quot;minReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The minimum number of replicas this DeployedModel will be always deployed on. If traffic against it increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas up to max_replica_count, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.

If max_replica_count is not set, the default value is min_replica_count. The max allowed replica count is 1000. Available machine types for SMALL shard: e2-standard-2 and all machine types available for MEDIUM and LARGE shard. Available machine types for MEDIUM shard: e2-standard-16 and all machine types available for LARGE shard. Available machine types for LARGE shard: e2-highmem-16, n2d-standard-32. n1-standard-16 and n1-standard-32 are still available, but we recommend e2-standard-16 and e2-highmem-16 for cost efficiency.

If machine_spec.accelerator_count is above 0, the autoscaling will be based on both CPU utilization and accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle metrics and scale up when either metrics exceeds its target value while scale down if both metrics are under their target value. The default target value is 60 for both metrics. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target value 60 if not explicitly set. For example, in the case of Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU utilization to 80, you should set autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization` and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to `80`.

If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, will use min_replica_count as the default value. The value of this field impacts the charge against Vertex CPU and GPU quotas.

If not set, we will use the &#x27;default&#x27; deployment group. Creating `deployment_groups` with `reserved_ip_ranges` is a recommended practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except &#x27;default&#x27;) can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed. Note: we only support up to 5 deployment groups(not including &#x27;default&#x27;).

    &quot;enableAccessLogging&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, private endpoint&#x27;s access logs are sent to Cloud Logging. These logs are like standard server access logs, containing information like timestamp and latency for each MatchRequest. Note that logs may incur a cost, especially if the deployed index receives a high queries per second rate (QPS). Estimate your costs before enabling this option.
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The user specified ID of the DeployedIndex. The ID can be up to 128 characters long and must start with a letter and only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. The ID must be unique within the project it is created in.
    &quot;index&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the Index this is the deployment of. We may refer to this Index as the DeployedIndex&#x27;s &quot;original&quot; Index.
    &quot;indexSyncTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The DeployedIndex may depend on various data on its original Index. Additionally when certain changes to the original Index are being done (e.g. when what the Index contains is being changed) the DeployedIndex may be asynchronously updated in the background to reflect these changes. If this timestamp&#x27;s value is at least the Index.update_time of the original Index, it means that this DeployedIndex and the original Index are in sync. If this timestamp is older, then to see which updates this DeployedIndex already contains (and which it does not), one must list the operations that are running on the original Index. Only the successfully completed Operations with update_time equal or before this sync time are contained in this DeployedIndex.
    &quot;privateEndpoints&quot;: { # IndexPrivateEndpoints proto is used to provide paths for users to send requests via private endpoints (e.g. private service access, private service connect).

If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, a no upper bound for scaling under heavy traffic will be assume, though Vertex AI may be unable to scale beyond certain replica number.

Available machine types for MEDIUM shard: e2-standard-16 and all machine types available for LARGE shard. Available machine types for LARGE shard: e2-highmem-16, n2d-standard-32. n1-standard-16 and n1-standard-32 are still available, but we recommend e2-standard-16 and e2-highmem-16 for cost efficiency.

If not set, we will use the &#x27;default&#x27; deployment group. Creating `deployment_groups` with `reserved_ip_ranges` is a recommended practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except &#x27;default&#x27;) can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed.

If this timestamp&#x27;s value is at least the Index.update_time of the original Index, it means that this DeployedIndex and the original Index are in sync. If this timestamp is older, then to see which updates this DeployedIndex already contains (and which it does not), one must list the operations that are running on the original Index.

      &quot;deploymentGroup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The deployment group can be no longer than 64 characters (eg: &#x27;test&#x27;, &#x27;prod&#x27;). If not set, we will use the &#x27;default&#x27; deployment group. Creating `deployment_groups` with `reserved_ip_ranges` is a recommended practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except &#x27;default&#x27;) can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed. Note: we only support up to 5 deployment groups(not including &#x27;default&#x27;).

If this timestamp&#x27;s value is at least the Index.update_time of the original Index, it means that this DeployedIndex and the original Index are in sync. If this timestamp is older, then to see which updates this DeployedIndex already contains (and which it does not), one must list the operations that are running on the original Index. Only the successfully completed Operations with update_time equal or before this sync time are contained in this DeployedIndex.
