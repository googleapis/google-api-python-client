  <pre>Retrieves a list of reservation slots under a single reservation.

Args:
  project: string, The project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request, formatted as RFC1035. (required)
  parentName: string, The name of the parent reservation and parent block, formatted as
reservations/{reservation_name}/reservationBlocks/{reservation_block_name}/reservationSubBlocks/{reservation_sub_block_name} (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;)
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR
(cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;`
`fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;,
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
