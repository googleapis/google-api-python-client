<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="append">append(spreadsheetId, range, body=None, valueInputOption=None, includeValuesInResponse=None, insertDataOption=None, responseValueRenderOption=None, responseDateTimeRenderOption=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Appends values to a spreadsheet. The input range is used to search for
existing data and find a &quot;table&quot; within that range. Values will be
appended to the next row of the table, starting with the first column of
the table. See the
[guide](/sheets/api/guides/values#appending_values)
and
[sample code](/sheets/api/samples/writing#append_values)
for specific details of how tables are detected and data is appended.

The caller must specify the spreadsheet ID, range, and
a valueInputOption.  The `valueInputOption` only
controls how the input data will be added to the sheet (column-wise or
row-wise), it does not influence what cell the data starts being written
to.

Args:
  spreadsheetId: string, The ID of the spreadsheet to update. (required)
  range: string, The A1 notation of a range to search for a logical table of data.
Values are appended after the last row of the table. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Data within a range of the spreadsheet.
  &quot;values&quot;: [ # The data that was read or to be written.  This is an array of arrays,
      # the outer array representing all the data and each inner array
      # representing a major dimension. Each item in the inner array
      # corresponds with one cell.
      # 
      # For output, empty trailing rows and columns will not be included.
      # 
      # For input, supported value types are: bool, string, and double.
      # Null values will be skipped.
      # To set a cell to an empty value, set the string value to an empty string.
    [
      &quot;&quot;,
    ],
  ],
  &quot;range&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The range the values cover, in A1 notation.
      # For output, this range indicates the entire requested range,
      # even though the values will exclude trailing rows and columns.
      # When appending values, this field represents the range to search for a
      # table, after which values will be appended.
  &quot;majorDimension&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The major dimension of the values.
      # 
      # For output, if the spreadsheet data is: `A1=1,B1=2,A2=3,B2=4`,
      # then requesting `range=A1:B2,majorDimension=ROWS` will return
      # `[[1,2],[3,4]]`,
      # whereas requesting `range=A1:B2,majorDimension=COLUMNS` will return
      # `[[1,3],[2,4]]`.
      # 
      # For input, with `range=A1:B2,majorDimension=ROWS` then `[[1,2],[3,4]]`
      # will set `A1=1,B1=2,A2=3,B2=4`. With `range=A1:B2,majorDimension=COLUMNS`
      # then `[[1,2],[3,4]]` will set `A1=1,B1=3,A2=2,B2=4`.
      # 
      # When writing, if this field is not set, it defaults to ROWS.
}

  valueInputOption: string, How the input data should be interpreted.
  includeValuesInResponse: boolean, Determines if the update response should include the values
of the cells that were appended. By default, responses
do not include the updated values.
  insertDataOption: string, How the input data should be inserted.
  responseValueRenderOption: string, Determines how values in the response should be rendered.
The default render option is ValueRenderOption.FORMATTED_VALUE.
  responseDateTimeRenderOption: string, Determines how dates, times, and durations in the response should be
rendered. This is ignored if response_value_render_option is
FORMATTED_VALUE.
The default dateTime render option is [DateTimeRenderOption.SERIAL_NUMBER].
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
