If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, will use min_replica_count as the default value. The value of this field impacts the charge against Vertex CPU and GPU quotas. Specifically, you will be charged for (max_replica_count * number of cores in the selected machine type) and (max_replica_count * number of GPUs per replica in the selected machine type).
      &quot;minReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Required. Immutable. The minimum number of machine replicas that will be always deployed on. This value must be greater than or equal to 1. If traffic increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.

If set, the deploy/mutate operation will succeed once available_replica_count reaches required_replica_count, and the rest of the replicas will be retried.

The last character must be a letter or number. If the first character is a number, this value may be up to 9 characters, and valid characters are `[0-9]` with no leading zeros.

(Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`.

For example, if the request is for 8 units of NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and gpu_partition_size=&quot;1g.10gb&quot;, the service will create 8 * 7 = 56 partitioned MIG instances. The partition size must be a value supported by the requested accelerator.

  <pre>Generates rubrics for a given prompt. A rubric represents a single testable criterion for evaluation. One input prompt could have multiple rubrics This RPC allows users to get suggested rubrics based on provided prompt, which can then be reviewed and used for subsequent evaluations.

Args:
  location: string, Required. The resource name of the Location to generate rubrics from. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

(Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`.

In order for environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following syntax: $( VARIABLE_NAME) Note that this differs from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used unchanged. To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with `$$`; for example: $$(VARIABLE_NAME) This field corresponds to the `command` field of the Kubernetes Containers [v1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#container-v1-core).

        &quot;env&quot;: [ # Immutable. List of environment variables to set in the container. After the container starts running, code running in the container can read these environment variables. Additionally, the command and args fields can reference these variables. Later entries in this list can also reference earlier entries. For example, the following example sets the variable `VAR_2` to have the value `foo bar`: ```json [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VAR_1&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;foo&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;VAR_2&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;$(VAR_1) bar&quot; } ] ``` If you switch the order of the variables in the example, then the expansion does not occur. This field corresponds to the `env` field of the Kubernetes Containers [v1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#container-v1-core).

Variables that reference a $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the previous defined environment variables in the container and any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not.

To learn about the requirements for the Docker image itself, see [Custom container requirements](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#).

  <pre>Updates a RagEngineConfig.

Args:
  name: string, Identifier. The name of the RagEngineConfig. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/ragEngineConfig` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Config for RagEngine.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The name of the RagEngineConfig. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/ragEngineConfig`

NOTE: This is the default tier if not explicitly chosen. # Sets the RagManagedDb to the Basic tier.
    },
    &quot;enterprise&quot;: { # Enterprise tier offers production grade performance along with autoscaling functionality. It is suitable for customers with large amounts of data or performance sensitive workloads. # Sets the RagManagedDb to the Enterprise tier. This is the default tier if not explicitly chosen.
    },
    &quot;scaled&quot;: { # Scaled tier offers production grade performance along with autoscaling functionality. It is suitable for customers with large amounts of data or performance sensitive workloads. # Sets the RagManagedDb to the Scaled tier.
    },
    &quot;unprovisioned&quot;: { # Disables the RAG Engine service and deletes all your data held within this service. This will halt the billing of the service. NOTE: Once deleted the data cannot be recovered. To start using RAG Engine again, you will need to update the tier by calling the UpdateRagEngineConfig API. # Sets the RagManagedDb to the Unprovisioned tier.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name.
