    },
    &quot;sslCaCertificate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. SSL Certificate Authority certificate to use for requests to GitLab Enterprise instance.
    &quot;webhookSecretSecretVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. SecretManager resource containing the webhook secret of a GitLab project, formatted as `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. This is used to validate webhooks.
  },
  &quot;installationState&quot;: { # Describes stage and necessary actions to be taken by the user to complete the installation. Used for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise based connections. # Output only. Installation state of the Connection.
    &quot;actionUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Link to follow for next action. Empty string if the installation is already complete.
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Message of what the user should do next to continue the installation. Empty string if the installation is already complete.
    &quot;stage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Current step of the installation process.
  },
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels as key value pairs
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The resource name of the connection, in the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/connections/{connection_id}`.
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Set to true when the connection is being set up or updated in the background.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A system-assigned unique identifier for a the GitRepositoryLink.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Update timestamp
}

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set to true, and the connection is not found a new connection will be created. In this situation `update_mask` is ignored. The creation will succeed only if the input connection has all the necessary information (e.g a github_config with both user_oauth_token and installation_id properties).
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Optional. Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Connection resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, validate the request, but do not actually post it.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
