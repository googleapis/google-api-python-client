    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Create timestamp
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Delete timestamp
  &quot;disabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If disabled is set to true, functionality is disabled for this connection. Repository based API methods and webhooks processing for repositories in this connection will be disabled.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;githubConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for connections to github.com. # Configuration for connections to github.com.
    &quot;appInstallationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. GitHub App installation id.
    &quot;authorizerCredential&quot;: { # Represents an OAuth token of the account that authorized the Connection, and associated metadata. # Optional. OAuth credential of the account that authorized the GitHub App. It is recommended to use a robot account instead of a human user account. The OAuth token must be tied to the GitHub App of this config.
      &quot;oauthTokenSecretVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A SecretManager resource containing the OAuth token that authorizes the connection. Format: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`.
      &quot;username&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The username associated with this token.
    },
    &quot;githubApp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The GitHub Application that was installed to the GitHub user or organization.
    &quot;installationUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The URI to navigate to in order to manage the installation associated with this GitHubConfig.
  },
  &quot;installationState&quot;: { # Describes stage and necessary actions to be taken by the user to complete the installation. Used for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise based connections. # Output only. Installation state of the Connection.
    &quot;actionUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Link to follow for next action. Empty string if the installation is already complete.
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Message of what the user should do next to continue the installation. Empty string if the installation is already complete.
    &quot;stage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Current step of the installation process.
  },
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels as key value pairs
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,

}

  connectionId: string, Required. Id of the requesting object If auto-generating Id server-side, remove this field and connection_id from the method_signature of Create RPC
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, validate the request, but do not actually post it.

  <pre>Updates the parameters of a single Connection.

Args:
  name: string, Identifier. The resource name of the connection, in the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/connections/{connection_id}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Message describing Connection object
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Optional. Allows clients to store small amounts of arbitrary data.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Create timestamp
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Delete timestamp
  &quot;disabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If disabled is set to true, functionality is disabled for this connection. Repository based API methods and webhooks processing for repositories in this connection will be disabled.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;githubConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for connections to github.com. # Configuration for connections to github.com.
    &quot;appInstallationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. GitHub App installation id.
    &quot;authorizerCredential&quot;: { # Represents an OAuth token of the account that authorized the Connection, and associated metadata. # Optional. OAuth credential of the account that authorized the GitHub App. It is recommended to use a robot account instead of a human user account. The OAuth token must be tied to the GitHub App of this config.
      &quot;oauthTokenSecretVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A SecretManager resource containing the OAuth token that authorizes the connection. Format: `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`.
      &quot;username&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The username associated with this token.
    },
    &quot;githubApp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The GitHub Application that was installed to the GitHub user or organization.
    &quot;installationUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The URI to navigate to in order to manage the installation associated with this GitHubConfig.
  },
  &quot;installationState&quot;: { # Describes stage and necessary actions to be taken by the user to complete the installation. Used for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise based connections. # Output only. Installation state of the Connection.
    &quot;actionUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Link to follow for next action. Empty string if the installation is already complete.
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Message of what the user should do next to continue the installation. Empty string if the installation is already complete.
    &quot;stage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Current step of the installation process.
  },
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels as key value pairs
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The resource name of the connection, in the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/connections/{connection_id}`.
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Set to true when the connection is being set up or updated in the background.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A system-assigned unique identifier for a the GitRepositoryLink.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Update timestamp
}

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set to true, and the connection is not found a new connection will be created. In this situation `update_mask` is ignored. The creation will succeed only if the input connection has all the necessary information (e.g a github_config with both user_oauth_token and installation_id properties).
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Connection resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, validate the request, but do not actually post it.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
