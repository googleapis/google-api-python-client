  <pre>Creates a log bucket that can be used to store log entries. After a bucket has been created, the bucket&#x27;s location cannot be changed.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource in which to create the log bucket: &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot; For example:&quot;projects/my-project/locations/global&quot; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
