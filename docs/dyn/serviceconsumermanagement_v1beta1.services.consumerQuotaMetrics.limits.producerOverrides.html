  <pre>Creates a producer override. A producer override is applied by the owner or administrator of a service to increase or decrease the amount of quota a consumer of the service is allowed to use. To create multiple overrides at once, use ImportProducerOverrides instead. If an override with the specified dimensions already exists, this call will fail. To overwrite an existing override if one is already present (&quot;upsert&quot; semantics), use ImportProducerOverrides instead.

Args:
  parent: string, The resource name of the parent quota limit, returned by a ListConsumerQuotaMetrics or GetConsumerQuotaMetric call. An example name would be: `services/compute.googleapis.com/projects/123/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A quota override
  &quot;adminOverrideAncestor&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the ancestor that requested the override. For example: &quot;organizations/12345&quot; or &quot;folders/67890&quot;. Used by admin overrides only.
  &quot;dimensions&quot;: { #  If this map is nonempty, then this override applies only to specific values for dimensions defined in the limit unit. For example, an override on a limit with the unit 1/{project}/{region} could contain an entry with the key &quot;region&quot; and the value &quot;us-east-1&quot;; the override is only applied to quota consumed in that region. This map has the following restrictions: * Keys that are not defined in the limit&#x27;s unit are not valid keys. Any string appearing in {brackets} in the unit (besides {project} or {user}) is a defined key. * &quot;project&quot; is not a valid key; the project is already specified in the parent resource name. * &quot;user&quot; is not a valid key; the API does not support quota overrides that apply only to a specific user. * If &quot;region&quot; appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud region. * If &quot;zone&quot; appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud zone. * If any valid key other than &quot;region&quot; or &quot;zone&quot; appears in the map, then all valid keys other than &quot;region&quot; or &quot;zone&quot; must also appear in the map.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;metric&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the metric to which this override applies. An example name would be: `compute.googleapis.com/cpus`
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the producer override. An example name would be: `services/compute.googleapis.com/projects/123/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion/producerOverrides/4a3f2c1d`
  &quot;overrideValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The overriding quota limit value. Can be any nonnegative integer, or -1 (unlimited quota).
  &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The limit unit of the limit to which this override applies. An example unit would be: `1/{project}/{region}` Note that `{project}` and `{region}` are not placeholders in this example; the literal characters `{` and `}` occur in the string.
}

  force: boolean, Whether to force the creation of the quota override. Setting the force parameter to &#x27;true&#x27; ignores all quota safety checks that would fail the request. QuotaSafetyCheck lists all such validations.
  forceOnly: string, The list of quota safety checks to ignore before the override mutation. Unlike &#x27;force&#x27; field that ignores all the quota safety checks, the &#x27;force_only&#x27; field ignores only the specified checks; other checks are still enforced.
