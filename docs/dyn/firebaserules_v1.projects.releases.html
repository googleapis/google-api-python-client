  <pre>Create a `Release`. Release names should reflect the developer&#x27;s deployment practices. For example, the release name may include the environment name, application name, application version, or any other name meaningful to the developer. Once a `Release` refers to a `Ruleset`, the rules can be enforced by Firebase Rules-enabled services. More than one `Release` may be &#x27;live&#x27; concurrently. Consider the following three `Release` names for `projects/foo` and the `Ruleset` to which they refer. Release Name -&gt; Ruleset Name * projects/foo/releases/prod -&gt; projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123 * projects/foo/releases/prod/beta -&gt; projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123 * projects/foo/releases/prod/v23 -&gt; projects/foo/rulesets/uuid456 The relationships reflect a `Ruleset` rollout in progress. The `prod` and `prod/beta` releases refer to the same `Ruleset`. However, `prod/v23` refers to a new `Ruleset`. The `Ruleset` reference for a `Release` may be updated using the UpdateRelease method.
