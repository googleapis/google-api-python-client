<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Create a `Release`.

Release names should reflect the developer&#x27;s deployment practices. For
example, the release name may include the environment name, application
name, application version, or any other name meaningful to the developer.
Once a `Release` refers to a `Ruleset`, the rules can be enforced by
Firebase Rules-enabled services.

More than one `Release` may be &#x27;live&#x27; concurrently. Consider the following
three `Release` names for `projects/foo` and the `Ruleset` to which they
refer.

Release Name                    | Ruleset Name
--------------------------------|-------------
projects/foo/releases/prod      | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123
projects/foo/releases/prod/beta | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123
projects/foo/releases/prod/v23  | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid456

The table reflects the `Ruleset` rollout in progress. The `prod` and
`prod/beta` releases refer to the same `Ruleset`. However, `prod/v23`
refers to a new `Ruleset`. The `Ruleset` reference for a `Release` may be
updated using the UpdateRelease method.

Args:
  name: string, Resource name for the project which owns this `Release`.

Format: `projects/{project_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # `Release` is a named reference to a `Ruleset`. Once a `Release` refers to a
    # `Ruleset`, rules-enabled services will be able to enforce the `Ruleset`.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time the release was created.
      # Output only.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time the release was updated.
      # Output only.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name for the `Release`.
      # 
      # `Release` names may be structured `app1/prod/v2` or flat `app1_prod_v2`
      # which affords developers a great deal of flexibility in mapping the name
      # to the style that best fits their existing development practices. For
      # example, a name could refer to an environment, an app, a version, or some
      # combination of three.
      # 
      # In the table below, for the project name `projects/foo`, the following
      # relative release paths show how flat and structured names might be chosen
      # to match a desired development / deployment strategy.
      #

      # Versions     | releases/app1_v2_qa | releases/app1/v2/qa
      # 
      # The delimiter between the release name path elements can be almost anything
      # and it should work equally well with the release name list filter, but in
      # many ways the structured paths provide a clearer picture of the
      # relationship between `Release` instances.
      # 
      # Format: `projects/{project_id}/releases/{release_id}`
  &quot;rulesetName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the `Ruleset` referred to by this `Release`. The `Ruleset` must
      # exist the `Release` to be created.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(name, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, filter=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>List the `Release` values for a project. This list may optionally be
filtered by `Release` name, `Ruleset` name, `TestSuite` name, or any
combination thereof.

Args:
  name: string, Resource name for the project.

Format: `projects/{project_id}` (required)
  pageToken: string, Next page token for the next batch of `Release` instances.
  pageSize: integer, Page size to load. Maximum of 100. Defaults to 10.
Note: `page_size` is just a hint and the service may choose to load fewer
than `page_size` results due to the size of the output. To traverse all of
the releases, the caller should iterate until the `page_token` on the
response is empty.
  filter: string, `Release` filter. The list method supports filters with restrictions on the
`Release.name`, `Release.ruleset_name`, and `Release.test_suite_name`.

Example 1: A filter of &#x27;name=prod*&#x27; might return `Release`s with names
within &#x27;projects/foo&#x27; prefixed with &#x27;prod&#x27;:

Name                          | Ruleset Name
------------------------------|-------------
projects/foo/releases/prod    | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid1234
projects/foo/releases/prod/v1 | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid1234
projects/foo/releases/prod/v2 | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid8888

Example 2: A filter of `name=prod* ruleset_name=uuid1234` would return only
`Release` instances for &#x27;projects/foo&#x27; with names prefixed with &#x27;prod&#x27;
referring to the same `Ruleset` name of &#x27;uuid1234&#x27;:

Name                          | Ruleset Name
------------------------------|-------------
projects/foo/releases/prod    | projects/foo/rulesets/1234
projects/foo/releases/prod/v1 | projects/foo/rulesets/1234

In the examples, the filter parameters refer to the search filters are
relative to the project. Fully qualified prefixed may also be used. e.g.
`test_suite_name=projects/foo/testsuites/uuid1`
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
