<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Create a `Release`.

Release names should reflect the developer's deployment practices. For
example, the release name may include the environment name, application
name, application version, or any other name meaningful to the developer.
Once a `Release` refers to a `Ruleset`, the rules can be enforced by
Firebase Rules-enabled services.

More than one `Release` may be 'live' concurrently. Consider the following
three `Release` names for `projects/foo` and the `Ruleset` to which they
refer.

Release Name                    | Ruleset Name
--------------------------------|-------------
projects/foo/releases/prod      | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123
projects/foo/releases/prod/beta | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123
projects/foo/releases/prod/v23  | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid456

The table reflects the `Ruleset` rollout in progress. The `prod` and
`prod/beta` releases refer to the same `Ruleset`. However, `prod/v23`
refers to a new `Ruleset`. The `Ruleset` reference for a `Release` may be
updated using the UpdateRelease method.

Args:
  name: string, Resource name for the project which owns this `Release`.

Format: `projects/{project_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # `Release` is a named reference to a `Ruleset`. Once a `Release` refers to a
      # `Ruleset`, rules-enabled services will be able to enforce the `Ruleset`.
    "updateTime": "A String", # Time the release was updated.
        # Output only.
    "rulesetName": "A String", # Name of the `Ruleset` referred to by this `Release`. The `Ruleset` must
        # exist the `Release` to be created.
    "createTime": "A String", # Time the release was created.
        # Output only.
    "name": "A String", # Resource name for the `Release`.
        # 
        # `Release` names may be structured `app1/prod/v2` or flat `app1_prod_v2`
        # which affords developers a great deal of flexibility in mapping the name
        # to the style that best fits their existing development practices. For

        # and it should work equally well with the release name list filter, but in
        # many ways the structured paths provide a clearer picture of the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(name, pageSize=None, filter=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>List the `Release` values for a project. This list may optionally be
filtered by `Release` name, `Ruleset` name, `TestSuite` name, or any
combination thereof.

Args:
  name: string, Resource name for the project.

Format: `projects/{project_id}` (required)
  pageSize: integer, Page size to load. Maximum of 100. Defaults to 10.
Note: `page_size` is just a hint and the service may choose to load fewer
than `page_size` results due to the size of the output. To traverse all of
the releases, the caller should iterate until the `page_token` on the
response is empty.
  filter: string, `Release` filter. The list method supports filters with restrictions on the
`Release.name`, `Release.ruleset_name`, and `Release.test_suite_name`.

Example 1: A filter of 'name=prod*' might return `Release`s with names
within 'projects/foo' prefixed with 'prod':

Name                          | Ruleset Name
------------------------------|-------------
projects/foo/releases/prod    | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid1234
projects/foo/releases/prod/v1 | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid1234
projects/foo/releases/prod/v2 | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid8888

Example 2: A filter of `name=prod* ruleset_name=uuid1234` would return only
`Release` instances for 'projects/foo' with names prefixed with 'prod'
referring to the same `Ruleset` name of 'uuid1234':

Name                          | Ruleset Name
------------------------------|-------------
projects/foo/releases/prod    | projects/foo/rulesets/1234
projects/foo/releases/prod/v1 | projects/foo/rulesets/1234

In the examples, the filter parameters refer to the search filters are
relative to the project. Fully qualified prefixed may also be used. e.g.
`test_suite_name=projects/foo/testsuites/uuid1`
  pageToken: string, Next page token for the next batch of `Release` instances.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response for FirebaseRulesService.ListReleases.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # The pagination token to retrieve the next page of results. If the value is
        # empty, no further results remain.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Update a `Release`.

Only updates to the `ruleset_name` and `test_suite_name` fields will be
honored. `Release` rename is not supported. To create a `Release` use the
CreateRelease method.

Args:
  name: string, Resource name for the `Release`.

`Release` names may be structured `app1/prod/v2` or flat `app1_prod_v2`
which affords developers a great deal of flexibility in mapping the name
to the style that best fits their existing development practices. For
example, a name could refer to an environment, an app, a version, or some
combination of three.

In the table below, for the project name `projects/foo`, the following
relative release paths show how flat and structured names might be chosen
to match a desired development / deployment strategy.

Use Case     | Flat Name           | Structured Name
-------------|---------------------|----------------
Environments | releases/qa         | releases/qa
Apps         | releases/app1_qa    | releases/app1/qa
Versions     | releases/app1_v2_qa | releases/app1/v2/qa

The delimiter between the release name path elements can be almost anything
and it should work equally well with the release name list filter, but in
many ways the structured paths provide a clearer picture of the
relationship between `Release` instances.

Format: `projects/{project_id}/releases/{release_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:
