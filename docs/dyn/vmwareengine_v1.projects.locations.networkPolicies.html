  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a network policy resource. Network policies are regional resources. You can use a network policy to enable or disable internet access and external IP access. Network policies are associated with a VMware Engine network, which might span across regions. For a given region, a network policy applies to all private clouds in the VMware Engine network associated with the policy.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of this resource.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. User-provided description for this network policy.
  &quot;edgeServicesCidr&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. IP address range in CIDR notation used to create internet access and external IP access. An RFC 1918 CIDR block, with a &quot;/26&quot; prefix, is required. The range cannot overlap with any prefixes either in the consumer VPC network or in use by the private clouds attached to that VPC network.
  &quot;externalIp&quot;: { # Represents a network service that is managed by a `NetworkPolicy` resource. A network service provides a way to control an aspect of external access to VMware workloads. For example, whether the VMware workloads in the private clouds governed by a network policy can access or be accessed from the internet. # Network service that allows External IP addresses to be assigned to VMware workloads. This service can only be enabled when `internet_access` is also enabled.
    &quot;enabled&quot;: True or False, # True if the service is enabled; false otherwise.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the service. New values may be added to this enum when appropriate.
  },
  &quot;internetAccess&quot;: { # Represents a network service that is managed by a `NetworkPolicy` resource. A network service provides a way to control an aspect of external access to VMware workloads. For example, whether the VMware workloads in the private clouds governed by a network policy can access or be accessed from the internet. # Network service that allows VMware workloads to access the internet.
    &quot;enabled&quot;: True or False, # True if the service is enabled; false otherwise.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the service. New values may be added to this enum when appropriate.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Identifier. The resource name of this network policy. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/networkPolicies/my-network-policy`
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. System-generated unique identifier for the resource.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of this resource.
  &quot;vmwareEngineNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The relative resource name of the VMware Engine network. Specify the name in the following form: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}` where `{project}` can either be a project number or a project ID.
  &quot;vmwareEngineNetworkCanonical&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The canonical name of the VMware Engine network in the form: `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}`
}

  networkPolicyId: string, Required. The user-provided identifier of the network policy to be created. This identifier must be unique within parent `projects/{my-project}/locations/{us-central1}/networkPolicies` and becomes the final token in the name URI. The identifier must meet the following requirements: * Only contains 1-63 alphanumeric characters and hyphens * Begins with an alphabetical character * Ends with a non-hyphen character * Not formatted as a UUID * Complies with [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) (section 3.5)
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body=None, requestId=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Modifies a `NetworkPolicy` resource. Only the following fields can be updated: `internet_access`, `external_ip`, `edge_services_cidr`. Only fields specified in `updateMask` are applied. When updating a network policy, the external IP network service can only be disabled if there are no external IP addresses present in the scope of the policy. Also, a `NetworkService` cannot be updated when `NetworkService.state` is set to `RECONCILING`. During operation processing, the resource is temporarily in the `ACTIVE` state before the operation fully completes. For that period of time, you can&#x27;t update the resource. Use the operation status to determine when the processing fully completes.

Args:
  name: string, Output only. Identifier. The resource name of this network policy. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/networkPolicies/my-network-policy` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a network policy resource. Network policies are regional resources. You can use a network policy to enable or disable internet access and external IP access. Network policies are associated with a VMware Engine network, which might span across regions. For a given region, a network policy applies to all private clouds in the VMware Engine network associated with the policy.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of this resource.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. User-provided description for this network policy.
  &quot;edgeServicesCidr&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. IP address range in CIDR notation used to create internet access and external IP access. An RFC 1918 CIDR block, with a &quot;/26&quot; prefix, is required. The range cannot overlap with any prefixes either in the consumer VPC network or in use by the private clouds attached to that VPC network.
  &quot;externalIp&quot;: { # Represents a network service that is managed by a `NetworkPolicy` resource. A network service provides a way to control an aspect of external access to VMware workloads. For example, whether the VMware workloads in the private clouds governed by a network policy can access or be accessed from the internet. # Network service that allows External IP addresses to be assigned to VMware workloads. This service can only be enabled when `internet_access` is also enabled.
    &quot;enabled&quot;: True or False, # True if the service is enabled; false otherwise.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the service. New values may be added to this enum when appropriate.
  },
  &quot;internetAccess&quot;: { # Represents a network service that is managed by a `NetworkPolicy` resource. A network service provides a way to control an aspect of external access to VMware workloads. For example, whether the VMware workloads in the private clouds governed by a network policy can access or be accessed from the internet. # Network service that allows VMware workloads to access the internet.
    &quot;enabled&quot;: True or False, # True if the service is enabled; false otherwise.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the service. New values may be added to this enum when appropriate.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Identifier. The resource name of this network policy. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/networkPolicies/my-network-policy`
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. System-generated unique identifier for the resource.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of this resource.
  &quot;vmwareEngineNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The relative resource name of the VMware Engine network. Specify the name in the following form: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}` where `{project}` can either be a project number or a project ID.
  &quot;vmwareEngineNetworkCanonical&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The canonical name of the VMware Engine network in the form: `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/vmwareEngineNetworks/{vmware_engine_network_id}`
}

  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `NetworkPolicy` resource by the update. The fields specified in the `update_mask` are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
