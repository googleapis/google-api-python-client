Args:
  name: string, Required. The project (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3#project_name) in which to create the alerting policy. The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER] Note that this field names the parent container in which the alerting policy will be written, not the name of the created policy. |name| must be a host project of a Metrics Scope, otherwise INVALID_ARGUMENT error will return. The alerting policy that is returned will have a name that contains a normalized representation of this name as a prefix but adds a suffix of the form /alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID], identifying the policy in the container. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A description of the conditions under which some aspect of your system is considered to be &quot;unhealthy&quot; and the ways to notify people or services about this state. For an overview of alert policies, see Introduction to Alerting (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/).
  &quot;alertStrategy&quot;: { # Control over how the notification channels in notification_channels are notified when this alert fires. # Control over how this alert policy&#x27;s notification channels are notified.
    &quot;autoClose&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If an alert policy that was active has no data for this long, any open incidents will close
    &quot;notificationRateLimit&quot;: { # Control over the rate of notifications sent to this alert policy&#x27;s notification channels. # Required for alert policies with a LogMatch condition.This limit is not implemented for alert policies that are not log-based.
      &quot;period&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Not more than one notification per period.
    },
  },
  &quot;combiner&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # How to combine the results of multiple conditions to determine if an incident should be opened. If condition_time_series_query_language is present, this must be COMBINE_UNSPECIFIED.
  &quot;conditions&quot;: [ # A list of conditions for the policy. The conditions are combined by AND or OR according to the combiner field. If the combined conditions evaluate to true, then an incident is created. A policy can have from one to six conditions. If condition_time_series_query_language is present, it must be the only condition.
    { # A condition is a true/false test that determines when an alerting policy should open an incident. If a condition evaluates to true, it signifies that something is wrong.
      &quot;conditionAbsent&quot;: { # A condition type that checks that monitored resources are reporting data. The configuration defines a metric and a set of monitored resources. The predicate is considered in violation when a time series for the specified metric of a monitored resource does not include any data in the specified duration. # A condition that checks that a time series continues to receive new data points.
        &quot;aggregations&quot;: [ # Specifies the alignment of data points in individual time series as well as how to combine the retrieved time series together (such as when aggregating multiple streams on each resource to a single stream for each resource or when aggregating streams across all members of a group of resources). Multiple aggregations are applied in the order specified.This field is similar to the one in the ListTimeSeries request (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.timeSeries/list). It is advisable to use the ListTimeSeries method when debugging this field.
          { # Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of the data. Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example &quot;the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster&quot;. This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown. For more details, see Filtering and aggregation (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/aggregation).

This will be done before the per-series aligner can be applied to the data.The value must be at least 60 seconds. If a per-series aligner other than ALIGN_NONE is specified, this field is required or an error is returned. If no per-series aligner is specified, or the aligner ALIGN_NONE is specified, then this field is ignored.The maximum value of the alignment_period is 104 weeks (2 years) for charts, and 90,000 seconds (25 hours) for alerting policies.
            &quot;crossSeriesReducer&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The reduction operation to be used to combine time series into a single time series, where the value of each data point in the resulting series is a function of all the already aligned values in the input time series.Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid choices depend on the metric_kind and the value_type of the original time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different metric_kind or value_type than the input time series.Time series data must first be aligned (see per_series_aligner) in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If cross_series_reducer is specified, then per_series_aligner must be specified, and must not be ALIGN_NONE. An alignment_period must also be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.
            &quot;groupByFields&quot;: [ # The set of fields to preserve when cross_series_reducer is specified. The group_by_fields determine how the time series are partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly one subset. The cross_series_reducer is applied to each subset of time series. It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so this field implicitly contains resource.type. Fields not specified in group_by_fields are aggregated away. If group_by_fields is not specified and all the time series have the same resource type, then the time series are aggregated into a single output time series. If cross_series_reducer is not defined, this field is ignored.

Alignment can change the metric_kind or the value_type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If cross_series_reducer is specified, then per_series_aligner must be specified and not equal to ALIGN_NONE and alignment_period must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.

Larger values that are a multiple of a minute--for example, 240 or 300 seconds--are supported. If an invalid value is given, an error will be returned. The Duration.nanos field is ignored.
        &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required.

        &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A logs-based filter. See Advanced Logs Queries (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries) for how this filter should be constructed.

When choosing a duration, it is useful to keep in mind the frequency of the underlying time series data (which may also be affected by any alignments specified in the aggregations field); a good duration is long enough so that a single outlier does not generate spurious alerts, but short enough that unhealthy states are detected and alerted on quickly.

Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example &quot;the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster&quot;.
