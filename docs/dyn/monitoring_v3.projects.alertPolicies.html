Args:
  name: string, Required. The project (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3#project_name) in which to create the alerting policy. The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER] Note that this field names the parent container in which the alerting policy will be written, not the name of the created policy. |name| must be a host project of a Metrics Scope, otherwise INVALID_ARGUMENT error will return. The alerting policy that is returned will have a name that contains a normalized representation of this name as a prefix but adds a suffix of the form /alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID], identifying the policy in the container. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;conditions&quot;: [ # A list of conditions for the policy. The conditions are combined by AND or OR according to the combiner field. If the combined conditions evaluate to true, then an incident is created. A policy can have from one to six conditions.

        &quot;aggregations&quot;: [ # Specifies the alignment of data points in individual time series as well as how to combine the retrieved time series together (such as when aggregating multiple streams on each resource to a single stream for each resource or when aggregating streams across all members of a group of resources). Multiple aggregations are applied in the order specified.This field is similar to the one in the ListTimeSeries request (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.timeSeries/list). It is advisable to use the ListTimeSeries method when debugging this field.
          { # Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of the data. Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example &quot;the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster&quot;. This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown.

If a per-series aligner other than ALIGN_NONE is specified, this field is required or an error is returned. If no per-series aligner is specified, or the aligner ALIGN_NONE is specified, then this field is ignored.The maximum value of the alignment_period is 104 weeks (2 years) for charts, and 90,000 seconds (25 hours) for alerting policies.

The valid choices depend on the metric_kind and the value_type of the original time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different metric_kind or value_type than the input time series.Time series data must first be aligned (see per_series_aligner) in order to perform cross-time series reduction.

Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly one subset. The cross_series_reducer is applied to each subset of time series. It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so this field implicitly contains resource.type. Fields not specified in group_by_fields are aggregated away.

Alignment can change the metric_kind or the value_type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction.

When choosing a duration, it is useful to keep in mind the frequency of the underlying time series data (which may also be affected by any alignments specified in the aggregations field); a good duration is long enough so that a single outlier does not generate spurious alerts, but short enough that unhealthy states are detected and alerted on quickly.

We must also update the contents of all Prometheus alerts in case the information of their rule group changes.The PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition protocol buffer combines the information of the corresponding rule group and alerting rule. The structure of the PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition protocol buffer does NOT mimic the structure of the Prometheus rule group and alerting rule YAML declarations.

First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example &quot;the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster&quot;. This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown.

This gives you continuity with the former policy in your notifications and incidents. Conditions in the new policy will keep their former [CONDITION_ID] if the supplied condition includes the name field with that [CONDITION_ID]. If the supplied condition omits the name field, then a new [CONDITION_ID] is created.

First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals.

Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example &quot;the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster&quot;.

Conditions without names are added to the updated policy.

Otherwise, treat the change as a new condition and let the existing condition be deleted.
