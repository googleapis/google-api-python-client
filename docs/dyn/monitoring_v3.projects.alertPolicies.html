  <pre>Creates a new alerting policy.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The project in which to create the alerting policy. The format is:
projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]
Note that this field names the parent container in which the alerting policy will be written, not the name of the created policy. |name| must be a host project of a workspace, otherwise INVALID_ARGUMENT error will return. The alerting policy that is returned will have a name that contains a normalized representation of this name as a prefix but adds a suffix of the form /alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID], identifying the policy in the container. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A description of the conditions under which some aspect of your system is considered to be &quot;unhealthy&quot; and the ways to notify people or services about this state. For an overview of alert policies, see Introduction to Alerting (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/).
  &quot;notificationChannels&quot;: [ # Identifies the notification channels to which notifications should be sent when incidents are opened or closed or when new violations occur on an already opened incident. Each element of this array corresponds to the name field in each of the NotificationChannel objects that are returned from the ListNotificationChannels method. The format of the entries in this field is:
      # projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;mutationRecord&quot;: { # Describes a change made to a configuration. # A read-only record of the most recent change to the alerting policy. If provided in a call to create or update, this field will be ignored.
    &quot;mutateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When the change occurred.
    &quot;mutatedBy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The email address of the user making the change.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required if the policy exists. The resource name for this policy. The format is:
      # projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID]
      # [ALERT_POLICY_ID] is assigned by Stackdriver Monitoring when the policy is created. When calling the alertPolicies.create method, do not include the name field in the alerting policy passed as part of the request.
  &quot;validity&quot;: { # The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC (https://github.com/grpc). Each Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the API Design Guide (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Read-only description of how the alert policy is invalid. OK if the alert policy is valid. If not OK, the alert policy will not generate incidents.
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

Keys must begin with a letter.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A short name or phrase used to identify the policy in dashboards, notifications, and incidents. To avoid confusion, don&#x27;t use the same display name for multiple policies in the same project. The name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.
  &quot;enabled&quot;: True or False, # Whether or not the policy is enabled. On write, the default interpretation if unset is that the policy is enabled. On read, clients should not make any assumption about the state if it has not been populated. The field should always be populated on List and Get operations, unless a field projection has been specified that strips it out.
  &quot;combiner&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # How to combine the results of multiple conditions to determine if an incident should be opened. If condition_time_series_query_language is present, this must be COMBINE_UNSPECIFIED.
  &quot;conditions&quot;: [ # A list of conditions for the policy. The conditions are combined by AND or OR according to the combiner field. If the combined conditions evaluate to true, then an incident is created. A policy can have from one to six conditions. If condition_time_series_query_language is present, it must be the only condition.
    { # A condition is a true/false test that determines when an alerting policy should open an incident. If a condition evaluates to true, it signifies that something is wrong.
      &quot;conditionAbsent&quot;: { # A condition type that checks that monitored resources are reporting data. The configuration defines a metric and a set of monitored resources. The predicate is considered in violation when a time series for the specified metric of a monitored resource does not include any data in the specified duration. # A condition that checks that a time series continues to receive new data points.
        &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A filter (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/filters) that identifies which time series should be compared with the threshold.The filter is similar to the one that is specified in the ListTimeSeries request (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.timeSeries/list) (that call is useful to verify the time series that will be retrieved / processed) and must specify the metric type and optionally may contain restrictions on resource type, resource labels, and metric labels. This field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters in length.
        &quot;duration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The amount of time that a time series must fail to report new data to be considered failing. Currently, only values that are a multiple of a minute--e.g. 60, 120, or 300 seconds--are supported. If an invalid value is given, an error will be returned. The Duration.nanos field is ignored.
        &quot;aggregations&quot;: [ # Specifies the alignment of data points in individual time series as well as how to combine the retrieved time series together (such as when aggregating multiple streams on each resource to a single stream for each resource or when aggregating streams across all members of a group of resrouces).

It is advisable to use the ListTimeSeries method when debugging this field.
          { # Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of the data. Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example &quot;the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster&quot;. This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown.
