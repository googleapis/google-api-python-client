    The object takes the form of:

It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear.

In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language.

It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved.

This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.

Args:

If `filter` is empty, then no constraints are applied and all accounts (paginated) are retrieved for the requested account.

  pageSize: integer, Optional. How many accounts to fetch per page. The default and maximum is 20.
  pageToken: string, Optional. If specified, the next page of accounts is retrieved. The `pageToken` is returned when a call to `accounts.list` returns more results than can fit into the requested page size.
  parentAccount: string, Optional. The resource name of the account for which the list of directly accessible accounts is to be retrieved. This only makes sense for Organizations and User Groups. If empty, will return `ListAccounts` for the authenticated user. `accounts/{account_id}`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
