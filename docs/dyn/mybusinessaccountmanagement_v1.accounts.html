  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An account is a container for your location. If you are the only user who manages locations for your business, you can use your personal Google Account. To share management of locations with multiple users, [create a business account] (https://support.google.com/business/answer/6085339?ref_topic=6085325).
  &quot;accountName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the account. For an account of type `PERSONAL`, this is the first and last name of the user account.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The resource name, in the format `accounts/{account_id}`.

It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear.

In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.

  <pre>Lists all of the accounts for the authenticated user. This includes all accounts that the user owns, as well as any accounts for which the user has management rights.

Args:
  filter: string, Optional. A filter constraining the accounts to return. The response includes only entries that match the filter. If `filter` is empty, then no constraints are applied and all accounts (paginated) are retrieved for the requested account. For example, a request with the filter `type=USER_GROUP` will only return user groups. The `type` field is the only supported filter.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. How many accounts to fetch per page. The minimum supported page_size is 2. The default and maximum is 20.
  pageToken: string, Optional. If specified, the next page of accounts is retrieved. The `pageToken` is returned when a call to `accounts.list` returns more results than can fit into the requested page size.
  parentAccount: string, Optional. The resource name of the account for which the list of directly accessible accounts is to be retrieved. This only makes sense for Organizations and User Groups. If empty, will return `ListAccounts` for the authenticated user. `accounts/{account_id}`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
