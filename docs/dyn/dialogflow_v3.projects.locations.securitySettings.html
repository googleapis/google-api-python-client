User must set a value lower than Dialogflow&#x27;s default 365d TTL (30 days for Agent Assist traffic), higher value will be ignored and use default. Setting a value higher than that has no effect. A missing value or setting to 0 also means we use default TTL.
}

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents the settings related to security issues, such as data redaction and data retention. It may take hours for updates on the settings to propagate to all the related components and take effect.
  &quot;audioExportSettings&quot;: { # Settings for exporting audio. # Controls audio export settings for post-conversation analytics when ingesting audio to conversations via Participants.AnalyzeContent or Participants.StreamingAnalyzeContent. If retention_strategy is set to REMOVE_AFTER_CONVERSATION or audio_export_settings.gcs_bucket is empty, audio export is disabled. If audio export is enabled, audio is recorded and saved to audio_export_settings.gcs_bucket, subject to retention policy of audio_export_settings.gcs_bucket. This setting won&#x27;t effect audio input for implicit sessions via Sessions.DetectIntent or Sessions.StreamingDetectIntent.
    &quot;audioExportPattern&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Filename pattern for exported audio.
    &quot;audioFormat&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # File format for exported audio file. Currently only in telephony recordings.
    &quot;enableAudioRedaction&quot;: True or False, # Enable audio redaction if it is true.
    &quot;gcsBucket&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Cloud Storage bucket to export audio record to. Setting this field would grant the Storage Object Creator role to the Dialogflow Service Agent. API caller that tries to modify this field should have the permission of storage.buckets.setIamPolicy.
  },
  &quot;deidentifyTemplate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [DLP](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs) deidentify template name. Use this template to define de-identification configuration for the content. The `DLP De-identify Templates Reader` role is needed on the Dialogflow service identity service account (has the form `service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) for your agent&#x27;s project. If empty, Dialogflow replaces sensitive info with `[redacted]` text. The template name will have one of the following formats: `projects//locations//deidentifyTemplates/` OR `organizations//locations//deidentifyTemplates/` Note: `deidentify_template` must be located in the same region as the `SecuritySettings`.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human-readable name of the security settings, unique within the location.
  &quot;insightsExportSettings&quot;: { # Settings for exporting conversations to [Insights](https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/insights/docs). # Controls conversation exporting settings to Insights after conversation is completed. If retention_strategy is set to REMOVE_AFTER_CONVERSATION, Insights export is disabled no matter what you configure here.
    &quot;enableInsightsExport&quot;: True or False, # If enabled, we will automatically exports conversations to Insights and Insights runs its analyzers.
  },
  &quot;inspectTemplate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [DLP](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs) inspect template name. Use this template to define inspect base settings. The `DLP Inspect Templates Reader` role is needed on the Dialogflow service identity service account (has the form `service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) for your agent&#x27;s project. If empty, we use the default DLP inspect config. The template name will have one of the following formats: `projects//locations//inspectTemplates/` OR `organizations//locations//inspectTemplates/` Note: `inspect_template` must be located in the same region as the `SecuritySettings`.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name of the settings. Required for the SecuritySettingsService.UpdateSecuritySettings method. SecuritySettingsService.CreateSecuritySettings populates the name automatically. Format: `projects//locations//securitySettings/`.
  &quot;purgeDataTypes&quot;: [ # List of types of data to remove when retention settings triggers purge.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;redactionScope&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Defines the data for which Dialogflow applies redaction. Dialogflow does not redact data that it does not have access to â€“ for example, Cloud logging.
  &quot;redactionStrategy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strategy that defines how we do redaction.
  &quot;retentionWindowDays&quot;: 42, # Retains the data for the specified number of days. User must set a value lower than Dialogflow&#x27;s default 365d TTL (30 days for Agent Assist traffic), higher value will be ignored and use default. Setting a value higher than that has no effect.
