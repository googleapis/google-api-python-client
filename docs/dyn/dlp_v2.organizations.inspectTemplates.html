  <pre>Lists InspectTemplates.
See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-templates to learn more.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource name, for example projects/my-project-id or
organizations/my-org-id. (required)
  orderBy: string, Comma separated list of fields to order by,
followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case-insensitive,
default sorting order is ascending, redundant space characters are
insignificant.

Example: `name asc,update_time, create_time desc`

Supported fields are:

- `create_time`: corresponds to time the template was created.
- `update_time`: corresponds to time the template was last updated.
- `name`: corresponds to template&#x27;s name.
- `display_name`: corresponds to template&#x27;s display name.
  pageToken: string, Page token to continue retrieval. Comes from previous call
to `ListInspectTemplates`.
  locationId: string, The geographic location where inspection templates will be retrieved from.
Use `-` for all locations. Reserved for future extensions.
  pageSize: integer, Size of the page, can be limited by server. If zero server returns
a page of max size 100.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
