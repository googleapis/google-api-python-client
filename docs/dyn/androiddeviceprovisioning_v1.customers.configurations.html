<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new configuration. Once created, a customer can apply the configuration to devices.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The customer that manages the configuration. An API resource name in the format `customers/[CUSTOMER_ID]`. This field has custom validation in CreateConfigurationRequestValidator (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A configuration collects the provisioning options for Android devices. Each configuration combines the following: * The EMM device policy controller (DPC) installed on the devices. * EMM policies enforced on the devices. * Metadata displayed on the device to help users during setup. Customers can add as many configurations as they need. However, zero-touch enrollment works best when a customer sets a default configuration that&#x27;s applied to any new devices the organization purchases.
  &quot;companyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the organization. Zero-touch enrollment shows this organization name to device users during device provisioning.
  &quot;configurationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The ID of the configuration. Assigned by the server.
  &quot;configurationName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A short name that describes the configuration&#x27;s purpose. For example, _Sales team_ or _Temporary employees_. The zero-touch enrollment portal displays this name to IT admins.
  &quot;contactEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The email address that device users can contact to get help. Zero-touch enrollment shows this email address to device users before device provisioning. The value is validated on input.
  &quot;contactPhone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The telephone number that device users can call, using another device, to get help. Zero-touch enrollment shows this number to device users before device provisioning. Accepts numerals, spaces, the plus sign, hyphens, and parentheses.
  &quot;customMessage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A message, containing one or two sentences, to help device users get help or give them more details about what’s happening to their device. Zero-touch enrollment shows this message before the device is provisioned.
  &quot;dpcExtras&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The JSON-formatted EMM provisioning extras that are passed to the DPC.
  &quot;dpcResourcePath&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource name of the selected DPC (device policy controller) in the format `customers/[CUSTOMER_ID]/dpcs/*`. To list the supported DPCs, call `customers.dpcs.list`.
  &quot;isDefault&quot;: True or False, # Required. Whether this is the default configuration that zero-touch enrollment applies to any new devices the organization purchases in the future. Only one customer configuration can be the default. Setting this value to `true`, changes the previous default configuration&#x27;s `isDefault` value to `false`.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The API resource name in the format `customers/[CUSTOMER_ID]/configurations/[CONFIGURATION_ID]`. Assigned by the server.
