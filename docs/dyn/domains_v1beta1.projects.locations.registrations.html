<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Deletes a `Registration` resource. This method works on any `Registration` resource using [Subscription or Commitment billing](/domains/pricing#billing-models), provided that the resource was created at least 1 day in the past. For `Registration` resources using [Monthly billing](/domains/pricing#billing-models), this method works if: * `state` is `EXPORTED` with `expire_time` in the past * `state` is `REGISTRATION_FAILED` * `state` is `TRANSFER_FAILED` When an active registration is successfully deleted, you can continue to use the domain in [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) until it expires. The calling user becomes the domain's sole owner in Google Domains, and permissions for the domain are subsequently managed there. The domain does not renew automatically unless the new owner sets up billing in Google Domains.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#export">export(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Exports a `Registration` resource, such that it is no longer managed by Cloud Domains. When an active domain is successfully exported, you can continue to use the domain in [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) until it expires. The calling user becomes the domain's sole owner in Google Domains, and permissions for the domain are subsequently managed there.

<p class="firstline">Registers a new domain name and creates a corresponding `Registration` resource. Call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` first to check availability of the domain name and determine parameters like price that are needed to build a call to this method. A successful call creates a `Registration` resource in state `REGISTRATION_PENDING`, which resolves to `ACTIVE` within 1-2 minutes, indicating that the domain was successfully registered. If the resource ends up in state `REGISTRATION_FAILED`, it indicates that the domain was not registered successfully, and you can safely delete the resource and retry registration.</p>

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#transfer">transfer(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Transfers a domain name from another registrar to Cloud Domains. For domains already managed by [Google Domains](https://domains.google/), use `ImportDomain` instead. Before calling this method, go to the domain's current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain's transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to this method. A successful call creates a `Registration` resource in state `TRANSFER_PENDING`. It can take several days to complete the transfer process. The registrant can often speed up this process by approving the transfer through the current registrar, either by clicking a link in an email from the registrar or by visiting the registrar's website. A few minutes after transfer approval, the resource transitions to state `ACTIVE`, indicating that the transfer was successful. If the transfer is rejected or the request expires without being approved, the resource can end up in state `TRANSFER_FAILED`. If transfer fails, you can safely delete the resource and retry the transfer.</p>

  <pre>Updates a `Registration`&#x27;s contact settings. Some changes require confirmation by the domain&#x27;s registrant contact .

Args:
  registration: string, Required. The name of the `Registration` whose contact settings are being updated, in the format `projects/*/locations/*/registrations/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `ConfigureContactSettings` method.
  &quot;contactNotices&quot;: [ # The list of contact notices that the caller acknowledges. The notices needed here depend on the values specified in `contact_settings`.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;contactSettings&quot;: { # Defines the contact information associated with a `Registration`. [ICANN](https://icann.org/) requires all domain names to have associated contact information. The `registrant_contact` is considered the domain&#x27;s legal owner, and often the other contacts are identical. # Fields of the `ContactSettings` to update.
    &quot;adminContact&quot;: { # Details required for a contact associated with a `Registration`. # Required. The administrative contact for the `Registration`.
      &quot;email&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Email address of the contact.
      &quot;faxNumber&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Fax number of the contact in international format. For example, `&quot;+1-800-555-0123&quot;`.
      &quot;phoneNumber&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Phone number of the contact in international format. For example, `&quot;+1-800-555-0123&quot;`.
      &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Required. Postal address of the contact.
        &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
        &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.

        &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).

    { # The `Registration` resource facilitates managing and configuring domain name registrations. There are several ways to create a new `Registration` resource: To create a new `Registration` resource, find a suitable domain name by calling the `SearchDomains` method with a query to see available domain name options. After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to `RegisterDomain`. Another way to create a new `Registration` is to transfer an existing domain from another registrar. First, go to the current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain&#x27;s transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to `TransferDomain`. Finally, you can create a new `Registration` by importing an existing domain managed with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/). First, call `RetrieveImportableDomains` to list domains to which the calling user has sufficient access. Then call `ImportDomain` on any domain names you want to use with Cloud Domains.

  options_requestedPolicyVersion: integer, Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the `Registration` resources in a project.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project and location from which to list `Registration`s, specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*`. (required)
  filter: string, Filter expression to restrict the `Registration`s returned. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, a boolean, or an enum value. The comparison operator should be one of =, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, or : for prefix or wildcard matches. For example, to filter to a specific domain name, use an expression like `domainName=&quot;example.com&quot;`. You can also check for the existence of a field; for example, to find domains using custom DNS settings, use an expression like `dnsSettings.customDns:*`. You can also create compound filters by combining expressions with the `AND` and `OR` operators. For example, to find domains that are suspended or have specific issues flagged, use an expression like `(state=SUSPENDED) OR (issue:*)`.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of results to return.
  pageToken: string, When set to the `next_page_token` from a prior response, provides the next page of results.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response for the `ListRegistrations` method.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When present, there are more results to retrieve. Set `page_token` to this value on a subsequent call to get the next page of results.
  &quot;registrations&quot;: [ # A list of `Registration`s.
    { # The `Registration` resource facilitates managing and configuring domain name registrations. There are several ways to create a new `Registration` resource: To create a new `Registration` resource, find a suitable domain name by calling the `SearchDomains` method with a query to see available domain name options. After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to `RegisterDomain`. Another way to create a new `Registration` is to transfer an existing domain from another registrar. First, go to the current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain&#x27;s transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to `TransferDomain`. Finally, you can create a new `Registration` by importing an existing domain managed with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/). First, call `RetrieveImportableDomains` to list domains to which the calling user has sufficient access. Then call `ImportDomain` on any domain names you want to use with Cloud Domains.
      &quot;contactSettings&quot;: { # Defines the contact information associated with a `Registration`. [ICANN](https://icann.org/) requires all domain names to have associated contact information.

You cannot update these with the `UpdateRegistration` method. To update these settings, use the `ConfigureContactSettings` method.

{ # The `Registration` resource facilitates managing and configuring domain name registrations. There are several ways to create a new `Registration` resource: To create a new `Registration` resource, find a suitable domain name by calling the `SearchDomains` method with a query to see available domain name options. After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to `RegisterDomain`. Another way to create a new `Registration` is to transfer an existing domain from another registrar. First, go to the current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain&#x27;s transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to `TransferDomain`. Finally, you can create a new `Registration` by importing an existing domain managed with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/). First, call `RetrieveImportableDomains` to list domains to which the calling user has sufficient access. Then call `ImportDomain` on any domain names you want to use with Cloud Domains.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="register">register(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Registers a new domain name and creates a corresponding `Registration` resource. Call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` first to check availability of the domain name and determine parameters like price that are needed to build a call to this method. A successful call creates a `Registration` resource in state `REGISTRATION_PENDING`, which resolves to `ACTIVE` within 1-2 minutes, indicating that the domain was successfully registered. If the resource ends up in state `REGISTRATION_FAILED`, it indicates that the domain was not registered successfully, and you can safely delete the resource and retry registration.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the `Registration`. Must be in the format `projects/*/locations/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `RegisterDomain` method.

    &quot;A String&quot;,

  &quot;registration&quot;: { # The `Registration` resource facilitates managing and configuring domain name registrations. There are several ways to create a new `Registration` resource: To create a new `Registration` resource, find a suitable domain name by calling the `SearchDomains` method with a query to see available domain name options. After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to `RegisterDomain`. Another way to create a new `Registration` is to transfer an existing domain from another registrar. First, go to the current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain&#x27;s transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to `TransferDomain`. Finally, you can create a new `Registration` by importing an existing domain managed with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/). First, call `RetrieveImportableDomains` to list domains to which the calling user has sufficient access. Then call `ImportDomain` on any domain names you want to use with Cloud Domains. # Required. The complete `Registration` resource to be created.
    &quot;contactSettings&quot;: { # Defines the contact information associated with a `Registration`. [ICANN](https://icann.org/) requires all domain names to have associated contact information.

        &quot;phoneNumber&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Phone number of the contact in international format. For example, `&quot;+1-800-555-0123&quot;`.
        &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Required. Postal address of the contact.
          &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
          &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.

  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

  <pre>Transfers a domain name from another registrar to Cloud Domains. For domains already managed by [Google Domains](https://domains.google/), use `ImportDomain` instead. Before calling this method, go to the domain&#x27;s current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain&#x27;s transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to this method. A successful call creates a `Registration` resource in state `TRANSFER_PENDING`. It can take several days to complete the transfer process. The registrant can often speed up this process by approving the transfer through the current registrar, either by clicking a link in an email from the registrar or by visiting the registrar&#x27;s website. A few minutes after transfer approval, the resource transitions to state `ACTIVE`, indicating that the transfer was successful. If the transfer is rejected or the request expires without being approved, the resource can end up in state `TRANSFER_FAILED`. If transfer fails, you can safely delete the resource and retry the transfer.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the `Registration`. Must be in the format `projects/*/locations/*`. (required)

There are several ways to create a new `Registration` resource: To create a new `Registration` resource, find a suitable domain name by calling the `SearchDomains` method with a query to see available domain name options. After choosing a name, call `RetrieveRegisterParameters` to ensure availability and obtain information like pricing, which is needed to build a call to `RegisterDomain`. Another way to create a new `Registration` is to transfer an existing domain from another registrar. First, go to the current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain&#x27;s transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to `TransferDomain`. Finally, you can create a new `Registration` by importing an existing domain managed with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/). First, call `RetrieveImportableDomains` to list domains to which the calling user has sufficient access. Then call `ImportDomain` on any domain names you want to use with Cloud Domains. # Required. The complete `Registration` resource to be created. You can leave `registration.dns_settings` unset to import the domain&#x27;s current DNS configuration from its current registrar.

This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.

          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).

Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).

Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear.

In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
