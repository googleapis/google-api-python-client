Args:
  session: string, Required. The name of the session this query is sent to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//sessions/` or `projects//locations//agents//environments//sessions/`. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. It&#x27;s up to the API caller to choose an appropriate `Session ID`. It can be a random number or some type of session identifiers (preferably hashed). The length of the `Session ID` must not exceed 36 characters. For more information, see the [sessions guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/session). Note: Always use agent versions for production traffic. See [Versions and environments](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/version). (required)

If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice&#x27;s natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality).

Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values &lt; 0.25 or &gt; 4.0 will return an error.

        &quot;ssmlGender&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement.

      },
      &quot;volumeGainDb&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude.

  <pre>Fulfills a matched intent returned by MatchIntent. Must be called after MatchIntent, with input from MatchIntentResponse. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

Args:
  session: string, Required. The name of the session this query is sent to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//sessions/` or `projects//locations//agents//environments//sessions/`. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. It&#x27;s up to the API caller to choose an appropriate `Session ID`. It can be a random number or some type of session identifiers (preferably hashed). The length of the `Session ID` must not exceed 36 characters. For more information, see the [sessions guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/session). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request of FulfillIntent
  &quot;match&quot;: { # Represents one match result of MatchIntent. # The matched intent/event to fulfill.
    &quot;confidence&quot;: 3.14, # The confidence of this match. Values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). This value is for informational purpose only and is only used to help match the best intent within the classification threshold. This value may change for the same end-user expression at any time due to a model retraining or change in implementation.
    &quot;event&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The event that matched the query. Filled for `EVENT`, `NO_MATCH` and `NO_INPUT` match types.
    &quot;intent&quot;: { # An intent represents a user&#x27;s intent to interact with a conversational agent. You can provide information for the Dialogflow API to use to match user input to an intent by adding training phrases (i.e., examples of user input) to your intent. # The Intent that matched the query. Some, not all fields are filled in this message, including but not limited to: `name` and `display_name`. Only filled for `INTENT` match type.

      &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human-readable name of the intent, unique within the agent.
      &quot;isFallback&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether this is a fallback intent. Currently only default fallback intent is allowed in the agent, which is added upon agent creation. Adding training phrases to fallback intent is useful in the case of requests that are mistakenly matched, since training phrases assigned to fallback intents act as negative examples that triggers no-match event.
      &quot;labels&quot;: { # The key/value metadata to label an intent. Labels can contain lowercase letters, digits and the symbols &#x27;-&#x27; and &#x27;_&#x27;. International characters are allowed, including letters from unicase alphabets. Keys must start with a letter. Keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters and no more than 128 bytes. Prefix &quot;sys-&quot; is reserved for Dialogflow defined labels. Currently allowed Dialogflow defined labels include: * sys-head * sys-contextual The above labels do not require value. &quot;sys-head&quot; means the intent is a head intent. &quot;sys.contextual&quot; means the intent is a contextual intent.

Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `parameter_id` field is set.

In some scenarios, multiple output audio fields may be present in the response structure. In these cases, only the top-most-level audio output has content.

      &quot;speakingRate&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values &lt; 0.25 or &gt; 4.0 will return an error.

If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer substitutes a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.

If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there&#x27;s usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that.
