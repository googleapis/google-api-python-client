    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, connectorName=None, debugOptions_enableDebugging=None, mode=None, version=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes Item resource for the specified resource name. This API requires an admin or service account to execute. The service account used is the one whitelisted in the corresponding data source.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the item to delete. Format: datasources/{source_id}/items/{item_id} (required)
  connectorName: string, Name of connector making this call. Format: datasources/{source_id}/connectors/{ID}
  debugOptions_enableDebugging: boolean, If you are asked by Google to help with debugging, set this field. Otherwise, ignore this field.
  mode: string, Required. The RequestMode for this request.
    Allowed values
      UNSPECIFIED - Priority is not specified in the update request. Leaving priority unspecified results in an update failure.
      SYNCHRONOUS - For real-time updates.
      ASYNCHRONOUS - For changes that are executed after the response is sent back to the caller.
  version: string, Required. The incremented version of the item to delete from the index. The indexing system stores the version from the datasource as a byte string and compares the Item version in the index to the version of the queued Item using lexical ordering. Cloud Search Indexing won&#x27;t delete any queued item with a version value that is less than or equal to the version of the currently indexed item. The maximum length for this field is 1024 bytes.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Fields with no provided values are cleared out in the Cloud Search index. This API requires an admin or service account to execute. The service account used is the one whitelisted in the corresponding data source.

Args:
  name: string, Name of the Item. Format: datasources/{source_id}/items/{item_id} This is a required field. The maximum length is 1536 characters. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

Args:
  name: string, Name of the Data Source to list Items. Format: datasources/{source_id} (required)
  brief: boolean, When set to true, the indexing system only populates the following fields: name, version, queue. metadata.hash, metadata.title, metadata.sourceRepositoryURL, metadata.objectType, metadata.createTime, metadata.updateTime, metadata.contentLanguage, metadata.mimeType, structured_data.hash, content.hash, itemType, itemStatus.code, itemStatus.processingError.code, itemStatus.repositoryError.type, If this value is false, then all the fields are populated in Item.
  connectorName: string, Name of connector making this call. Format: datasources/{source_id}/connectors/{ID}
  debugOptions_enableDebugging: boolean, If you are asked by Google to help with debugging, set this field. Otherwise, ignore this field.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of items to fetch in a request. The max value is 1000 when brief is true. The max value is 10 if brief is false. The default value is 10
  pageToken: string, The next_page_token value returned from a previous List request, if any.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="unreserve">unreserve(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Unreserves all items from a queue, making them all eligible to be polled. This method is useful for resetting the indexing queue after a connector has been restarted. This API requires an admin or service account to execute. The service account used is the one whitelisted in the corresponding data source.

Args:
  name: string, Name of the Data Source to unreserve all items. Format: datasources/{source_id} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;connectorName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of connector making this call. Format: datasources/{source_id}/connectors/{ID}
  &quot;debugOptions&quot;: { # Shared request debug options for all cloudsearch RPC methods. # Common debug options.
    &quot;enableDebugging&quot;: True or False, # If you are asked by Google to help with debugging, set this field. Otherwise, ignore this field.
  },
  &quot;queue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of a queue to unreserve items from.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

<div class="method">

  <pre>Creates an upload session for uploading item content. For items smaller than 100 KB, it&#x27;s easier to embed the content inline within an index request.
