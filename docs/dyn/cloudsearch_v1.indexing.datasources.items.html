    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, connectorName=None, debugOptions_enableDebugging=None, mode=None, version=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes Item resource for the specified resource name. This API requires an admin or service account to execute. The service account used is the one whitelisted in the corresponding data source.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the item to delete. Format: datasources/{source_id}/items/{item_id} (required)
  connectorName: string, The name of connector making this call. Format: datasources/{source_id}/connectors/{ID}
  debugOptions_enableDebugging: boolean, If you are asked by Google to help with debugging, set this field. Otherwise, ignore this field.
  mode: string, Required. The RequestMode for this request.
    Allowed values
      UNSPECIFIED - The priority is not specified in the update request. Leaving priority unspecified results in an update failure.
      SYNCHRONOUS - For real-time updates.
      ASYNCHRONOUS - For changes that are executed after the response is sent back to the caller.
  version: string, Required. The incremented version of the item to delete from the index. The indexing system stores the version from the datasource as a byte string and compares the Item version in the index to the version of the queued Item using lexical ordering. Cloud Search Indexing won&#x27;t delete any queued item with a version value that is less than or equal to the version of the currently indexed item. The maximum length for this field is 1024 bytes. For information on how item version affects the deletion process, refer to [Handle revisions after manual deletes](https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/operations).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

  <pre>Updates Item ACL, metadata, and content. It will insert the Item if it does not exist. This method does not support partial updates. Fields with no provided values are cleared out in the Cloud Search index. This API requires an admin or service account to execute. The service account used is the one whitelisted in the corresponding data source.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the Item. Format: datasources/{source_id}/items/{item_id} This is a required field. The maximum length is 1536 characters. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="unreserve">unreserve(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Unreserves all items from a queue, making them all eligible to be polled. This method is useful for resetting the indexing queue after a connector has been restarted. This API requires an admin or service account to execute. The service account used is the one whitelisted in the corresponding data source.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the Data Source to unreserve all items. Format: datasources/{source_id} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;connectorName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of connector making this call. Format: datasources/{source_id}/connectors/{ID}
  &quot;debugOptions&quot;: { # Shared request debug options for all cloudsearch RPC methods. # Common debug options.
    &quot;enableDebugging&quot;: True or False, # If you are asked by Google to help with debugging, set this field. Otherwise, ignore this field.

It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
