<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addItems">addItems(addressGroup, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds items to an address group.

Args:
  addressGroup: string, Required. A name of the AddressGroup to add items to. Must be in the format `projects|organization/*/locations/{location}/addressGroups/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request used by the AddAddressGroupItems method.
  &quot;items&quot;: [ # Required. List of items to add.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body=None, requestId=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates parameters of an address group.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the AddressGroup resource. It matches pattern `projects/*/locations/{location}/addressGroups/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # AddressGroup is a resource that specifies how a collection of IP/DNS used in Firewall Policy.
  &quot;capacity&quot;: 42, # Required. Capacity of the Address Group
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Free-text description of the resource.
  &quot;items&quot;: [ # Optional. List of items.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Set of label tags associated with the AddressGroup resource.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Name of the AddressGroup resource. It matches pattern `projects/*/locations/{location}/addressGroups/`.
  &quot;purpose&quot;: [ # Optional. List of supported purposes of the Address Group.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this resource.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The type of the Address Group. Possible values are &quot;IPv4&quot; or &quot;IPV6&quot;.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was updated.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the AddressGroup resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
