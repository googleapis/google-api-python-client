  <pre>Requests the creation of a new WebApp in the specified FirebaseProject. The result of this call is an `Operation` which can be used to track the provisioning process. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call `DeleteOperation`.

Args:
  parent: string, The resource name of the parent FirebaseProject in which to create a WebApp, in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER/webApps Refer to the `FirebaseProject` [`name`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.name) field for details about PROJECT_IDENTIFIER values. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Details of a Firebase App for the web.
  &quot;apiKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The globally unique, Google-assigned identifier (UID) for the Firebase API key associated with the `WebApp`. Be aware that this value is the UID of the API key, _not_ the [`keyString`](https://cloud.google.com/api-keys/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.keys#Key.FIELDS.key_string) of the API key. The `keyString` is the value that can be found in the App&#x27;s [configuration artifact](../../rest/v1beta1/projects.webApps/getConfig). If `api_key_id` is not set in requests to [`webApps.Create`](../../rest/v1beta1/projects.webApps/create), then Firebase automatically associates an `api_key_id` with the `WebApp`. This auto-associated key may be an existing valid key or, if no valid key exists, a new one will be provisioned. In patch requests, `api_key_id` cannot be set to an empty value, and the new UID must have no restrictions or only have restrictions that are valid for the associated `WebApp`. We recommend using the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) to manage API keys.
  &quot;appId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. The globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `WebApp`. This identifier should be treated as an opaque token, as the data format is not specified.

Learn more about `etag` in Google&#x27;s [AIP-154 standard](https://google.aip.dev/154#declarative-friendly-resources). This etag is strongly validated.
  &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp of when the App will be considered expired and cannot be undeleted. This value is only provided if the App is in the `DELETED` state.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the WebApp, in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER /webApps/APP_ID * PROJECT_IDENTIFIER: the parent Project&#x27;s [`ProjectNumber`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_number) ***(recommended)*** or its [`ProjectId`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_id). Learn more about using project identifiers in Google&#x27;s [AIP 2510 standard](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510). Note that the value for PROJECT_IDENTIFIER in any response body will be the `ProjectId`. * APP_ID: the globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the App (see [`appId`](../projects.webApps#WebApp.FIELDS.app_id)).
  &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. A user-assigned unique identifier of the parent FirebaseProject for the `WebApp`.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The lifecycle state of the App.
  &quot;webId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. A unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `WebApp`.

  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

Learn more about this ID and Google Analytics web streams in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153). To generate a `measurementId` and link the `WebApp` with a Google Analytics web stream, call [`AddGoogleAnalytics`](../../v1beta1/projects/addGoogleAnalytics). For apps using the Firebase JavaScript SDK v7.20.0 and later, Firebase dynamically fetches the `measurementId` when your app initializes Analytics.

  &quot;webId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. A unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `WebApp`. This identifier is only used to populate the `namespace` value for the `WebApp`. For most use cases, use `appId` to identify or reference the App. The `webId` value is only unique within a `FirebaseProject` and its associated Apps.
}

  updateMask: string, Specifies which fields of the WebApp to update. Note that the following fields are immutable: `name`, `app_id`, and `project_id`. To update `state`, use any of the following endpoints: RemoveWebApp or UndeleteWebApp.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Details of a Firebase App for the web.
  &quot;apiKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The globally unique, Google-assigned identifier (UID) for the Firebase API key associated with the `WebApp`. Be aware that this value is the UID of the API key, _not_ the [`keyString`](https://cloud.google.com/api-keys/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.keys#Key.FIELDS.key_string) of the API key. The `keyString` is the value that can be found in the App&#x27;s [configuration artifact](../../rest/v1beta1/projects.webApps/getConfig). If `api_key_id` is not set in requests to [`webApps.Create`](../../rest/v1beta1/projects.webApps/create), then Firebase automatically associates an `api_key_id` with the `WebApp`. This auto-associated key may be an existing valid key or, if no valid key exists, a new one will be provisioned. In patch requests, `api_key_id` cannot be set to an empty value, and the new UID must have no restrictions or only have restrictions that are valid for the associated `WebApp`. We recommend using the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) to manage API keys.
  &quot;appId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. The globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `WebApp`. This identifier should be treated as an opaque token, as the data format is not specified.
  &quot;appUrls&quot;: [ # The URLs where the `WebApp` is hosted.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The user-assigned display name for the `WebApp`.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and it may be sent with update requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. Learn more about `etag` in Google&#x27;s [AIP-154 standard](https://google.aip.dev/154#declarative-friendly-resources). This etag is strongly validated.
  &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp of when the App will be considered expired and cannot be undeleted. This value is only provided if the App is in the `DELETED` state.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the WebApp, in the format: projects/PROJECT_IDENTIFIER /webApps/APP_ID * PROJECT_IDENTIFIER: the parent Project&#x27;s [`ProjectNumber`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_number) ***(recommended)*** or its [`ProjectId`](../projects#FirebaseProject.FIELDS.project_id). Learn more about using project identifiers in Google&#x27;s [AIP 2510 standard](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510). Note that the value for PROJECT_IDENTIFIER in any response body will be the `ProjectId`. * APP_ID: the globally unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the App (see [`appId`](../projects.webApps#WebApp.FIELDS.app_id)).
  &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. A user-assigned unique identifier of the parent FirebaseProject for the `WebApp`.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The lifecycle state of the App.
  &quot;webId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. A unique, Firebase-assigned identifier for the `WebApp`. This identifier is only used to populate the `namespace` value for the `WebApp`. For most use cases, use `appId` to identify or reference the App. The `webId` value is only unique within a `FirebaseProject` and its associated Apps.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="remove">remove(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Removes the specified WebApp from the FirebaseProject.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the WebApp, in the format: projects/ PROJECT_IDENTIFIER/webApps/APP_ID Since an APP_ID is a unique identifier, the Unique Resource from Sub-Collection access pattern may be used here, in the format: projects/-/webApps/APP_ID Refer to the WebApp [name](../projects.webApps#WebApp.FIELDS.name) field for details about PROJECT_IDENTIFIER and APP_ID values. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;allowMissing&quot;: True or False, # If set to true, and the App is not found, the request will succeed but no action will be taken on the server.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Checksum provided in the WebApp resource. If provided, this checksum ensures that the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;immediate&quot;: True or False, # Determines whether to _immediately_ delete the WebApp. If set to true, the App is immediately deleted from the Project and cannot be restored to the Project. If not set, defaults to false, which means the App will be set to expire in 30 days. Within the 30 days, the App may be restored to the Project using UndeleteWebApp
  &quot;validateOnly&quot;: True or False, # If set to true, the request is only validated. The App will _not_ be removed.
