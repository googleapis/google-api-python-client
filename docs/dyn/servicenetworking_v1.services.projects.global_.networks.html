  <pre>Service producers use this method to get the configuration of their connection including the import/export of custom routes and subnetwork routes with public IP.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the consumer config to retrieve in the format: `services/{service}/projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`. {service} is the peering service that is managing connectivity for the service producer&#x27;s organization.

(required)
  includeUsedIpRanges: boolean, Optional. When true, include the used IP ranges as part of the GetConsumerConfig output. This includes routes created inside the service networking network, consumer network, peers of the consumer network, and reserved ranges inside the service networking network. By default, this is false
