Once the guardian accepts the invitation, their `state` will change to `COMPLETED` and they will start receiving guardian notifications.

Failing to set these fields, or setting any other fields in the request, will result in an error. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the current user does not have permission to manage guardians, if the guardian in question has already rejected too many requests for that student, if guardians are not enabled for the domain in question, or for other access errors. * `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` if the student or guardian has exceeded the guardian link limit. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the guardian email address is not valid (for example, if it is too long), or if the format of the student ID provided cannot be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `user_id` from this API).
