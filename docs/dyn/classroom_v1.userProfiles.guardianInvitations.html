<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(studentId, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a guardian invitation, and sends an email to the guardian asking
them to confirm that they are the student's guardian.

Once the guardian accepts the invitation, their `state` will change to
`COMPLETED` and they will start receiving guardian notifications. A
`Guardian` resource will also be created to represent the active guardian.

The request object must have the `student_id` and
`invited_email_address` fields set. Failing to set these fields, or
setting any other fields in the request, will result in an error.

This method returns the following error codes:

* `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the current user does not have permission to
  manage guardians, if the guardian in question has already rejected
  too many requests for that student, if guardians are not enabled for the
  domain in question, or for other access errors.
* `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` if the student or guardian has exceeded the guardian
  link limit.
* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the guardian email address is not valid (for
  example, if it is too long), or if the format of the student ID provided
  cannot be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `user_id` from
  this API). This error will also be returned if read-only fields are set,
  or if the `state` field is set to to a value other than `PENDING`.
* `NOT_FOUND` if the student ID provided is a valid student ID, but
  Classroom has no record of that student.
* `ALREADY_EXISTS` if there is already a pending guardian invitation for
  the student and `invited_email_address` provided, or if the provided
  `invited_email_address` matches the Google account of an existing
  `Guardian` for this user.

Args:
  studentId: string, ID of the student (in standard format) (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An invitation to become the guardian of a specified user, sent to a specified
      # email address.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(studentId, invitationId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns a specific guardian invitation.

This method returns the following error codes:

* `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to view
  guardian invitations for the student identified by the `student_id`, if
  guardians are not enabled for the domain in question, or for other
  access errors.
* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a `student_id` is specified, but its format cannot
  be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `student_id` from the
  API, nor the literal string `me`).
* `NOT_FOUND` if Classroom cannot find any record of the given student or
  `invitation_id`. May also be returned if the student exists, but the
  requesting user does not have access to see that student.

  or for other access errors.
* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a `student_id` is specified, but its format cannot
