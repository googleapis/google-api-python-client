Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the organization for which the score needs to be computed in the following format: `organizations/{org}/securityAssessmentResults` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for BatchComputeSecurityAssessmentResults.
  &quot;include&quot;: { # An array of resource messages. # Include only these resources.
    &quot;resources&quot;: [ # Required. The array of resources. For Apigee, the proxies are resources.

  &quot;pageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A page token, received from a previous `BatchComputeSecurityAssessmentResults` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.
  &quot;profile&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Name of the profile that is used for computation.
