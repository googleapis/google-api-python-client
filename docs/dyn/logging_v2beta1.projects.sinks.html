<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(projectName, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a sink.

Args:
  projectName: string, The resource name of the project in which to create the sink. Example: `"projects/my-project-id"`. The new sink must be provided in the request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a sink used to export log entries outside Cloud Logging.
    "filter": "A String", # An [advanced logs filter](/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters) that defines the log entries to be exported. The filter must be consistent with the log entry format designed by the `outputVersionFormat` parameter, regardless of the format of the log entry that was originally written to Cloud Logging. Example: `"logName:syslog AND severity>=ERROR"`.
    "destination": "A String", # The export destination. See [Exporting Logs With Sinks](/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs). Examples: `"storage.googleapis.com/a-bucket"`, `"bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/a-project-id/datasets/a-dataset"`.
    "name": "A String", # Required. The client-assigned sink identifier. Example: `"my-severe-errors-to-pubsub"`. Sink identifiers are limited to 1000 characters and can include only the following characters: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and the special characters `_-.`.
    "outputVersionFormat": "A String", # The log entry version used when exporting log entries from this sink. This version does not have to correspond to the version of the log entry when it was written to Cloud Logging.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Describes a sink used to export log entries outside Cloud Logging.
      "filter": "A String", # An [advanced logs filter](/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters) that defines the log entries to be exported. The filter must be consistent with the log entry format designed by the `outputVersionFormat` parameter, regardless of the format of the log entry that was originally written to Cloud Logging.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(sinkName, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a sink.

Args:
  sinkName: string, The resource name of the sink to delete. Example: `"projects/my-project-id/sinks/my-sink-id"`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(sinkName, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a sink.

Args:
  sinkName: string, The resource name of the sink to return. Example: `"projects/my-project-id/sinks/my-sink-id"`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(projectName, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists sinks.

Args:
  projectName: string, Required. The resource name of the project containing the sinks. Example: `"projects/my-logging-project"`, `"projects/01234567890"`. (required)
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request. Fewer results might be returned. You must check for the `nextPageToken` result to determine if additional results are available, which you can retrieve by passing the `nextPageToken` value in the `pageToken` parameter to the next request.
  pageToken: string, Optional. If the `pageToken` request parameter is supplied, then the next page of results in the set are retrieved.
