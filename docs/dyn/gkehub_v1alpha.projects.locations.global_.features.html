  <pre>Adds a new Feature.

Args:
  parent: string, The parent (project and location) where the Feature will be created. Specified in the format `projects/*/locations/global`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Feature represents the settings and status of any Hub Feature.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the Feature resource was created.
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the Feature resource was deleted.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # GCP labels for this Feature.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;membershipSpecs&quot;: { # Optional. Membership-specific configuration for this Feature. If this Feature does not support any per-Membership configuration, this field may be unused. The keys indicate which Membership the configuration is for, in the form: projects/{p}/locations/{l}/memberships/{m} Where {p} is the project, {l} is a valid location and {m} is a valid Membership in this project at that location. {p} WILL match the Feature&#x27;s project. {p} will always be returned as the project number, but the project ID is also accepted during input. If the same Membership is specified in the map twice (using the project ID form, and the project number form), exactly ONE of the entries will be saved, with no guarantees as to which. For this reason, it is recommended the same format be used for all entries when mutating a Feature.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Features in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, The parent (project and location) where the Features will be listed. Specified in the format `projects/*/locations/global`. (required)
  filter: string, Lists Features that match the filter expression, following the syntax outlined in https://google.aip.dev/160. Examples: - Feature with the name &quot;servicemesh&quot; in project &quot;foo-proj&quot;: name = &quot;projects/foo-proj/locations/global/features/servicemesh&quot; - Features that have a label called `foo`: labels.foo:* - Features that have a label called `foo` whose value is `bar`: labels.foo = bar
  orderBy: string, One or more fields to compare and use to sort the output. See https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering.
  pageSize: integer, When requesting a &#x27;page&#x27; of resources, `page_size` specifies number of resources to return. If unspecified or set to 0, all resources will be returned.
  pageToken: string, Token returned by previous call to `ListFeatures` which specifies the position in the list from where to continue listing the resources.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for the `GkeHub.ListFeatures` method.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A token to request the next page of resources from the `ListFeatures` method. The value of an empty string means that there are no more resources to return.
  &quot;resources&quot;: [ # The list of matching Features
    { # Feature represents the settings and status of any Hub Feature.
      &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the Feature resource was created.

If the same Membership is specified in the map twice (using the project ID form, and the project number form), exactly ONE of the entries will be saved, with no guarantees as to which.

  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
