  <pre>Creates new notes in batch.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project in the form of `projects/[PROJECT_ID]`, under which the notes are to be created. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to create notes in batch.
  &quot;notes&quot;: { # Required. The notes to create, the key is expected to be the note ID. Max allowed length is 1000.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: { # A type of analysis that can be done for a resource.
      &quot;attestationAuthority&quot;: { # Note kind that represents a logical attestation &quot;role&quot; or &quot;authority&quot;. For example, an organization might have one `Authority` for &quot;QA&quot; and one for &quot;build&quot;. This note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they don&#x27;t all live in the same project. # A note describing an attestation role.
        &quot;hint&quot;: { # This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of the authority. Because the name of a note acts as its resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes) from &quot;readable&quot; names more suitable for debug output. Note that these hints should not be used to look up authorities in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up attestations to verify. # Hint hints at the purpose of the attestation authority.
          &quot;humanReadableName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human readable name of this attestation authority, for example &quot;qa&quot;.
        },
      },
      &quot;baseImage&quot;: { # Basis describes the base image portion (Note) of the DockerImage relationship. Linked occurrences are derived from this or an equivalent image via: FROM Or an equivalent reference, e.g. a tag of the resource_url. # A note describing a base image.
        &quot;fingerprint&quot;: { # A set of properties that uniquely identify a given Docker image. # Required. Immutable. The fingerprint of the base image.
          &quot;v1Name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The layer ID of the final layer in the Docker image&#x27;s v1 representation.
          &quot;v2Blob&quot;: [ # Required. The ordered list of v2 blobs that represent a given image.
            &quot;A String&quot;,

        },
        &quot;resourceUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The resource_url for the resource representing the basis of associated occurrence images.

This could be either an ID for the key stored in `public_key` (such as the ID or fingerprint for a PGP key, or the CN for a cert), or a reference to an external key (such as a reference to a key in Cloud Key Management Service).
          &quot;keyType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of the key, either stored in `public_key` or referenced in `key_id`.
          &quot;publicKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Public key of the builder which can be used to verify that the related findings are valid and unchanged. If `key_type` is empty, this defaults to PEM encoded public keys. This field may be empty if `key_id` references an external key. For Cloud Build based signatures, this is a PEM encoded public key. To verify the Cloud Build signature, place the contents of this field into a file (public.pem). The signature field is base64-decoded into its binary representation in signature.bin, and the provenance bytes from `BuildDetails` are base64-decoded into a binary representation in signed.bin. OpenSSL can then verify the signature: `openssl sha256 -verify public.pem -signature signature.bin signed.bin`

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project in the form of `projects/[PROJECT_ID]`, under which the note is to be created. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

For example, an organization might have one `Authority` for &quot;QA&quot; and one for &quot;build&quot;. This note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they don&#x27;t all live in the same project. # A note describing an attestation role.
    &quot;hint&quot;: { # This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of the authority. Because the name of a note acts as its resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes) from &quot;readable&quot; names more suitable for debug output. Note that these hints should not be used to look up authorities in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up attestations to verify. # Hint hints at the purpose of the attestation authority.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists notes for the specified project.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project to list notes for in the form of `projects/[PROJECT_ID]`. (required)
  filter: string, The filter expression.
  pageSize: integer, Number of notes to return in the list. Must be positive. Max allowed page size is 1000. If not specified, page size defaults to 20.
  pageToken: string, Token to provide to skip to a particular spot in the list.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response for listing notes.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The next pagination token in the list response. It should be used as `page_token` for the following request. An empty value means no more results.

For example, an organization might have one `Authority` for &quot;QA&quot; and one for &quot;build&quot;. This note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they don&#x27;t all live in the same project. # A note describing an attestation role.
        &quot;hint&quot;: { # This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of the authority. Because the name of a note acts as its resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes) from &quot;readable&quot; names more suitable for debug output. Note that these hints should not be used to look up authorities in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up attestations to verify. # Hint hints at the purpose of the attestation authority.
          &quot;humanReadableName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human readable name of this attestation authority, for example &quot;qa&quot;.
