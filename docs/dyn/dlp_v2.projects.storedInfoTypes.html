Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. The format of this value varies depending on the scope of the request (project or organization) and whether you have [specified a processing location](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/specifying-location): + Projects scope, location specified: `projects/`PROJECT_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID + Projects scope, no location specified (defaults to global): `projects/`PROJECT_ID + Organizations scope, location specified: `organizations/`ORG_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID + Organizations scope, no location specified (defaults to global): `organizations/`ORG_ID The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a stored infoType. See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-stored-infotypes to learn more.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Resource name of the organization and storedInfoType to be deleted, for example `organizations/433245324/storedInfoTypes/432452342` or projects/project-id/storedInfoTypes/432452342. (required)
