<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists stored infoTypes.
See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-stored-infotypes to
learn more.

Args:
  parent: string, The parent resource name, for example projects/my-project-id or
organizations/my-org-id. (required)
  orderBy: string, Optional comma separated list of fields to order by,
followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case-insensitive,
default sorting order is ascending, redundant space characters are
insignificant.

Example: `name asc, display_name, create_time desc`

Supported fields are:

- `create_time`: corresponds to time the most recent version of the
resource was created.
- `state`: corresponds to the state of the resource.
- `name`: corresponds to resource name.
- `display_name`: corresponds to info type's display name.
  pageSize: integer, Optional size of the page, can be limited by server. If zero server returns
a page of max size 100.
  pageToken: string, Optional page token to continue retrieval. Comes from previous call
to `ListStoredInfoTypes`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for ListStoredInfoTypes.
