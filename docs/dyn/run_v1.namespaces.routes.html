  <pre>List routes.

Args:
  parent: string, The namespace from which the routes should be listed.
For Cloud Run (fully managed), replace {namespace_id} with the project ID
or number. (required)

start. Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  includeUninitialized: boolean, Not currently used by Cloud Run.

Send this in a query string format. i.e. &#x27;metadata.name%3Dlorem&#x27;.
Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  continue: string, Optional encoded string to continue paging.
  limit: integer, The maximum number of records that should be returned.
  watch: boolean, Flag that indicates that the client expects to watch this resource as well.
Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  labelSelector: string, Allows to filter resources based on a label. Supported operations are
=, !=, exists, in, and notIn.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
