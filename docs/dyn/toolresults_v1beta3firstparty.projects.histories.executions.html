  <pre>Creates an Execution.

The returned Execution will have the id set.

May return any of the following canonical error codes:

- PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to write to project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - NOT_FOUND - if the containing History does not exist

Args:
  projectId: string, A Project id.

Required. (required)
  historyId: string, A History id.

Required. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An Execution represents a collection of Steps. For instance, it could represent: - a mobile test executed across a range of device configurations - a jenkins job with a build step followed by a test step
      # 
      # The maximum size of an execution message is 1 MiB.
      # 
      # An Execution can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which point it becomes immutable.

It is encoded using the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. It is encoded assuming all minutes are 60 seconds long, i.e. leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation. Range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from RFC 3339 date strings.

        # Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL)); timestamp.set_nanos(0);

        # # JSON Mapping
        #
        # In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z" where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
        #
        # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
        #
        # In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString] method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted to this format using [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.

          # In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z" where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
          #
          # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.

The executions are sorted by creation_time in descending order. The execution_id key will be used to order the executions with the same creation_time.

May return any of the following canonical error codes:

- PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to read project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - NOT_FOUND - if the containing History does not exist

Args:
  projectId: string, A Project id.

Required. (required)

        # In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format.

The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
        #
        # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
