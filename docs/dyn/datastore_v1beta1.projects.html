  <pre>Exports a copy of all or a subset of entities from Google Cloud Datastore
to another storage system, such as Google Cloud Storage. Recent updates to
entities may not be reflected in the export. The export occurs in the
background and its progress can be monitored and managed via the
Operation resource that is created. The output of an export may only be
used once the associated operation is done. If an export operation is
cancelled before completion it may leave partial data behind in Google
Cloud Storage.

Args:
  projectId: string, Project ID against which to make the request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for
      # google.datastore.admin.v1beta1.DatastoreAdmin.ExportEntities.
    "outputUrlPrefix": "A String", # Location for the export metadata and data files.
        #

        # form: `gs://BUCKET_NAME[/NAMESPACE_PATH]`, where `BUCKET_NAME` is the
        # name of the Cloud Storage bucket and `NAMESPACE_PATH` is an optional Cloud
        # Storage namespace path (this is not a Cloud Datastore namespace). For more
        # information about Cloud Storage namespace paths, see

        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
        # message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
