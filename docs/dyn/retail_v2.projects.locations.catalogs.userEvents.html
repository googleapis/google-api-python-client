  <pre>Writes a single user event from the browser. This uses a GET request to due to browser restriction of POST-ing to a 3rd party domain. This method is used only by the Retail API JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager. Users should not call this method directly.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent catalog name, such as `projects/1234/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`. (required)
  ets: string, The event timestamp in milliseconds. This prevents browser caching of otherwise identical get requests. The name is abbreviated to reduce the payload bytes.
  uri: string, The URL including cgi-parameters but excluding the hash fragment with a length limit of 5,000 characters. This is often more useful than the referer URL, because many browsers only send the domain for 3rd party requests.
  userEvent: string, Required. URL encoded UserEvent proto with a length limit of 2,000,000 characters.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for payload formats that can&#x27;t be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or an HTML page. This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example: message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id = 1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
  &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP Content-Type header value specifying the content type of the body.
  &quot;data&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP request/response body as raw binary.
  &quot;extensions&quot;: [ # Application specific response metadata. Must be set in the first response for streaming APIs.

This field is required for the following event types: * `add-to-cart` * `detail-page-view` * `purchase-complete` In a `search` event, this field represents the products returned to the end user on the current page (the end user may have not finished browsing the whole page yet).

Specifying this will delete all events associated with a visitor. * `userId`: Double quoted string. Specifying this will delete all events associated with a user. Examples: * Deleting all events in a time range: `eventTime &gt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z&quot; eventTime &lt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z&quot;` * Deleting specific eventType in time range: `eventTime &gt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z&quot; eventType = &quot;detail-page-view&quot;` * Deleting all events for a specific visitor: `visitorId = &quot;visitor1024&quot;` The filtering fields are assumed to have an implicit AND.
