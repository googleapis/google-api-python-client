<p class="firstline">Imports resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases where this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to load data. Every resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID. Each resource is stored using the supplied ID regardless of the enable_update_create setting on the FHIR store. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and Cloud Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. The import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of the disable_referential_integrity setting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with arbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but if the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to be imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates referential integrity. The import process does not trigger Pub/Sub notification or BigQuery streaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store. If a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent version of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical version, regardless of the disable_resource_versioning setting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import, it's possible that successfully imported resources will be overwritten more than once. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one resource with that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the contents it will have. The operation result counters do not count duplicate IDs as an error and count one success for each resource in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data organized in bundles produced by Patient-everything where each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner that might be referred to by many patients. If some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported resources are not rolled back. The location and format of the input data is specified by the parameters in ImportResourcesRequest. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the `BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method ignores the `Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected, and does not apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction bundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed as a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten. The bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as provided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As an example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a FHIR search or Patient-everything operation. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). Otherwise, when the operation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse is returned in the response field. The metadata field type for this operation is OperationMetadata.</p>

  <pre>Creates a new FHIR store within the parent dataset.

Args:
  parent: string, The name of the dataset this FHIR store belongs to. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a FHIR store.
  &quot;complexDataTypeReferenceParsing&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources.
  &quot;defaultSearchHandlingStrict&quot;: True or False, # If true, overrides the default search behavior for this FHIR store to `handling=strict` which returns an error for unrecognized search parameters. If false, uses the FHIR specification default `handling=lenient` which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header `Prefer: handling=strict` or `Prefer: handling=lenient`.
  &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist.
  &quot;disableResourceVersioning&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions.
  &quot;enableUpdateCreate&quot;: True or False, # Whether this FHIR store has the [updateCreate capability](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate). This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-existent resource return errors. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62} Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63} No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Resource name of the FHIR store, of the form `projects/{project_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}`.
  &quot;notificationConfig&quot;: { # Specifies where to send notifications upon changes to a data store. # If non-empty, publish all resource modifications of this FHIR store to this destination. The Pub/Sub message attributes contain a map with a string describing the action that has triggered the notification. For example, &quot;action&quot;:&quot;CreateResource&quot;.
    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can&#x27;t be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren&#x27;t submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see [Configuring Pub/Sub notifications](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub) for specific details.
  },
  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types. For example, &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data is not streamed. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors are logged to Cloud Logging. For more information, see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).
        &quot;datasetUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # BigQuery URI to an existing dataset, up to 2000 characters long, in the format `bq://projectId.bqDatasetId`.
        &quot;force&quot;: True or False, # If this flag is `TRUE`, all tables are deleted from the dataset before the new exported tables are written. If the flag is not set and the destination dataset contains tables, the export call returns an error. If `write_disposition` is specified, this parameter is ignored. force=false is equivalent to write_disposition=WRITE_EMPTY and force=true is equivalent to write_disposition=WRITE_TRUNCATE.
        &quot;schemaConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for the FHIR BigQuery schema. Determines how the server generates the schema. # The configuration for the exported BigQuery schema.
          &quot;lastUpdatedPartitionConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for FHIR BigQuery time-partitioned tables. # The configuration for exported BigQuery tables to be partitioned by FHIR resource&#x27;s last updated time column.
            &quot;expirationMs&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for a partition.
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Type of partitioning.
          },
          &quot;recursiveStructureDepth&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The depth for all recursive structures in the output analytics schema. For example, `concept` in the CodeSystem resource is a recursive structure; when the depth is 2, the CodeSystem table will have a column called `concept.concept` but not `concept.concept.concept`. If not specified or set to 0, the server will use the default value 2. The maximum depth allowed is 5.
          &quot;schemaType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the output schema type. Schema type is required.
        },
        &quot;writeDisposition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Determines if existing data in the destination dataset is overwritten, appended to, or not written if the tables contain data. If a write_disposition is specified, the `force` parameter is ignored.
      },
      &quot;deidentifiedStoreDestination&quot;: { # Contains configuration for streaming de-identified FHIR export. # The destination FHIR store for de-identified resources. After this field is added, all subsequent creates/updates/patches to the source store will be de-identified using the provided configuration and applied to the destination store. Importing resources to the source store will not trigger the streaming. If the source store already contains resources when this option is enabled, those resources will not be copied to the destination store unless they are subsequently updated. This may result in invalid references in the destination store. Before adding this config, you must grant the healthcare.fhirResources.update permission on the destination store to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/permissions-healthcare-api-gcp-products#the_cloud_healthcare_service_agent). The destination store must set enable_update_create to true. The destination store must have disable_referential_integrity set to true. If a resource cannot be de-identified, errors will be logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

  &quot;complexDataTypeReferenceParsing&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources.

If false, uses the FHIR specification default `handling=lenient` which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header `Prefer: handling=strict` or `Prefer: handling=lenient`.
  &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist.
  &quot;disableResourceVersioning&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions.
  &quot;enableUpdateCreate&quot;: True or False, # Whether this FHIR store has the [updateCreate capability](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate). This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-existent resource return errors. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62} Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63} No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.

    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can&#x27;t be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren&#x27;t submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see [Configuring Pub/Sub notifications](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub) for specific details.
  },
  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types. For example, &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data is not streamed. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors are logged to Cloud Logging. For more information, see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

  &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store.

PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic.

  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types. For example, &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data is not streamed. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors are logged to Cloud Logging. For more information, see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  options_requestedPolicyVersion: integer, Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="import_">import_(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Imports resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases where this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to load data. Every resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID. Each resource is stored using the supplied ID regardless of the enable_update_create setting on the FHIR store. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and Cloud Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. The import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of the disable_referential_integrity setting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with arbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but if the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to be imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates referential integrity. The import process does not trigger Pub/Sub notification or BigQuery streaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store. If a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent version of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical version, regardless of the disable_resource_versioning setting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import, it&#x27;s possible that successfully imported resources will be overwritten more than once. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one resource with that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the contents it will have. The operation result counters do not count duplicate IDs as an error and count one success for each resource in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data organized in bundles produced by Patient-everything where each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner that might be referred to by many patients. If some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported resources are not rolled back. The location and format of the input data is specified by the parameters in ImportResourcesRequest. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the `BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method ignores the `Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected, and does not apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction bundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed as a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten. The bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as provided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As an example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a FHIR search or Patient-everything operation. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). Otherwise, when the operation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse is returned in the response field. The metadata field type for this operation is OperationMetadata.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the FHIR store to import FHIR resources to, in the format of `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to import resources.
  &quot;contentStructure&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The content structure in the source location. If not specified, the server treats the input source files as BUNDLE.
  &quot;gcsSource&quot;: { # Specifies the configuration for importing data from Cloud Storage. # Cloud Storage source data location and import configuration. The Healthcare Service Agent account requires the `roles/storage.objectAdmin` role on the Cloud Storage location. Each Cloud Storage object should be a text file that contains the format specified in ContentStructure.
    &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Points to a Cloud Storage URI containing file(s) to import. The URI must be in the following format: `gs://{bucket_id}/{object_id}`. The URI can include wildcards in `object_id` and thus identify multiple files. Supported wildcards: * `*` to match 0 or more non-separator characters * `**` to match 0 or more characters (including separators). Must be used at the end of a path and with no other wildcards in the path. Can also be used with a file extension (such as .ndjson), which imports all files with the extension in the specified directory and its sub-directories. For example, `gs://my-bucket/my-directory/**.ndjson` imports all files with `.ndjson` extensions in `my-directory/` and its sub-directories. * `?` to match 1 character Files matching the wildcard are expected to contain content only, no metadata.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the FHIR stores in the given dataset.

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the dataset. (required)
  filter: string, Restricts stores returned to those matching a filter. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `&quot;query text&quot;`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `&quot;Comment = great&quot;` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it&#x27;s just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Only filtering on labels is supported, for example `labels.key=value`.
  pageSize: integer, Limit on the number of FHIR stores to return in a single response. If not specified, 100 is used. May not be larger than 1000.
  pageToken: string, The next_page_token value returned from the previous List request, if any.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Lists the FHIR stores in the given dataset.
  &quot;fhirStores&quot;: [ # The returned FHIR stores. Won&#x27;t be more FHIR stores than the value of page_size in the request.
    { # Represents a FHIR store.
      &quot;complexDataTypeReferenceParsing&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources.
      &quot;defaultSearchHandlingStrict&quot;: True or False, # If true, overrides the default search behavior for this FHIR store to `handling=strict` which returns an error for unrecognized search parameters. If false, uses the FHIR specification default `handling=lenient` which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header `Prefer: handling=strict` or `Prefer: handling=lenient`.
      &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist.
      &quot;disableResourceVersioning&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions.
      &quot;enableUpdateCreate&quot;: True or False, # Whether this FHIR store has the [updateCreate capability](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate). This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-existent resource return errors. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources.
      &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62} Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63} No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.

The Pub/Sub message attributes contain a map with a string describing the action that has triggered the notification. For example, &quot;action&quot;:&quot;CreateResource&quot;.
        &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can&#x27;t be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren&#x27;t submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see [Configuring Pub/Sub notifications](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub) for specific details.
      },
      &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
        { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
          &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types. For example, &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data is not streamed. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors are logged to Cloud Logging. For more information, see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a FHIR store.
  &quot;complexDataTypeReferenceParsing&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Enable parsing of references within complex FHIR data types such as Extensions. If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed. New stores will have this value set to ENABLED after a notification period. Warning: turning on this flag causes processing existing resources to fail if they contain references to non-existent resources.
  &quot;defaultSearchHandlingStrict&quot;: True or False, # If true, overrides the default search behavior for this FHIR store to `handling=strict` which returns an error for unrecognized search parameters. If false, uses the FHIR specification default `handling=lenient` which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header `Prefer: handling=strict` or `Prefer: handling=lenient`.
  &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist.
  &quot;disableResourceVersioning&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept. The server sends errors for attempts to read the historical versions.
  &quot;enableUpdateCreate&quot;: True or False, # Whether this FHIR store has the [updateCreate capability](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.updateCreate). This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to update a non-existent resource return errors. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62} Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63} No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Resource name of the FHIR store, of the form `projects/{project_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/fhirStores/{fhir_store_id}`.
  &quot;notificationConfig&quot;: { # Specifies where to send notifications upon changes to a data store. # If non-empty, publish all resource modifications of this FHIR store to this destination. The Pub/Sub message attributes contain a map with a string describing the action that has triggered the notification. For example, &quot;action&quot;:&quot;CreateResource&quot;.
    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can&#x27;t be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren&#x27;t submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see [Configuring Pub/Sub notifications](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub) for specific details.
  },
  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types. For example, &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data is not streamed. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors are logged to Cloud Logging. For more information, see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

If this value is set to ENABLED, then features like referential integrity and Bundle reference rewriting apply to all references. If this flag has not been specified the behavior of the FHIR store will not change, references in complex data types will not be parsed.

If false, uses the FHIR specification default `handling=lenient` which ignores unrecognized search parameters. The handling can always be changed from the default on an individual API call by setting the HTTP header `Prefer: handling=strict` or `Prefer: handling=lenient`.
  &quot;disableReferentialIntegrity&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API enforces referential integrity and fails the requests that result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API skips referential integrity checks. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as GetPatientEverything, do not return all the results if broken references exist.
  &quot;disableResourceVersioning&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions are kept.

PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail.

If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren&#x27;t submitted.

  &quot;streamConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required [`bigquery.dataEditor`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) role to your project&#x27;s **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent** [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.
    { # Contains configuration for streaming FHIR export.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # The configuration for exporting to BigQuery. # The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types. For example, &quot;Patient&quot;, &quot;Observation&quot;. When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn&#x27;t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data is not streamed. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition. Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors are logged to Cloud Logging. For more information, see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.

      &quot;members&quot;: [ # Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `google.com` or `example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as `*` or `storage.*`) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
