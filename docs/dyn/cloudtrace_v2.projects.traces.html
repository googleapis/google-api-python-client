Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the project where the spans belong. The format is
`projects/[PROJECT_ID]`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

        # spans, or the results are undefined.
      { # A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be
          # nested to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span

          # its sub-operations. A trace can also contain multiple root spans,

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:

      #     service Foo {

      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
