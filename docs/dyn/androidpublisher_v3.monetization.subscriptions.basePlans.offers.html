  productId: string, Required. The product ID of the parent subscription, if all updated offers belong to the same subscription. If this request spans multiple subscriptions, set this field to &quot;-&quot;. Must be set. (required)
  basePlanId: string, Required. The parent base plan (ID) for which the offers should be updated. May be specified as &#x27;-&#x27; to update offers from multiple base plans. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
