  <pre>Creates a composite index. This returns a google.longrunning.Operation which may be used to track the status of the creation. The metadata for the operation will be the type IndexOperationMetadata.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. A parent name of the form `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/{collection_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Cloud Firestore indexes enable simple and complex queries against documents in a database.
  &quot;fields&quot;: [ # The fields supported by this index. For composite indexes, this is always 2 or more fields. The last field entry is always for the field path `__name__`. If, on creation, `__name__` was not specified as the last field, it will be added automatically with the same direction as that of the last field defined. If the final field in a composite index is not directional, the `__name__` will be ordered ASCENDING (unless explicitly specified). For single field indexes, this will always be exactly one entry with a field path equal to the field path of the associated field.
    { # A field in an index. The field_path describes which field is indexed, the value_mode describes how the field value is indexed.
      &quot;arrayConfig&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Indicates that this field supports operations on `array_value`s.
      &quot;fieldPath&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Can be __name__. For single field indexes, this must match the name of the field or may be omitted.
      &quot;order&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Indicates that this field supports ordering by the specified order or comparing using =, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=.
    },
  ],
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A server defined name for this index. The form of this name for composite indexes will be: `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/{collection_id}/indexes/{composite_index_id}` For single field indexes, this field will be empty.
  &quot;queryScope&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Indexes with a collection query scope specified allow queries against a collection that is the child of a specific document, specified at query time, and that has the same collection id. Indexes with a collection group query scope specified allow queries against all collections descended from a specific document, specified at query time, and that have the same collection id as this index.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The serving state of the index.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
