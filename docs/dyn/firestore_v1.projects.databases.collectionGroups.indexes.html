  <pre>Creates a composite index. This returns a google.longrunning.Operation
which may be used to track the status of the creation. The metadata for
the operation will be the type IndexOperationMetadata.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. A parent name of the form
`projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/{collection_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Cloud Firestore indexes enable simple and complex queries against
    # documents in a database.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A server defined name for this index.
      # The form of this name for composite indexes will be:
      # `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/{collection_id}/indexes/{composite_index_id}`
      # For single field indexes, this field will be empty.
  &quot;queryScope&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Indexes with a collection query scope specified allow queries
      # against a collection that is the child of a specific document, specified at
      # query time, and that has the same collection id.
      # 
      # Indexes with a collection group query scope specified allow queries against
      # all collections descended from a specific document, specified at query
      # time, and that have the same collection id as this index.
  &quot;fields&quot;: [ # The fields supported by this index.
      # 
      # For composite indexes, this is always 2 or more fields.
      # The last field entry is always for the field path `__name__`. If, on
      # creation, `__name__` was not specified as the last field, it will be added
      # automatically with the same direction as that of the last field defined. If
      # the final field in a composite index is not directional, the `__name__`
      # will be ordered ASCENDING (unless explicitly specified).
      # 
      # For single field indexes, this will always be exactly one entry with a
      # field path equal to the field path of the associated field.
    { # A field in an index.

      &quot;fieldPath&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Can be __name__.
          # For single field indexes, this must match the name of the field or may
          # be omitted.
      &quot;order&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Indicates that this field supports ordering by the specified order or
          # comparing using =, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=.

        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`

        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.

    &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
