  <pre>Check a particular requirement.

Args:
  location: string, Required. Full resource name of the location. Format `projects/{project_number_or_id}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for CheckRequirement method.
  &quot;requirementType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type specifying the requirement to check. The supported types are: * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/media_recs/general/all/warning` * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/media_recs/oyml/cvr/warning` * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/media_recs/rfy/cvr/warning` * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/media_recs/mlt/cvr/warning` * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/media_recs/mp/cvr/warning` * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/media_recs/oyml/wdps/warning` * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/media_recs/rfy/wdps/warning` * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/media_recs/mlt/wdps/warning`
  &quot;resources&quot;: [ # The type needed for the monitored resources: * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/Branch`. * The labels needed for this resource: * `project`_`number` * `location`_`id` * `collection`_`id` * `datastore`_`id` * `branch`_`id` * `discoveryengine.googleapis.com/DataStore` * The labels needed for this resource: * `project`_`number` * `location`_`id` * `collection`_`id` * `datastore`_`id`
    { # An object representing a resource that can be used for monitoring, logging, billing, or other purposes. Examples include virtual machine instances, databases, and storage devices such as disks. The `type` field identifies a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object that describes the resource&#x27;s schema. Information in the `labels` field identifies the actual resource and its attributes according to the schema. For example, a particular Compute Engine VM instance could be represented by the following object, because the MonitoredResourceDescriptor for `&quot;gce_instance&quot;` has labels `&quot;project_id&quot;`, `&quot;instance_id&quot;` and `&quot;zone&quot;`: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;gce_instance&quot;, &quot;labels&quot;: { &quot;project_id&quot;: &quot;my-project&quot;, &quot;instance_id&quot;: &quot;12345678901234&quot;, &quot;zone&quot;: &quot;us-central1-a&quot; }}
      &quot;labels&quot;: { # Required. Values for all of the labels listed in the associated monitored resource descriptor. For example, Compute Engine VM instances use the labels `&quot;project_id&quot;`, `&quot;instance_id&quot;`, and `&quot;zone&quot;`.
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
      },
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The monitored resource type. This field must match the `type` field of a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object. For example, the type of a Compute Engine VM instance is `gce_instance`. Some descriptors include the service name in the type; for example, the type of a Datastream stream is `datastream.googleapis.com/Stream`.
    },

}

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

Returns:

      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time corresponding to when this metric value was calculated.
      &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unit in which this metric is reported. Follows [The Unified Code for Units of Measure](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard.

        &quot;boolValue&quot;: True or False, # A Boolean value: `true` or `false`.
        &quot;distributionValue&quot;: { # `Distribution` contains summary statistics for a population of values. It optionally contains a histogram representing the distribution of those values across a set of buckets. The summary statistics are the count, mean, sum of the squared deviation from the mean, the minimum, and the maximum of the set of population of values. The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing widths. Although it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include non-finite values (infinities or NaNs) in the population of values, as this will render the `mean` and `sum_of_squared_deviation` fields meaningless. # A distribution value.
          &quot;bucketCounts&quot;: [ # The number of values in each bucket of the histogram, as described in `bucket_options`. If the distribution does not have a histogram, then omit this field. If there is a histogram, then the sum of the values in `bucket_counts` must equal the value in the `count` field of the distribution. If present, `bucket_counts` should contain N values, where N is the number of buckets specified in `bucket_options`. If you supply fewer than N values, the remaining values are assumed to be 0. The order of the values in `bucket_counts` follows the bucket numbering schemes described for the three bucket types. The first value must be the count for the underflow bucket (number 0). The next N-2 values are the counts for the finite buckets (number 1 through N-2). The N&#x27;th value in `bucket_counts` is the count for the overflow bucket (number N-1).

A bucket has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the values that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket must be strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets for a distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N - 1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i &gt; 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span the whole range of finite values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is -infinity and the upper bound of the overflow bucket is +infinity. The finite buckets are so-called because both bounds are finite. # Defines the histogram bucket boundaries. If the distribution does not contain a histogram, then omit this field.
