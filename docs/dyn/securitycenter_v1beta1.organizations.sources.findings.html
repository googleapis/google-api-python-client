  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are not supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: * name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.
  &quot;groupBy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Expression that defines what assets fields to use for grouping (including `state`). The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: &quot;parent,resource_name&quot;.

  orderBy: string, Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: &quot;name,resource_properties.a_property&quot;. The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix &quot; desc&quot; should be appended to the field name. For example: &quot;name desc,source_properties.a_property&quot;. Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant. &quot;name desc,source_properties.a_property&quot; and &quot; name desc , source_properties.a_property &quot; are equivalent.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
  pageToken: string, The value returned by the last `ListFindingsResponse`; indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListFindings` call, and that the system should return the next page of data.
