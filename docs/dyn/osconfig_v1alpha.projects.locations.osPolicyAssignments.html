The `ExecResource` has 2 stages: `validate` and `enforce` and both stages accept a script as an argument to execute.

The `validate` stage can signal that the `ExecResource` is already in the desired state by returning an exit code of `100`. If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state, it should return an exit code of `101`. Any other exit code returned by this stage is considered an error. If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state based on the exit code from the `validate` stage, the agent proceeds to execute the script from the `enforce` stage. If the `ExecResource` is already in the desired state, the `enforce` stage will not be run. Similar to `validate` stage, the `enforce` stage should return an exit code of `100` to indicate that the resource in now in its desired state. Any other exit code is considered an error. NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen over `0` (and `101` vs `1`) to have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in desired state` and errors. Because, for example, Powershell will always return an exit code of `0` unless an `exit` statement is provided in the script.

The `ExecResource` has 2 stages: `validate` and `enforce` and both stages accept a script as an argument to execute. When the `ExecResource` is applied by the agent, it first executes the script in the `validate` stage. The `validate` stage can signal that the `ExecResource` is already in the desired state by returning an exit code of `100`. If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state, it should return an exit code of `101`. Any other exit code returned by this stage is considered an error. If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state based on the exit code from the `validate` stage, the agent proceeds to execute the script from the `enforce` stage. If the `ExecResource` is already in the desired state, the `enforce` stage will not be run. Similar to `validate` stage, the `enforce` stage should return an exit code of `100` to indicate that the resource in now in its desired state. Any other exit code is considered an error. NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen over `0` (and `101` vs `1`) to have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in desired state` and errors. Because, for example, Powershell will always return an exit code of `0` unless an `exit` statement is provided in the script.

If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state, it should return an exit code of `101`. Any other exit code returned by this stage is considered an error.

    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
