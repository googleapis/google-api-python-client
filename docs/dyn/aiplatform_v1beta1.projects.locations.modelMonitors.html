Note: Nested features are not supported, so please ensure your features are flattened. Ensure the feature values are scalar or an array of scalars. * For &#x27;bigquery&#x27; dataset, we will extract the corresponding feature values if the column names match the feature names. Note: The column type can be a scalar or an array of scalars. STRUCT or JSON types are not supported. You may use SQL queries to select or aggregate the relevant features from your original table. However, ensure that the &#x27;schema&#x27; of the query results meets our requirements. * For the Vertex AI Endpoint Request Response Logging table or Vertex AI Batch Prediction Job results. If the instance_type is an array, ensure that the sequence in feature_fields matches the order of features in the prediction instance. We will match the feature with the array in the order specified in [feature_fields].
