Make sure that the schema aligns with your dataset, if it does not, we will be unable to extract data from the dataset. It is required for most models, but optional for Vertex AI AutoML Tables unless the schem information is not available.

Vertex AI will try to match the features from your dataset as follows: * For &#x27;csv&#x27; files, the header names are required, and we will extract the corresponding feature values when the header names align with the feature names. * For &#x27;jsonl&#x27; files, we will extract the corresponding feature values if the key names match the feature names. Note: Nested features are not supported, so please ensure your features are flattened. Ensure the feature values are scalar or an array of scalars. * For &#x27;bigquery&#x27; dataset, we will extract the corresponding feature values if the column names match the feature names. Note: The column type can be a scalar or an array of scalars. STRUCT or JSON types are not supported. You may use SQL queries to select or aggregate the relevant features from your original table. However, ensure that the &#x27;schema&#x27; of the query results meets our requirements. * For the Vertex AI Endpoint Request Response Logging table or Vertex AI Batch Prediction Job results. If the instance_type is an array, ensure that the sequence in feature_fields matches the order of features in the prediction instance. We will match the feature with the array in the order specified in [feature_fields].
