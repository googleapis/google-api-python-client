<field> is the path for a field or map key in the Pool proto message.
e.g. "configuration.disk_size_gb" or "configuration.labels.key".
<operator> can be one of "<", "<=", ">=", ">", "=", "!=", ":".
":" is a HAS operation for strings and repeated primitive fields.
<value> is the value to test, case-insensitive for strings. "*" stands for
any value and can be used to test for key presence.
Parenthesis determine AND/OR precedence. In space separated restrictions,
AND is implicit, e.g. "a = b x = y" is equivalent to "a = b AND x = y".

Example filter:
configuration.labels.key1 = * AND (state = RUNNING OR state = UPDATING)

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
        # three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
        #
        # You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
        # [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
          # message types for APIs to use.
        {
          "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
