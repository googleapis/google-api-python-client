<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a slot pool. Attempting to delete slot pool before its
commitment_end_time will fail with the error code
`google.rpc.Code.FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

Args:
  name: string, Resource name of the slot pool to delete. E.g.,
   projects/myproject/locations/us-central1/reservations/my_reservation/slotPools/123 (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
