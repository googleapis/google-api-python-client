    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, backendAuthenticationConfigId=None, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new BackendAuthenticationConfig in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the BackendAuthenticationConfig. Must be in the format `projects/*/locations/{location}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # BackendAuthenticationConfig message groups the TrustConfig together with other settings that control how the load balancer authenticates, and expresses its identity to, the backend: * `trustConfig` is the attached TrustConfig. * `wellKnownRoots` indicates whether the load balance should trust backend server certificates that are issued by public certificate authorities, in addition to certificates trusted by the TrustConfig. * `clientCertificate` is a client certificate that the load balancer uses to express its identity to the backend, if the connection to the backend uses mTLS. You can attach the BackendAuthenticationConfig to the load balancer&#x27;s BackendService directly determining how that BackendService negotiates TLS.
  &quot;clientCertificate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A reference to a certificatemanager.googleapis.com.Certificate resource. This is a relative resource path following the form &quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/certificates/{certificate}&quot;. Used by a BackendService to negotiate mTLS when the backend connection uses TLS and the backend requests a client certificate. Must have a CLIENT_AUTH scope.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Free-text description of the resource.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Etag of the resource.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Set of label tags associated with the resource.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Name of the BackendAuthenticationConfig resource. It matches the pattern `projects/*/locations/{location}/backendAuthenticationConfigs/{backend_authentication_config}`
  &quot;trustConfig&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A reference to a TrustConfig resource from the certificatemanager.googleapis.com namespace. This is a relative resource path following the form &quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/trustConfigs/{trust_config}&quot;. A BackendService uses the chain of trust represented by this TrustConfig, if specified, to validate the server certificates presented by the backend. Required unless wellKnownRoots is set to PUBLIC_ROOTS.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was updated.
  &quot;wellKnownRoots&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Well known roots to use for server certificate validation.
}

  backendAuthenticationConfigId: string, Required. Short name of the BackendAuthenticationConfig resource to be created. This value should be 1-63 characters long, containing only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, and should not start with a number. E.g. &quot;backend-auth-config&quot;.
