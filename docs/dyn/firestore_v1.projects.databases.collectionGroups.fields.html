Args:

  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates a field configuration. Currently, field updates apply only to
single field index configuration. However, calls to
FirestoreAdmin.UpdateField should provide a field mask to avoid
changing any configuration that the caller isn&#x27;t aware of. The field mask
should be specified as: `{ paths: &quot;index_config&quot; }`.

This call returns a google.longrunning.Operation which may be used to
track the status of the field update. The metadata for
the operation will be the type FieldOperationMetadata.

To configure the default field settings for the database, use
the special `Field` with resource name:
`projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/*`.

Args:
  name: string, A field name of the form
`projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/{collection_id}/fields/{field_path}`

A field path may be a simple field name, e.g. `address` or a path to fields
within map_value , e.g. `address.city`,
or a special field path. The only valid special field is `*`, which
represents any field.

Field paths may be quoted using ` (backtick). The only character that needs
to be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself,
escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that
must be quoted include: `*`, `.`,
``` (backtick), `[`, `]`, as well as any ascii symbolic characters.

Examples:
(Note: Comments here are written in markdown syntax, so there is an
 additional layer of backticks to represent a code block)
`\`address.city\`` represents a field named `address.city`, not the map key
`city` in the field `address`.
`\`*\`` represents a field named `*`, not any field.

A special `Field` contains the default indexing settings for all fields.
This field&#x27;s resource name is:
`projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/*`
Indexes defined on this `Field` will be applied to all fields which do not
have their own `Field` index configuration. (required)

    &quot;usesAncestorConfig&quot;: True or False, # Output only. When true, the `Field`&#x27;s index configuration is set from the

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A field name of the form
      # `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/{collection_id}/fields/{field_path}`
      # 
      # A field path may be a simple field name, e.g. `address` or a path to fields
      # within map_value , e.g. `address.city`,
      # or a special field path. The only valid special field is `*`, which
      # represents any field.
      # 
      # Field paths may be quoted using ` (backtick). The only character that needs
      # to be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself,
      # escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that
      # must be quoted include: `*`, `.`,
      # ``` (backtick), `[`, `]`, as well as any ascii symbolic characters.
      # 
      # Examples:
      # (Note: Comments here are written in markdown syntax, so there is an
      #  additional layer of backticks to represent a code block)
      # `\`address.city\`` represents a field named `address.city`, not the map key
      # `city` in the field `address`.
      # `\`*\`` represents a field named `*`, not any field.
      # 
      # A special `Field` contains the default indexing settings for all fields.
      # This field&#x27;s resource name is:
      # `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/*`
      # Indexes defined on this `Field` will be applied to all fields which do not
      # have their own `Field` index configuration.
}

  updateMask: string, A mask, relative to the field. If specified, only configuration specified
by this field_mask will be updated in the field.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
    &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
        # three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
        #
        # You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
        # [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of

      &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    },
    &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
