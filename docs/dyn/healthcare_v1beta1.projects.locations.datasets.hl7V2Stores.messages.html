<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a message and sends a notification to the Cloud Pub/Sub topic. If
configured, the MLLP adapter listens to messages created by this method and
sends those back to the hospital. A successful response indicates the
message has been persisted to storage and a Cloud Pub/Sub notification has
been sent. Sending to the hospital by the MLLP adapter happens
asynchronously.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all the messages in the given HL7v2 store with support for filtering.

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the HL7v2 store to retrieve messages from. (required)
  orderBy: string, Orders messages returned by the specified order_by clause.
Syntax: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/design_patterns#sorting_order

Fields available for ordering are:

*  `send_time`
  pageSize: integer, Limit on the number of messages to return in a single response.
If zero the default page size of 100 is used.
  pageToken: string, The next_page_token value returned from the previous List request, if any.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, Restricts messages returned to those matching a filter. Syntax:
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/search/query_strings

Fields/functions available for filtering are:

*  `message_type`, from the MSH-9 segment; for example
`NOT message_type = "ADT"`
*  `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in
the dataset's time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment; for example
`send_date < "2017-01-02"`
*  `send_time`, the timestamp of when the message was sent, using the
RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment; for example
`send_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`
*  `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the
MSH-4 segment; for example `send_facility = "ABC"`
*  `HL7RegExp(expr)`, which does regular expression matching of `expr`
against the message payload using re2 (http://code.google.com/p/re2/)
syntax; for example `HL7RegExp("^.*\|.*\|EMERG")`
*  `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient
having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4
segments; for example `PatientId("123456", "MRN")`
*  `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the
Message.labels
map, for example `labels."priority"="high"`. The operator `:*` can be used
to assert the existence of a label, for example `labels."priority":*`.

Limitations on conjunctions:

*  Negation on the patient ID function or the labels field is not
supported, for example these queries are invalid:
`NOT PatientId("123456", "MRN")`, `NOT labels."tag1":*`,
`NOT labels."tag2"="val2"`.
*  Conjunction of multiple patient ID functions is not supported, for
example this query is invalid:
`PatientId("123456", "MRN") AND PatientId("456789", "MRN")`.
*  Conjunction of multiple labels fields is also not supported, for
example this query is invalid: `labels."tag1":* AND labels."tag2"="val2"`.
*  Conjunction of one patient ID function, one labels field and conditions
on other fields is supported, for example this query is valid:
`PatientId("123456", "MRN") AND labels."tag1":* AND message_type = "ADT"`.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Lists the messages in the specified HL7v2 store.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # Token to retrieve the next page of results or empty if there are no more
        # results in the list.

  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
