Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.

        # `GetIamPolicy`. This field is only used by Cloud IAM.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
      # request, the resource, or both.
