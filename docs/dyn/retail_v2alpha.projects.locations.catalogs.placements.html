  <pre>Makes a recommendation prediction.

Args:
  placement: string, Required. Full resource name of the format: {name=projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/placements/*} The id of the recommendation engine placement. This id is used to identify the set of models that will be used to make the prediction. We currently support three placements with the following IDs by default: * `shopping_cart`: Predicts products frequently bought together with one or more products in the same shopping session. Commonly displayed after `add-to-cart` events, on product detail pages, or on the shopping cart page. * `home_page`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely engage with or purchase based on the shopping or viewing history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId`. For example - Recommendations for you. * `product_detail`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely engage with or purchase. The prediction is based on the shopping or viewing history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId` and its relevance to a specified `CatalogItem`. Typically used on product detail pages. For example - More products like this. * `recently_viewed_default`: Returns up to 75 products recently viewed by the specified `userId` or `visitorId`, most recent ones first. Returns nothing if neither of them has viewed any products yet. For example - Recently viewed. The full list of available placements can be seen at https://console.cloud.google.com/recommendation/catalogs/default_catalog/placements (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for Predict method.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Filter for restricting prediction results with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Accepts values for tags and the `filterOutOfStockItems` flag. * Tag expressions. Restricts predictions to products that match all of the specified tags. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the expression is enclosed in parentheses, and must be separated from the tag values by a space. `-&quot;tagA&quot;` is also supported and is equivalent to `NOT &quot;tagA&quot;`. Tag values must be double quoted UTF-8 encoded strings with a size limit of 1,000 characters. * filterOutOfStockItems. Restricts predictions to products that do not have a stockState value of OUT_OF_STOCK. Examples: * tag=(&quot;Red&quot; OR &quot;Blue&quot;) tag=&quot;New-Arrival&quot; tag=(NOT &quot;promotional&quot;) * filterOutOfStockItems tag=(-&quot;promotional&quot;) * filterOutOfStockItems If your filter blocks all prediction results, nothing will be returned. If you want generic (unfiltered) popular products to be returned instead, set `strictFiltering` to false in `PredictRequest.params`.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # The labels for the predict request. * Label keys can contain lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, must start with a letter, and must end with a letter or digit. * Non-zero label values can contain lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, must start with a letter, and must end with a letter or digit. * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given request. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # Maximum number of results to return per page. Set this property to the number of prediction results needed. If zero, the service will choose a reasonable default. The maximum allowed value is 100. Values above 100 will be coerced to 100.
  &quot;pageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The previous PredictResponse.next_page_token.
  &quot;params&quot;: { # Additional domain specific parameters for the predictions. Allowed values: * `returnProduct`: Boolean. If set to true, the associated product object will be returned in the `results.metadata` field in the prediction response. * `returnScore`: Boolean. If set to true, the prediction &#x27;score&#x27; corresponding to each returned product will be set in the `results.metadata` field in the prediction response. The given &#x27;score&#x27; indicates the probability of an product being clicked/purchased given the user&#x27;s context and history. * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to false, the service will return generic (unfiltered) popular products instead of empty if your filter blocks all prediction results.

The value must be a valid PredictResponse.attribution_token for user events that are the result of PredictionService.Predict. This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or purchase back to the event and the particular predict response containing this clicked/purchased product. If user clicks on product K in the recommendation results, pass PredictResponse.attribution_token as a URL parameter to product K&#x27;s page. When recording events on product K&#x27;s page, log the PredictResponse.attribution_token to this field.
    &quot;cartId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The id or name of the associated shopping cart. This id is used to associate multiple items added or present in the cart before purchase. This can only be set for `add-to-cart`, `purchase-complete`, or `shopping-cart-page-view` events.
