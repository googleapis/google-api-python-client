<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(parent, name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Inserts or updates the attributes of the product in a Manufacturer Center
account.

Creates a product with the provided attributes. If the product already
exists, then all attributes are replaced with the new ones. The checks at
upload time are minimal. All required attributes need to be present for a
product to be valid. Issues may show up later after the API has accepted a
new upload for a product and it is possible to overwrite an existing valid
product with an invalid product. To detect this, you should retrieve the
product and check it for issues once the new version is available.

Uploaded attributes first need to be processed before they can be
retrieved. Until then, new products will be unavailable, and retrieval
of previously uploaded products will return the original state of the
product.

Args:
  parent: string, Parent ID in the format `accounts/{account_id}`.

`account_id` - The ID of the Manufacturer Center account. (required)
  name: string, Name in the format `{target_country}:{content_language}:{product_id}`.

`target_country`   - The target country of the product as a CLDR territory
                     code (for example, US).

`content_language` - The content language of the product as a two-letter
                     ISO 639-1 language code (for example, en).

`product_id`     -   The ID of the product. For more information, see
                     https://support.google.com/manufacturers/answer/6124116#id. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
