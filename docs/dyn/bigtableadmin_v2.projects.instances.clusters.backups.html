  <pre>Copy a Cloud Bigtable backup to a new backup in the destination cluster located in the destination instance and project.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the destination cluster that will contain the backup copy. The cluster must already exists. Values are of the form: `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/{cluster}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for CopyBackup.
  &quot;backupId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The id of the new backup. The `backup_id` along with `parent` are combined as {parent}/backups/{backup_id} to create the full backup name, of the form: `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/{cluster}/backups/{backup_id}`. This string must be between 1 and 50 characters in length and match the regex _a-zA-Z0-9*.
  &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Required. The expiration time of the copied backup with microsecond granularity that must be at least 6 hours and at most 30 days from the time the request is received. Once the `expire_time` has passed, Cloud Bigtable will delete the backup and free the resources used by the backup.
  &quot;sourceBackup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The source backup to be copied from. The source backup needs to be in READY state for it to be copied. Copying a copied backup is not allowed. Once CopyBackup is in progress, the source backup cannot be deleted or cleaned up on expiration until CopyBackup is finished. Values are of the form: `projects//instances//clusters//backups/`.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts).

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Cloud Bigtable backups. Returns both completed and pending backups.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The cluster to list backups from. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/{cluster}`. Use `{cluster} = &#x27;-&#x27;` to list backups for all clusters in an instance, e.g., `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/-`. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters backups listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, !=, =, or :. Colon &#x27;:&#x27; represents a HAS operator which is roughly synonymous with equality. Filter rules are case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are: * `name` * `source_table` * `state` * `start_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `end_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `expire_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `size_bytes` To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND, OR, and NOT expressions explicitly. Some examples of using filters are: * `name:&quot;exact&quot;` --&gt; The backup&#x27;s name is the string &quot;exact&quot;. * `name:howl` --&gt; The backup&#x27;s name contains the string &quot;howl&quot;. * `source_table:prod` --&gt; The source_table&#x27;s name contains the string &quot;prod&quot;. * `state:CREATING` --&gt; The backup is pending creation. * `state:READY` --&gt; The backup is fully created and ready for use. * `(name:howl) AND (start_time &lt; \&quot;2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\&quot;)` --&gt; The backup name contains the string &quot;howl&quot; and start_time of the backup is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z. * `size_bytes &gt; 10000000000` --&gt; The backup&#x27;s size is greater than 10GB
  orderBy: string, An expression for specifying the sort order of the results of the request. The string value should specify one or more fields in Backup. The full syntax is described at https://aip.dev/132#ordering. Fields supported are: * name * source_table * expire_time * start_time * end_time * size_bytes * state For example, &quot;start_time&quot;. The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for the field, a suffix &quot; desc&quot; should be appended to the field name. For example, &quot;start_time desc&quot;. Redundant space characters in the syntax are insigificant. If order_by is empty, results will be sorted by `start_time` in descending order starting from the most recently created backup.
  pageSize: integer, Number of backups to be returned in the response. If 0 or less, defaults to the server&#x27;s maximum allowed page size.
  pageToken: string, If non-empty, `page_token` should contain a next_page_token from a previous ListBackupsResponse to the same `parent` and with the same `filter`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.
