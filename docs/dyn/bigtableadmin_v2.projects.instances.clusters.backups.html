    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Cloud Bigtable backups. Returns both completed and pending backups.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The cluster to list backups from. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/{cluster}`. Use `{cluster} = &#x27;-&#x27;` to list backups for all clusters in an instance, e.g., `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/-`. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters backups listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, !=, =, or :. Colon &#x27;:&#x27; represents a HAS operator which is roughly synonymous with equality. Filter rules are case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are: * `name` * `source_table` * `state` * `start_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `end_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `expire_time` (and values are of the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) * `size_bytes` To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND, OR, and NOT expressions explicitly. Some examples of using filters are: * `name:&quot;exact&quot;` --&gt; The backup&#x27;s name is the string &quot;exact&quot;. * `name:howl` --&gt; The backup&#x27;s name contains the string &quot;howl&quot;. * `source_table:prod` --&gt; The source_table&#x27;s name contains the string &quot;prod&quot;. * `state:CREATING` --&gt; The backup is pending creation. * `state:READY` --&gt; The backup is fully created and ready for use. * `(name:howl) AND (start_time &lt; \&quot;2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\&quot;)` --&gt; The backup name contains the string &quot;howl&quot; and start_time of the backup is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z. * `size_bytes &gt; 10000000000` --&gt; The backup&#x27;s size is greater than 10GB
  orderBy: string, An expression for specifying the sort order of the results of the request. The string value should specify one or more fields in Backup. The full syntax is described at https://aip.dev/132#ordering. Fields supported are: * name * source_table * expire_time * start_time * end_time * size_bytes * state For example, &quot;start_time&quot;. The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for the field, a suffix &quot; desc&quot; should be appended to the field name. For example, &quot;start_time desc&quot;. Redundant space characters in the syntax are insigificant. If order_by is empty, results will be sorted by `start_time` in descending order starting from the most recently created backup.
  pageSize: integer, Number of backups to be returned in the response. If 0 or less, defaults to the server&#x27;s maximum allowed page size.
  pageToken: string, If non-empty, `page_token` should contain a next_page_token from a previous ListBackupsResponse to the same `parent` and with the same `filter`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
