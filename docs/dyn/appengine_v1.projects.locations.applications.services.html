<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(projectsId, locationsId, applicationsId, servicesId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the current configuration of the specified service.

Args:
  projectsId: string, Part of `name`. Name of the resource requested. Example: apps/myapp/services/default. (required)
  locationsId: string, Part of `name`. See documentation of `projectsId`. (required)
  applicationsId: string, Part of `name`. See documentation of `projectsId`. (required)
  servicesId: string, Part of `name`. See documentation of `projectsId`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A Service resource is a logical component of an application that can share state and communicate in a secure fashion with other services. For example, an application that handles customer requests might include separate services to handle tasks such as backend data analysis or API requests from mobile devices.

  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Relative name of the service within the application. Example: default.@OutputOnly
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # A set of labels to apply to this service. Labels are key/value pairs that describe the service and all resources that belong to it (e.g., versions). The labels can be used to search and group resources, and are propagated to the usage and billing reports, enabling fine-grain analysis of costs. An example of using labels is to tag resources belonging to different environments (e.g., &quot;env=prod&quot;, &quot;env=qa&quot;). Label keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters and can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, dashes, and international characters. Label keys must start with a lowercase letter or an international character. Each service can have at most 32 labels.
