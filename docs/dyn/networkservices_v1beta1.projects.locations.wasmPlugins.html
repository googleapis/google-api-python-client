  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A human-readable description of the resource.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Set of labels associated with the `WasmPlugin` resource. The format must comply with [the following requirements](/compute/docs/labeling-resources#requirements).
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;logConfig&quot;: { # Specifies the logging options for the activity performed by this plugin. If logging is enabled, plugin logs are exported to Cloud Logging. # Optional. Specifies the logging options for the activity performed by this plugin. If logging is enabled, plugin logs are exported to Cloud Logging. Note that the settings relate to the logs generated by using logging statements in your Wasm code.
    &quot;enable&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Specifies whether to enable logging for activity by this plugin. Defaults to `false`.
    &quot;minLogLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Non-empty default. Specificies the lowest level of the plugin logs that are exported to Cloud Logging. This setting relates to the logs generated by using logging statements in your Wasm code. This field is can be set only if logging is enabled for the plugin. If the field is not provided when logging is enabled, it is set to `INFO` by default.
    &quot;sampleRate&quot;: 3.14, # Non-empty default. Configures the sampling rate of activity logs, where `1.0` means all logged activity is reported and `0.0` means no activity is reported. A floating point value between `0.0` and `1.0` indicates that a percentage of log messages is stored. The default value when logging is enabled is `1.0`. The value of the field must be between `0` and `1` (inclusive). This field can be specified only if logging is enabled for this plugin.
  },
  &quot;mainVersionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The ID of the `WasmPluginVersion` resource that is the currently serving one. The version referred to must be a child of this `WasmPlugin` resource.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. Name of the `WasmPlugin` resource in the following format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/wasmPlugins/{wasm_plugin}`.

Lets you create or update a `WasmPlugin` resource and its versions in a single request. When the `main_version_id` field is not empty, it must point to one of the `VersionDetails` objects in the map. If provided in a `PATCH` request, the new versions replace the previous set. Any version omitted from the `versions` field is removed. Because the `WasmPluginVersion` resource is immutable, if a `WasmPluginVersion` resource with the same name already exists and differs, the request fails. Note: In a `GET` request, this field is populated only if the field `GetWasmPluginRequest.view` is set to `WASM_PLUGIN_VIEW_FULL`.

Because the `WasmPluginVersion` resource is immutable, if a `WasmPluginVersion` resource with the same name already exists and differs, the request fails. Note: In a `GET` request, this field is populated only if the field `GetWasmPluginRequest.view` is set to `WASM_PLUGIN_VIEW_FULL`.

          &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A human-readable description of the resource.
          &quot;imageDigest&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resolved digest for the image specified in `image`. The digest is resolved during the creation of a `WasmPluginVersion` resource. This field holds the digest value regardless of whether a tag or digest was originally specified in the `image` field.
          &quot;imageUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. URI of the container image containing the Wasm module, stored in the Artifact Registry. The container image must contain only a single file with the name `plugin.wasm`. When a new `WasmPluginVersion` resource is created, the URI gets resolved to an image digest and saved in the `image_digest` field.
          &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Set of labels associated with the `WasmPluginVersion` resource.
            &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,

          &quot;pluginConfigDigest&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. This field holds the digest (usually checksum) value for the plugin configuration. The value is calculated based on the contents of the `plugin_config_data` field or the container image defined by the `plugin_config_uri` field.
          &quot;pluginConfigUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # URI of the plugin configuration stored in the Artifact Registry. The configuration is provided to the plugin at runtime through the `ON_CONFIGURE` callback. The container image must contain only a single file with the name `plugin.config`.

Lets you create or update a `WasmPlugin` resource and its versions in a single request. When the `main_version_id` field is not empty, it must point to one of the `VersionDetails` objects in the map. If provided in a `PATCH` request, the new versions replace the previous set. Any version omitted from the `versions` field is removed.

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
