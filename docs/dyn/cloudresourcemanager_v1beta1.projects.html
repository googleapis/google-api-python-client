<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body, useLegacyStack=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a Project resource.

Initially, the Project resource is owned by its creator exclusively.
The creator can later grant permission to others to read or update the
Project.

Several APIs are activated automatically for the Project, including
Google Cloud Storage.

    # container for ACLs, APIs, App Engine Apps, VMs, and other
    # Google Cloud Platform resources.
  "name": "A String", # The user-assigned display name of the Project.
      # It must be 4 to 30 characters.
      # Allowed characters are: lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers,
      # hyphen, single-quote, double-quote, space, and exclamation point.
      #

  "parent": { # A container to reference an id for any resource type. A `resource` in Google # An optional reference to a parent Resource.

      # `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission on the parent.
      # 
      # Read-write.
      # Cloud Platform is a generic term for something you (a developer) may want to

      # 
      # No more than 256 labels can be associated with a given resource.
      # 
      # Clients should store labels in a representation such as JSON that does not
      # depend on specific characters being disallowed.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(projectId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Marks the Project identified by the specified
`project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`) for deletion.
This method will only affect the Project if the following criteria are met:

+ The Project does not have a billing account associated with it.
+ The Project has a lifecycle state of
ACTIVE.

This method changes the Project's lifecycle state from
ACTIVE
to DELETE_REQUESTED.
The deletion starts at an unspecified time, at which point the project is
no longer accessible.

Until the deletion completes, you can check the lifecycle state
checked by retrieving the Project with GetProject,
and the Project remains visible to ListProjects.
However, you cannot update the project.

After the deletion completes, the Project is not retrievable by
the  GetProject and
ListProjects methods.

The caller must have modify permissions for this Project.

Args:
  projectId: string, The Project ID (for example, `foo-bar-123`).

Required. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:

      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }

specified filter. This method returns Projects in an unspecified order.
New Projects do not necessarily appear at the end of the list.

Args:
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of Projects to return in the response.
The server can return fewer Projects than requested.

case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are:

+ `name`
+ `id`
+ <code>labels.<em>key</em></code> where *key* is the name of a label

Some examples of using labels as filters:

|Filter|Description|
|------|-----------|
|name:how*|The project's name starts with "how".|
|name:Howl|The project's name is `Howl` or `howl`.|
|name:HOWL|Equivalent to above.|

    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified Project. Replaces
any existing policy.

The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`:

+ Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as
`members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`.

+ The owner role can be granted only to `user` and `serviceAccount`.

+ Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly
without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be
invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.

+ A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user
must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must
explicitly accept the invitation.

+ Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using
`setIamPolicy()`; they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console.

+ Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have
accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.

+ There must be at least one owner who has accepted the Terms of
Service (ToS) agreement in the policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to
remove the last ToS-accepted owner from the policy will fail. This
restriction also applies to legacy projects that no longer have owners
who have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM policies will be rejected until
the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is rectified.

+ Calling this method requires enabling the App Engine Admin API.

Note: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles
can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand
how the service account is being used before removing or updating its
roles.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.

  body: object, The request body. (required)
