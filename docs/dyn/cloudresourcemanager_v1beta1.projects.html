<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body=None, useLegacyStack=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a Project resource.

Initially, the Project resource is owned by its creator exclusively.
The creator can later grant permission to others to read or update the
Project.

Several APIs are activated automatically for the Project, including
Google Cloud Storage. The parent is identified by a specified
ResourceId, which must include both an ID and a type, such as
project, folder, or organization.

This method does not associate the new project with a billing account.
You can set or update the billing account associated with a project using
the [`projects.updateBillingInfo`]
(/billing/reference/rest/v1/projects/updateBillingInfo) method.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(projectId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Marks the Project identified by the specified
`project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`) for deletion.
This method will only affect the Project if it has a lifecycle state of
ACTIVE.

This method changes the Project's lifecycle state from
ACTIVE
to DELETE_REQUESTED.
The deletion starts at an unspecified time, at which point the project is
no longer accessible.

Until the deletion completes, you can check the lifecycle state
checked by retrieving the Project with GetProject,
and the Project remains visible to ListProjects.
However, you cannot update the project.

After the deletion completes, the Project is not retrievable by
the  GetProject
and ListProjects
methods.

The caller must have modify permissions for this Project.

Args:
  projectId: string, The Project ID (for example, `foo-bar-123`).

Required. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Projects that the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.get`
permission on and satisfy the specified filter.

This method returns Projects in an unspecified order.
This method is eventually consistent with project mutations; this means
that a newly created project may not appear in the results or recent
updates to an existing project may not be reflected in the results. To
retrieve the latest state of a project, use the
GetProject method.

NOTE: If the request filter contains a `parent.type` and `parent.id` and
the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the
parent, the results will be drawn from an alternate index which provides
more consistent results. In future versions of this API, this List method
will be split into List and Search to properly capture the behavorial
difference.

Args:
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of Projects to return in the response.
The server can return fewer Projects than requested.
If unspecified, server picks an appropriate default.

Optional.
  pageToken: string, A pagination token returned from a previous call to ListProjects
that indicates from where listing should continue.

Optional.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, An expression for filtering the results of the request.  Filter rules are
case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are:

+ `name`
+ `id`
+ `labels.&lt;key&gt;` (where *key* is the name of a label)
+ `parent.type`
+ `parent.id`

Some examples of using labels as filters:

| Filter           | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| name:how*        | The project's name starts with "how".               |
| name:Howl        | The project's name is `Howl` or `howl`.             |
| name:HOWL        | Equivalent to above.                                |
| NAME:howl        | Equivalent to above.                                |
| labels.color:*   | The project has the label `color`.                  |
| labels.color:red | The project's label `color` has the value `red`.    |
| labels.color:red&amp;nbsp;labels.size:big |The project's label `color` has
  the value `red` and its label `size` has the value `big`.              |

If no filter is specified, the call will return projects for which the user
has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission.

NOTE: To perform a by-parent query (eg., what projects are directly in a
Folder), the caller must have the `resourcemanager.projects.list`
permission on the parent and the filter must contain both a `parent.type`
and a `parent.id` restriction
(example: "parent.type:folder parent.id:123"). In this case an alternate
search index is used which provides more consistent results.

Optional.

      # ListProjects
      # method.
      #

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified Project. Overwrites
any existing policy.

The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`:

+ Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as
`members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`.

+ The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group
that is part of an organization. For example,
group@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in
the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com
organization.

+ Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly
without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be
invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.

+ A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user
must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must
explicitly accept the invitation.

+ Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using
`setIamPolicy()`; they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console.

+ Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have
accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.

+ If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least
one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the
policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner
from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy
projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to
IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is
rectified.

+ This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used to
append additional IAM settings.

Note: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles
can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand
how the service account is being used before removing or updating its
roles.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
    "policy": { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`. The size of
        # the policy is limited to a few 10s of KB. An empty policy is a

        # might reject them.

        #
        #
        # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
        # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
        # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
        # request, the resource, or both.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
      # request, the resource, or both.
