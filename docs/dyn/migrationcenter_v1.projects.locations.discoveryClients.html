  <pre>Creates a new discovery client.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents an installed Migration Center Discovery Client instance.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the discovery client was first created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Free text description. Maximum length is 1000 characters.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Free text display name. Maximum length is 63 characters.
  &quot;errors&quot;: [ # Output only. Errors affecting client functionality.
    { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
      &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {
          &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
    },
  ],
  &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Client expiration time in UTC. If specified, the backend will not accept new frames after this time.
  &quot;heartbeatTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last heartbeat time. Healthy clients are expected to send heartbeats regularly (normally every few minutes).
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels as key value pairs.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Identifier. Full name of this discovery client.
  &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Service account used by the discovery client for various operation.
  &quot;signalsEndpoint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. This field is intended for internal use.
  &quot;source&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. Full name of the source object associated with this discovery client.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Current state of the discovery client.
  &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Input only. Client time-to-live. If specified, the backend will not accept new frames after this time. This field is input only. The derived expiration time is provided as output through the `expire_time` field.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the discovery client was last updated. This value is not updated by heartbeats, to view the last heartbeat time please refer to the `heartbeat_time` field.
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Client version, as reported in recent heartbeat.
}

  discoveryClientId: string, Required. User specified ID for the discovery client. It will become the last component of the discovery client name. The ID must be unique within the project, is restricted to lower-cased letters and has a maximum length of 63 characters. The ID must match the regular expression: `[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?`.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Update mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `DiscoveryClient` resource by the update. The values specified in the `update_mask` field are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. A single * value in the mask lets you to overwrite all fields.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
