Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for client status of clients identified by a list of NodeMatchers.
  &quot;excludeResourceContents&quot;: True or False, # If true, the server will not include the resource contents in the response (i.e., the generic_xds_configs.xds_config field will not be populated). [#not-implemented-hide:]
  &quot;node&quot;: { # Identifies a specific Envoy instance. The node identifier is presented to the management server, which may use this identifier to distinguish per Envoy configuration for serving. [#next-free-field: 13] # The node making the csds request.
    &quot;clientFeatures&quot;: [ # Client feature support list. These are well known features described in the Envoy API repository for a given major version of an API. Client features use reverse DNS naming scheme, for example ``com.acme.feature``. See :ref:`the list of features ` that xDS client may support.
      &quot;A String&quot;,

    &quot;cluster&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Defines the local service cluster name where Envoy is running. Though optional, it should be set if any of the following features are used: :ref:`statsd `, :ref:`health check cluster verification `, :ref:`runtime override directory `, :ref:`user agent addition `, :ref:`HTTP global rate limiting `, :ref:`CDS `, and :ref:`HTTP tracing `, either in this message or via :option:`--service-cluster`.
    &quot;dynamicParameters&quot;: { # Map from xDS resource type URL to dynamic context parameters. These may vary at runtime (unlike other fields in this message). For example, the xDS client may have a shard identifier that changes during the lifetime of the xDS client. In Envoy, this would be achieved by updating the dynamic context on the Server::Instance&#x27;s LocalInfo context provider. The shard ID dynamic parameter then appears in this field during future discovery requests.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: { # Additional parameters that can be used to select resource variants. These include any global context parameters, per-resource type client feature capabilities and per-resource type functional attributes. All per-resource type attributes will be `xds.resource.` prefixed and some of these are documented below: `xds.resource.listening_address`: The value is &quot;IP:port&quot; (e.g. &quot;10.1.1.3:8080&quot;) which is the listening address of a Listener.
