  <pre>Updates inventory information for a Product while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update is enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. When inventory is updated with ProductService.CreateProduct and ProductService.UpdateProduct, the specified inventory field value(s) overwrite any existing value(s) while ignoring the last update time for this field. Furthermore, the last update times for the specified inventory fields are overwritten by the times of the ProductService.CreateProduct or ProductService.UpdateProduct request. If no inventory fields are set in CreateProductRequest.product, then any pre-existing inventory information for this product is used. If no inventory fields are set in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask, then any existing inventory information is preserved. Pre-existing inventory information can only be updated with ProductService.SetInventory, ProductService.AddFulfillmentPlaces, and ProductService.RemoveFulfillmentPlaces. The returned Operations is obsolete after one day, and the GetOperation API returns `NOT_FOUND` afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates are not marked as done until they are obsolete.

Args:
  name: string, Immutable. Full resource name of the product, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/default_branch/products/product_id`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for ProductService.SetInventory method.
  &quot;allowMissing&quot;: True or False, # If set to true, and the Product with name Product.name is not found, the inventory update will still be processed and retained for at most 1 day until the Product is created. If set to false, a NOT_FOUND error is returned if the Product is not found.
  &quot;inventory&quot;: { # Product captures all metadata information of items to be recommended or searched. # Required. The inventory information to update. The allowable fields to update are: * Product.price_info * Product.availability * Product.available_quantity * Product.fulfillment_info The updated inventory fields must be specified in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask. If SetInventoryRequest.inventory.name is empty or invalid, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. If the caller does not have permission to update the Product named in Product.name, regardless of whether or not it exists, a PERMISSION_DENIED error is returned. If the Product to update does not have existing inventory information, the provided inventory information will be inserted. If the Product to update has existing inventory information, the provided inventory information will be merged while respecting the last update time for each inventory field, using the provided or default value for SetInventoryRequest.set_time. The caller can replace place IDs for a subset of fulfillment types in the following ways: * Adds &quot;fulfillment_info&quot; in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask * Specifies only the desired fulfillment types and corresponding place IDs to update in SetInventoryRequest.inventory.fulfillment_info The caller can clear all place IDs from a subset of fulfillment types in the following ways: * Adds &quot;fulfillment_info&quot; in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask * Specifies only the desired fulfillment types to clear in SetInventoryRequest.inventory.fulfillment_info * Checks that only the desired fulfillment info types have empty SetInventoryRequest.inventory.fulfillment_info.place_ids The last update time is recorded for the following inventory fields: * Product.price_info * Product.availability * Product.available_quantity * Product.fulfillment_info If a full overwrite of inventory information while ignoring timestamps is needed, ProductService.UpdateProduct should be invoked instead.

Two types of features can be set are: Textual features. some examples would be the brand/maker of a product, or country of a customer. Numerical features. Some examples would be the height/weight of a product, or age of a customer.

This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned: * Max entries count: 200. * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. * For indexable attribute, the key must match the pattern: `a-zA-Z0-9*`.
