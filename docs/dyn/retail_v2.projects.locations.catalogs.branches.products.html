Args:
  product: string, Required. Full resource name of Product, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/default_branch/products/some_product_id`.

Each value must be a string with a length limit of 10 characters, matching the pattern `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`, such as &quot;store1&quot; or &quot;REGION-2&quot;. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. If the total number of place IDs exceeds 2000 for this type after adding, then the update will be rejected.
    &quot;A String&quot;,

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
