<p class="firstline">Updates the specified agent environment. This method allows you to deploy new agent versions into the environment. When an environment is pointed to a new agent version by setting `environment.agent_version`, the environment is temporarily set to the `LOADING` state. During that time, the environment continues serving the previous version of the agent. After the new agent version is done loading, the environment is set back to the `RUNNING` state. You can use "-" as Environment ID in environment name to update an agent version in the default environment. WARNING: this will negate all recent changes to the draft agent and can't be undone. You may want to save the draft agent to a version before calling this method.</p>

  <pre>Creates an agent environment.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The agent to create an environment for. Supported formats: - `projects//agent` - `projects//locations//agent` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # You can create multiple versions of your agent and publish them to separate environments. When you edit an agent, you are editing the draft agent. At any point, you can save the draft agent as an agent version, which is an immutable snapshot of your agent. When you save the draft agent, it is published to the default environment. When you create agent versions, you can publish them to custom environments. You can create a variety of custom environments for: - testing - development - production - etc. For more information, see the [versions and environments guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-versions).
  &quot;agentVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The agent version loaded into this environment. Supported formats: - `projects//agent/versions/` - `projects//locations//agent/versions/`

  &quot;fulfillment&quot;: { # By default, your agent responds to a matched intent with a static response. As an alternative, you can provide a more dynamic response by using fulfillment. When you enable fulfillment for an intent, Dialogflow responds to that intent by calling a service that you define. For example, if an end-user wants to schedule a haircut on Friday, your service can check your database and respond to the end-user with availability information for Friday. For more information, see the [fulfillment guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-overview). # Optional. The fulfillment settings to use for this environment.
    &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The human-readable name of the fulfillment, unique within the agent. This field is not used for Fulfillment in an Environment.
    &quot;enabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether fulfillment is enabled.
    &quot;features&quot;: [ # Optional. The field defines whether the fulfillment is enabled for certain features.
      { # Whether fulfillment is enabled for the specific feature.
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of the feature that enabled for fulfillment.

Dialogflow supports two mechanisms for authentications: - Basic authentication with username and password. - Authentication with additional authentication headers. More information could be found at: https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-configure. # Configuration for a generic web service.
      &quot;isCloudFunction&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if generic web service is created through Cloud Functions integration. Defaults to false. is_cloud_function is deprecated. Cloud functions can be configured by its uri as a regular web service now.

    &quot;enableTextToSpeech&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether text to speech is enabled. Even when this field is false, other settings in this proto are still retained.
    &quot;outputAudioEncoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content.
    &quot;sampleRateHertz&quot;: 42, # Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice&#x27;s natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality).

        ],
        &quot;pitch&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch.
        &quot;speakingRate&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values &lt; 0.25 or &gt; 4.0 will return an error.
        &quot;voice&quot;: { # Description of which voice to use for speech synthesis. # Optional. The desired voice of the synthesized audio.
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender.
          &quot;ssmlGender&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.
        },
        &quot;volumeGainDb&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there&#x27;s usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that.
      },

  <pre>Updates the specified agent environment. This method allows you to deploy new agent versions into the environment. When an environment is pointed to a new agent version by setting `environment.agent_version`, the environment is temporarily set to the `LOADING` state.

You can use &quot;-&quot; as Environment ID in environment name to update an agent version in the default environment. WARNING: this will negate all recent changes to the draft agent and can&#x27;t be undone. You may want to save the draft agent to a version before calling this method.

          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender.
          &quot;ssmlGender&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.

        &quot;volumeGainDb&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there&#x27;s usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that.
