  <pre>Creates a log bucket that can be used to store log entries. After a bucket has been created, the bucket&#x27;s location cannot be changed.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource in which to create the log bucket: &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]&quot; For example:&quot;projects/my-project/locations/global&quot; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a repository in which log entries are stored.
  &quot;analyticsEnabled&quot;: True or False, # Whether log analytics is enabled for this bucket.Once enabled, log analytics features cannot be disabled.
  &quot;cmekSettings&quot;: { # Describes the customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) settings associated with a project, folder, organization, billing account, or flexible resource.Note: CMEK for the Log Router can currently only be configured for Google Cloud organizations. Once configured, it applies to all projects and folders in the Google Cloud organization.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information. # Optional. The CMEK settings of the log bucket. If present, new log entries written to this log bucket are encrypted using the CMEK key provided in this configuration. If a log bucket has CMEK settings, the CMEK settings cannot be disabled later by updating the log bucket. Changing the KMS key is allowed.
    &quot;kmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The resource name for the configured Cloud KMS key.KMS key name format: &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY]&quot; For example:&quot;projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/keyRings/my-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key&quot;To enable CMEK for the Log Router, set this field to a valid kms_key_name for which the associated service account has the needed cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter roles assigned for the key.The Cloud KMS key used by the Log Router can be updated by changing the kms_key_name to a new valid key name or disabled by setting the key name to an empty string. Encryption operations that are in progress will be completed with the key that was in use when they started. Decryption operations will be completed using the key that was used at the time of encryption unless access to that key has been revoked.To disable CMEK for the Log Router, set this field to an empty string.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.
    &quot;kmsKeyVersionName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The CryptoKeyVersion resource name for the configured Cloud KMS key.KMS key name format: &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY]/cryptoKeyVersions/[VERSION]&quot; For example:&quot;projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/keyRings/my-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1&quot;This is a read-only field used to convey the specific configured CryptoKeyVersion of kms_key that has been configured. It will be populated in cases where the CMEK settings are bound to a single key version.If this field is populated, the kms_key is tied to a specific CryptoKeyVersion.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the CMEK settings.
    &quot;serviceAccountId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The service account that will be used by the Log Router to access your Cloud KMS key.Before enabling CMEK for Log Router, you must first assign the cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter role to the service account that the Log Router will use to access your Cloud KMS key. Use GetCmekSettings to obtain the service account ID.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.

Once configured, it applies to all projects and folders in the Google Cloud organization.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information. # Optional. The CMEK settings of the log bucket. If present, new log entries written to this log bucket are encrypted using the CMEK key provided in this configuration. If a log bucket has CMEK settings, the CMEK settings cannot be disabled later by updating the log bucket. Changing the KMS key is allowed.
    &quot;kmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The resource name for the configured Cloud KMS key.KMS key name format: &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY]&quot; For example:&quot;projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/keyRings/my-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key&quot;To enable CMEK for the Log Router, set this field to a valid kms_key_name for which the associated service account has the needed cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter roles assigned for the key.The Cloud KMS key used by the Log Router can be updated by changing the kms_key_name to a new valid key name or disabled by setting the key name to an empty string. Encryption operations that are in progress will be completed with the key that was in use when they started. Decryption operations will be completed using the key that was used at the time of encryption unless access to that key has been revoked.To disable CMEK for the Log Router, set this field to an empty string.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.
    &quot;kmsKeyVersionName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The CryptoKeyVersion resource name for the configured Cloud KMS key.KMS key name format: &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY]/cryptoKeyVersions/[VERSION]&quot; For example:&quot;projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/keyRings/my-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key/cryptoKeyVersions/1&quot;This is a read-only field used to convey the specific configured CryptoKeyVersion of kms_key that has been configured. It will be populated in cases where the CMEK settings are bound to a single key version.If this field is populated, the kms_key is tied to a specific CryptoKeyVersion.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the CMEK settings.
    &quot;serviceAccountId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The service account that will be used by the Log Router to access your Cloud KMS key.Before enabling CMEK for Log Router, you must first assign the cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter role to the service account that the Log Router will use to access your Cloud KMS key. Use GetCmekSettings to obtain the service account ID.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.

  &quot;restrictedFields&quot;: [ # Optional. Log entry field paths that are denied access in this bucket.The following fields and their children are eligible: textPayload, jsonPayload, protoPayload, httpRequest, labels, sourceLocation.Restricting a repeated field will restrict all values. Adding a parent will block all child fields. (e.g. foo.bar will block foo.bar.baz)

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC (https://github.com/grpc). Each Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the API Design Guide (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should be a resource name ending with operations/{unique_id}.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete, the response is google.protobuf.Empty. If the original method is standard Get/Create/Update, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse, where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot(), the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse.
