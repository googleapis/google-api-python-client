<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="search">search(parent, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, query=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>SearchFindings is a more powerful version of ListFindings that supports complex queries like &quot;findings for issues&quot; using functions such as `has_issue` and `has_asset` in the query string. Example to search for findings for a specific issue: `has_issue(&quot;name=\&quot;vaults/vault-12345/issues/issue-12345\&quot;&quot;)`)

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent of the findings. Format: vaults/{vault} (required)
  orderBy: string, Optional. Order by criteria in the csv format: &quot;field1,field2 desc&quot; or &quot;field1,field2&quot; or &quot;field1 asc, field2&quot;.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. Page size.
  pageToken: string, Optional. Page token.
  query: string, Optional. Query on what findings will be returned. This supports the same filter criteria as FindingService.ListFindings as well as the following relationship queries `has_issue` and `has_asset`. Examples: - has_issue(&quot;name=\&quot;vaults/vault-12345/issues/issue-12345\&quot;&quot;) - has_asset(&quot;name=\&quot;vaults/vault-12345/assets/asset-12345\&quot;&quot;)
