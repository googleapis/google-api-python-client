  <pre>Creates a consumer property. If the property already exists, this method fails with an ALREADY_EXISTS error. For this failure case, the Status details field will contain the existing property&#x27;s value.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the property to create. An example name would be: `services/serviceconsumermanagement.googleapis.com/projects/123` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A property assigned to a consumer of a service.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The description of the property.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of this property. An example name would be: `services/serviceconsumermanagement.googleapis.com/projects/123/properties/SERVICE_LEVEL` The resource name is intended to be opaque and should not be parsed for its component strings, since its representation could change in the future.
  &quot;propagation&quot;: { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call. # Output only. A long-running operation which tracks the propagation of recent changes to this resource to all affected backends. If this field is empty, all affected backends have been notified of the change. If this field contains an operation in progress, then the most recent change to this resource has not yet been sent out to all backends. If this field contains an operation that has failed with an error, the caller should retry the change.
    &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
    &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
      &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {
          &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
    },
    &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
    &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
  },
  &quot;propertyKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the property as it appears in the service configuration. An example property name would be: `SERVICE_LEVEL`
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The type of this property.
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Value of this property for the consumer. This field may be empty if the consumer has not been assigned a value.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
