  <pre>Creates a new DnsAuthorization in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the dns authorization. Must be in the format `projects/*/locations/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A DnsAuthorization resource describes a way to perform domain authorization for certificate issuance.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The creation timestamp of a DnsAuthorization.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # One or more paragraphs of text description of a DnsAuthorization.

    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Type of the DNS Resource Record. Currently always set to &quot;CNAME&quot;.
  },
  &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. A domain which is being authorized. A DnsAuthorization resource covers a single domain and its wildcard, e.g. authorization for `example.com` can be used to issue certificates for `example.com` and `*.example.com`.

    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
