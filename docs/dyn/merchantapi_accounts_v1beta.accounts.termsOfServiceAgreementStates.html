The state is as follows: * If the merchant has accepted a terms of service: [accepted](TermsOfServiceAggrementState.accepted) will be populated, otherwise it will be empty * If the merchant must sign a terms of service: [required](TermsOfServiceAggrementState.required) will be populated, otherwise it will be empty. Note that both [required](TermsOfServiceAggrementState.required) and [accepted](TermsOfServiceAggrementState.accepted) can be present.
