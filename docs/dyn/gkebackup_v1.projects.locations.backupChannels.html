<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, backupChannelId=None, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new BackupChannel in a given location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The location within which to create the BackupChannel. Format: `projects/*/locations/*` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A BackupChannel imposes constraints on where clusters can be backed up. The BackupChannel should be in the same project and region as the cluster being backed up. The backup can be created only in destination_project.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this BackupChannel resource was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. User specified descriptive string for this BackupChannel.
  &quot;destinationProject&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The project where Backups are allowed to be stored. The format is `projects/{projectId}` or `projects/{projectNumber}`.
  &quot;destinationProjectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The project_id where Backups are allowed to be stored. Example Project ID: &quot;my-project-id&quot;. This will be an OUTPUT_ONLY field to return the project_id of the destination project.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a BackupChannel from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the &#x27;etag&#x27; in the read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupChannel updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetBackupChannel`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `UpdateBackupChannel` or `DeleteBackupChannel` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. A set of custom labels supplied by user.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The fully qualified name of the BackupChannel. `projects/*/locations/*/backupChannels/*`
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Server generated global unique identifier of [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) format.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this BackupChannel resource was last updated.
}

  backupChannelId: string, Optional. The client-provided short name for the BackupChannel resource. This name must: - be between 1 and 63 characters long (inclusive) - consist of only lower-case ASCII letters, numbers, and dashes - start with a lower-case letter - end with a lower-case letter or number - be unique within the set of BackupChannels in this location If the user does not provide a name, a uuid will be used as the name.
