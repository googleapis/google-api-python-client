  <pre>Allocate IDs for incomplete keys (useful for referencing an entity before it is inserted).

Args:
  datasetId: string, Identifies the dataset. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "keys": [ # A list of keys with incomplete key paths to allocate IDs for. No key may be reserved/read-only.
      {
        "path": [ # The entity path. An entity path consists of one or more elements composed of a kind and a string or numerical identifier, which identify entities. The first element identifies a root entity, the second element identifies a child of the root entity, the third element a child of the second entity, and so forth. The entities identified by all prefixes of the path are called the element's ancestors. An entity path is always fully complete: ALL of the entity's ancestors are required to be in the path along with the entity identifier itself. The only exception is that in some documented cases, the identifier in the last path element (for the entity) itself may be omitted. A path can never be empty.
          { # A (kind, ID/name) pair used to construct a key path.
              #
              # At most one of name or ID may be set. If either is set, the element is complete. If neither is set, the element is incomplete.
            "kind": "A String", # The kind of the entity. Kinds matching regex "__.*__" are reserved/read-only. Cannot be "".
            "id": "A String", # The ID of the entity. Always > 0.
            "name": "A String", # The name of the entity. Names matching regex "__.*__" are reserved/read-only. Cannot be "".
          },
        ],
        "partitionId": { # Entities are partitioned into subsets, currently identified by a dataset (usually implicitly specified by the project) and namespace ID. Queries are scoped to a single partition.
          "namespace": "A String", # The namespace.
          "datasetId": "A String", # The dataset ID.
        },

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="beginTransaction">beginTransaction(datasetId, body)</code>
  <pre>Begin a new transaction.

Args:
  datasetId: string, Identifies the dataset. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "isolationLevel": "A String", # The transaction isolation level. Either snapshot or serializable. The default isolation level is snapshot isolation, which means that another transaction may not concurrently modify the data that is modified by this transaction. Optionally, a transaction can request to be made serializable which means that another transaction cannot concurrently modify the data that is read or modified by this transaction.
