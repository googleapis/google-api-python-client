  <pre>Allocate IDs for incomplete keys (useful for referencing an entity before it is inserted).

Args:
  datasetId: string, Identifies the dataset. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "keys": [ # A list of keys with incomplete key paths to allocate IDs for. No key may be reserved/read-only.
      { # A unique identifier for an entity.
        "path": [ # The entity path. An entity path consists of one or more elements composed of a kind and a string or numerical identifier, which identify entities. The first element identifies a root entity, the second element identifies a child of the root entity, the third element a child of the second entity, and so forth. The entities identified by all prefixes of the path are called the element's ancestors. An entity path is always fully complete: ALL of the entity's ancestors are required to be in the path along with the entity identifier itself. The only exception is that in some documented cases, the identifier in the last path element (for the entity) itself may be omitted. A path can never be empty. The path can have at most 100 elements.
          { # A (kind, ID/name) pair used to construct a key path.
              #
              # At most one of name or ID may be set. If either is set, the element is complete. If neither is set, the element is incomplete.
            "kind": "A String", # The kind of the entity. A kind matching regex "__.*__" is reserved/read-only. A kind must not contain more than 500 characters. Cannot be "".
            "id": "A String", # The ID of the entity. Never equal to zero. Values less than zero are discouraged and will not be supported in the future.
            "name": "A String", # The name of the entity. A name matching regex "__.*__" is reserved/read-only. A name must not be more than 500 characters. Cannot be "".
          },
        ],
        "partitionId": { # An identifier for a particular subset of entities. # Entities are partitioned into subsets, currently identified by a dataset (usually implicitly specified by the project) and namespace ID. Queries are scoped to a single partition.
            #
            # Entities are partitioned into various subsets, each used by different datasets and different namespaces within a dataset and so forth.
          "namespace": "A String", # The namespace.
          "datasetId": "A String", # The dataset ID.
        },
      },

  }


Returns:

  <pre>Begin a new transaction.

Args:

    The object takes the form of:
