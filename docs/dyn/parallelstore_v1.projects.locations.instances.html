  <pre>Creates a Parallelstore instance in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The instance&#x27;s project and location, in the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. Locations map to Google Cloud zones; for example, `us-west1-b`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Parallelstore instance.
  &quot;accessPoints&quot;: [ # Output only. A list of IPv4 addresses used for client side configuration.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;capacityGib&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The instance&#x27;s storage capacity in Gibibytes (GiB). Allowed values are between 12000 and 100000, in multiples of 4000; e.g., 12000, 16000, 20000, ...
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the instance was created.
  &quot;deploymentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The deployment type of the instance. Allowed values are: * `SCRATCH`: the instance is a scratch instance. * `PERSISTENT`: the instance is a persistent instance.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The description of the instance. 2048 characters or less.
  &quot;directoryStripeLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Stripe level for directories. Allowed values are: * `DIRECTORY_STRIPE_LEVEL_MIN`: recommended when directories contain a small number of files. * `DIRECTORY_STRIPE_LEVEL_BALANCED`: balances performance for workloads involving a mix of small and large directories. * `DIRECTORY_STRIPE_LEVEL_MAX`: recommended for directories with a large number of files.
  &quot;effectiveReservedIpRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. The ID of the IP address range being used by the instance&#x27;s VPC network. This field is populated by the service and contains the value currently used by the service.
  &quot;fileStripeLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Stripe level for files. Allowed values are: * `FILE_STRIPE_LEVEL_MIN`: offers the best performance for small size files. * `FILE_STRIPE_LEVEL_BALANCED`: balances performance for workloads involving a mix of small and large files. * `FILE_STRIPE_LEVEL_MAX`: higher throughput performance for larger files.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer&#x27;s organizational needs and deployment strategies. See https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/labels-overview for details.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The resource name of the instance, in the format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance_id}`.
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Immutable. The name of the Compute Engine [VPC network](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc) to which the instance is connected.
  &quot;reservedIpRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Immutable. The ID of the IP address range being used by the instance&#x27;s VPC network. See [Configure a VPC network](https://cloud.google.com/parallelstore/docs/vpc#create_and_configure_the_vpc). If no ID is provided, all ranges are considered.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The instance state.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the instance was updated.
}

  instanceId: string, Required. The name of the Parallelstore instance. * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. * Must start with a letter. * Must be between 1-63 characters. * Must end with a number or a letter. * Must be unique within the customer project / location
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Mask of fields to update. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Instance resource by the update. At least one path must be supplied in this field. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
