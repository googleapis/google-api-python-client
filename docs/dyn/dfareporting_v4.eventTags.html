When set to false, the parent advertiser and parent campaign of the specified ad or campaign is examined as well. In addition, when set to false, the status field is examined as well, along with the enabledByDefault field. This parameter can not be set to true when adId is specified as ads do not define their own even tags.
  enabled: boolean, Select only enabled event tags. What is considered enabled or disabled depends on the definitionsOnly parameter. When definitionsOnly is set to true, only the specified advertiser or campaign&#x27;s event tags&#x27; enabledByDefault field is examined.

Most of the searches also add wildcards implicitly at the start and the end of the search string. For example, a search string of &quot;eventtag&quot; will match objects with name &quot;my eventtag&quot;, &quot;eventtag 2015&quot;, or simply &quot;eventtag&quot;.
