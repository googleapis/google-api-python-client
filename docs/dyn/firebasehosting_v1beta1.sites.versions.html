Args:
  parent: string, Required. The target site for the cloned version, in the format: sites/ SITE_ID (required)

    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
