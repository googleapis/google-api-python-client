  <pre>Atomically updates the ResourceRecordSet collection.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)
  managedZone: string, Identifies the managed zone addressed by this request. Can be the managed zone name or ID. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(project, managedZone, changeId, clientOperationId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Fetches the representation of an existing Change.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)
  managedZone: string, Identifies the managed zone addressed by this request. Can be the managed zone name or ID. (required)
  changeId: string, The identifier of the requested change, from a previous ResourceRecordSetsChangeResponse. (required)
  clientOperationId: string, For mutating operation requests only. An optional identifier specified by the client. Must be unique for operation resources in the Operations collection.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  <pre>Enumerates Changes to a ResourceRecordSet collection.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)
  managedZone: string, Identifies the managed zone addressed by this request. Can be the managed zone name or ID. (required)
  maxResults: integer, Optional. Maximum number of results to be returned. If unspecified, the server decides how many results to return.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A tag returned by a previous list request that was truncated. Use this parameter to continue a previous list request.
  sortBy: string, Sorting criterion. The only supported value is change sequence.
    Allowed values
      changeSequence - 
  sortOrder: string, Sorting order direction: &#x27;ascending&#x27; or &#x27;descending&#x27;.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
