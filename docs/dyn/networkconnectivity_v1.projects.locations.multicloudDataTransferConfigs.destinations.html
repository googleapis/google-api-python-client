  <pre>Creates a `Destination` resource in a specified project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the parent resource. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The `Destination` resource. It specifies the IP prefix and the associated autonomous system numbers (ASN) that you want to include in a `MulticloudDataTransferConfig` resource.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the `Destination` resource was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of this resource.
  &quot;endpoints&quot;: [ # Required. Unordered list. The list of `DestinationEndpoint` resources configured for the IP prefix.
    { # The metadata for a `DestinationEndpoint` resource.
      &quot;asn&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The ASN of the remote IP prefix.
      &quot;csp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The CSP of the remote IP prefix.
      &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the `DestinationEndpoint` resource.
      &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the `DestinationEndpoint` resource was updated.
    },
  ],
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The etag is computed by the server, and might be sent with update and delete requests so that the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;ipPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The IP prefix that represents your workload on another CSP.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. User-defined labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The name of the `Destination` resource. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/multicloudDataTransferConfigs/{multicloud_data_transfer_config}/destinations/{destination}`.
  &quot;stateTimeline&quot;: { # The timeline of the pending states for a resource. # Output only. The timeline of the expected `Destination` states or the current rest state. If a state change is expected, the value is `ADDING`, `DELETING` or `SUSPENDING`, depending on the action specified. Example: &quot;state_timeline&quot;: { &quot;states&quot;: [ { // The time when the `Destination` resource will be activated. &quot;effectiveTime&quot;: &quot;2024-12-01T08:00:00Z&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;ADDING&quot; }, { // The time when the `Destination` resource will be suspended. &quot;effectiveTime&quot;: &quot;2024-12-01T20:00:00Z&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;SUSPENDING&quot; } ] }
    &quot;states&quot;: [ # Output only. The state and activation time details of the resource state.
      { # The state and activation time details of the resource state.
        &quot;effectiveTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Accompanies only the transient states, which include `ADDING`, `DELETING`, and `SUSPENDING`, to denote the time until which the transient state of the resource will be effective. For instance, if the state is `ADDING`, this field shows the time when the resource state transitions to `ACTIVE`.
        &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the resource.
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The Google-generated unique ID for the `Destination` resource. This value is unique across all `Destination` resources. If a resource is deleted and another with the same name is created, the new resource is assigned a different and unique ID.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the `Destination` resource was updated.
}

  destinationId: string, Required. The ID to use for the `Destination` resource, which becomes the final component of the `Destination` resource name.
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server can ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server waits for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, can ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate `Destination` resources. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) isn&#x27;t supported.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

        &quot;effectiveTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Accompanies only the transient states, which include `ADDING`, `DELETING`, and `SUSPENDING`, to denote the time until which the transient state of the resource will be effective. For instance, if the state is `ADDING`, this field shows the time when the resource state transitions to `ACTIVE`.
        &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the resource.
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The Google-generated unique ID for the `Destination` resource. This value is unique across all `Destination` resources. If a resource is deleted and another with the same name is created, the new resource is assigned a different and unique ID.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the `Destination` resource was updated.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server can ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server waits for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, can ignore the second request. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) isn&#x27;t supported.
  updateMask: string, Optional. `FieldMask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `Destination` resource by the update. The fields specified in `update_mask` are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field is overwritten if it is in the mask. If you don&#x27;t specify a mask, all fields are overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
