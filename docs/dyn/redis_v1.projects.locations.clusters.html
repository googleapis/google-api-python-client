  <pre>Backup Redis Cluster. If this is the first time a backup is being created, a backup collection will be created at the backend, and this backup belongs to this collection. Both collection and backup will have a resource name. Backup will be executed for each shard. A replica (primary if nonHA) will be selected to perform the execution. Backup call will be rejected if there is an ongoing backup or update operation. Be aware that during preview, if the cluster&#x27;s internal software version is too old, critical update will be performed before actual backup. Once the internal software version is updated to the minimum version required by the backup feature, subsequent backups will not require critical update. After preview, there will be no critical update needed for backup.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Redis cluster resource name using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/clusters/{cluster_id}` where `location_id` refers to a GCP region. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for [BackupCluster].
  &quot;backupId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The id of the backup to be created. If not specified, the default value ([YYYYMMDDHHMMSS]_[Shortened Cluster UID] is used.

}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

Operations that have successfully been cancelled have Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`. `apiVersion`: API version used to start the operation. }
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
