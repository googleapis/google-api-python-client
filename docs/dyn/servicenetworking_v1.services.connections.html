<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a private connection that establishes a VPC Network Peering
connection to a VPC network in the service producer's organization.
The administrator of the service consumer's VPC network invokes this
method. The administrator must assign one or more allocated IP ranges for
provisioning subnetworks in the service producer's VPC network. This
connection is used for all supported services in the service producer's
organization, so it only needs to be invoked once. The response from the
`get` operation will be of type `Connection` if the operation successfully
completes.

Args:
  parent: string, The service that is managing peering connectivity for a service producer's
organization. For Google services that support this functionality, this
value is `services/servicenetworking.googleapis.com`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a private connection resource. A private connection is implemented
      # as a VPC Network Peering connection between a service producer's VPC network
      # and a service consumer's VPC network.

        # service producer.
    "reservedPeeringRanges": [ # The name of one or more allocated IP address ranges for this service
        # producer of type `PEERING`.
        # Note that invoking CreateConnection method with a different range when
        # connection is already established will not modify already provisioned
        # service producer subnetworks.
        # If CreateConnection method is invoked repeatedly to reconnect when peering
        # connection had been disconnected on the consumer side, leaving this field
        # empty will restore previously allocated IP ranges.
