<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a private connection that establishes a VPC Network Peering
connection to a VPC network in the service producer&#x27;s organization.
The administrator of the service consumer&#x27;s VPC network invokes this
method. The administrator must assign one or more allocated IP ranges for
provisioning subnetworks in the service producer&#x27;s VPC network. This
connection is used for all supported services in the service producer&#x27;s
organization, so it only needs to be invoked once.

Args:
  parent: string, The service that is managing peering connectivity for a service producer&#x27;s
organization. For Google services that support this functionality, this
value is `services/servicenetworking.googleapis.com`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    # as a VPC Network Peering connection between a service producer&#x27;s VPC network
    # and a service consumer&#x27;s VPC network.

      # connection is already established will not modify already provisioned
      # service producer subnetworks.
      # If CreateConnection method is invoked repeatedly to reconnect when peering
      # connection had been disconnected on the consumer side, leaving this field
      # empty will restore previously allocated IP ranges.
