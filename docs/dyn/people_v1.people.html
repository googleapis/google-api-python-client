<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchDeleteContacts">batchDeleteContacts(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Delete a batch of contacts. Any non-contact data will not be deleted. Mutate requests for the same user should be sent sequentially to avoid increased latency and failures.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request to delete a batch of existing contacts.
  &quot;resourceNames&quot;: [ # Required. The resource names of the contact to delete. It&#x27;s repeatable. Allows up to 500 resource names in a single request.

  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

    <code class="details" id="listDirectoryPeople">listDirectoryPeople(mergeSources=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, readMask=None, requestSyncToken=None, sources=None, syncToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Provides a list of domain profiles and domain contacts in the authenticated user&#x27;s domain directory. When the `sync_token` is specified, resources deleted since the last sync will be returned as a person with `PersonMetadata.deleted` set to true. When the `page_token` or `sync_token` is specified, all other request parameters must match the first call. Writes may have a propagation delay of several minutes for sync requests. Incremental syncs are not intended for read-after-write use cases. See example usage at [List the directory people that have changed](/people/v1/directory#list_the_directory_people_that_have_changed).

Args:
  mergeSources: string, Optional. Additional data to merge into the directory sources if they are connected through verified join keys such as email addresses or phone numbers. (repeated)
    Allowed values
      DIRECTORY_MERGE_SOURCE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED - Unspecified.
      DIRECTORY_MERGE_SOURCE_TYPE_CONTACT - User owned contact.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The number of people to include in the response. Valid values are between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Defaults to 100 if not set or set to 0.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous response `next_page_token`. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `people.listDirectoryPeople` must match the first call that provided the page token.
  readMask: string, Required. A field mask to restrict which fields on each person are returned. Multiple fields can be specified by separating them with commas. Valid values are: * addresses * ageRanges * biographies * birthdays * calendarUrls * clientData * coverPhotos * emailAddresses * events * externalIds * genders * imClients * interests * locales * locations * memberships * metadata * miscKeywords * names * nicknames * occupations * organizations * phoneNumbers * photos * relations * sipAddresses * skills * urls * userDefined
  requestSyncToken: boolean, Optional. Whether the response should return `next_sync_token`. It can be used to get incremental changes since the last request by setting it on the request `sync_token`. More details about sync behavior at `people.listDirectoryPeople`.
  sources: string, Required. Directory sources to return. (repeated)
    Allowed values
      DIRECTORY_SOURCE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED - Unspecified.
      DIRECTORY_SOURCE_TYPE_DOMAIN_CONTACT - Google Workspace domain shared contact.
      DIRECTORY_SOURCE_TYPE_DOMAIN_PROFILE - Google Workspace domain profile.
  syncToken: string, Optional. A sync token, received from a previous response `next_sync_token` Provide this to retrieve only the resources changed since the last request. When syncing, all other parameters provided to `people.listDirectoryPeople` must match the first call that provided the sync token. More details about sync behavior at `people.listDirectoryPeople`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:

  <pre>Provides a list of contacts in the authenticated user&#x27;s grouped contacts that matches the search query. The query matches on a contact&#x27;s `names`, `nickNames`, `emailAddresses`, `phoneNumbers`, and `organizations` fields that are from the CONTACT source. **IMPORTANT**: Before searching, clients should send a warmup request with an empty query to update the cache. See https://developers.google.com/people/v1/contacts#search_the_users_contacts

  query: string, Required. The plain-text query for the request. The query is used to match prefix phrases of the fields on a person. For example, a person with name &quot;foo name&quot; matches queries such as &quot;f&quot;, &quot;fo&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;foo n&quot;, &quot;nam&quot;, etc., but not &quot;oo n&quot;.
  readMask: string, Required. A field mask to restrict which fields on each person are returned. Multiple fields can be specified by separating them with commas. Valid values are: * addresses * ageRanges * biographies * birthdays * calendarUrls * clientData * coverPhotos * emailAddresses * events * externalIds * genders * imClients * interests * locales * locations * memberships * metadata * miscKeywords * names * nicknames * occupations * organizations * phoneNumbers * photos * relations * sipAddresses * skills * urls * userDefined
  sources: string, Optional. A mask of what source types to return. Defaults to READ_SOURCE_TYPE_CONTACT if not set. (repeated)

  <pre>Update contact data for an existing contact person. Any non-contact data will not be modified. Any non-contact data in the person to update will be ignored.

The server returns a 400 error with reason `&quot;failedPrecondition&quot;` if `person.metadata.sources.etag` is different than the contact&#x27;s etag, which indicates the contact has changed since its data was read. Clients should get the latest person and merge their updates into the latest person. The server returns a 400 error if `memberships` are being updated and there are no contact group memberships specified on the person. The server returns a 400 error if more than one field is specified on a field that is a singleton for contact sources: * biographies * birthdays * genders * names Mutate requests for the same user should be sent sequentially to avoid increased latency and failures.
