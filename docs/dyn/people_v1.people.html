            # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
            # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
            #
            # - Simple to use and understand for most users
            # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
            #
            # # Overview
            #
            # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
            # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
            # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
            # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
            # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
            # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
            # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
            # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
            # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
            #
            # # Language mapping
            #
            # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
            # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
            # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
            # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
            # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
            #
            # # Other uses
            #
            # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
            # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
            # consistent developer experience across different environments.
            #
            # Example uses of this error model include:
            #
            # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
            #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
            #     errors.
            #
            # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
            #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
            #
            # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
            #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
            #     each error sub-response.
            #
            # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
            #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
            #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
            #
            # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
            #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
          "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
              # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
              # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
          "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
          "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There will be a
              # common set of message types for APIs to use.
            {
              "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
            },
