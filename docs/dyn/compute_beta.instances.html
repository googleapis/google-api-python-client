<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addAccessConfig">addAccessConfig(project, zone, instance, networkInterface, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds an access config to an instance&#x27;s network interface.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, The instance name for this request. (required)
  networkInterface: string, The name of the network interface to add to this instance. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An access configuration attached to an instance&#x27;s network interface. Only one access config per instance is supported.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#accessConfig&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#accessConfig for access configs.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of this access configuration. The default and recommended name is External NAT, but you can use any arbitrary string, such as My external IP or Network Access.
  &quot;natIP&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An external IP address associated with this instance. Specify an unused static external IP address available to the project or leave this field undefined to use an IP from a shared ephemeral IP address pool. If you specify a static external IP address, it must live in the same region as the zone of the instance.
  &quot;networkTier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this access configuration and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
      # 
      # If an AccessConfig is specified without a valid external IP address, an ephemeral IP will be created with this networkTier.
      # 
      # If an AccessConfig with a valid external IP address is specified, it must match that of the networkTier associated with the Address resource owning that IP.
  &quot;publicPtrDomainName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The DNS domain name for the public PTR record. You can set this field only if the `setPublicPtr` field is enabled.
  &quot;setPublicPtr&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether a public DNS &#x27;PTR&#x27; record should be created to map the external IP address of the instance to a DNS domain name.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ONE_TO_ONE_NAT&quot;, # The type of configuration. The default and only option is ONE_TO_ONE_NAT.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, filter=None, includeAllScopes=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves aggregated list of all of the instances in your project across all regions and zones.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  includeAllScopes: boolean, Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the logic is the same as today.

  forceAttach: boolean, Whether to force attach the regional disk even if it&#x27;s currently attached to another instance. If you try to force attach a zonal disk to an instance, you will receive an error.
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.
    #

    #
    # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
    #
    # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

      # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

    <code class="details" id="getScreenshot">getScreenshot(project, zone, instance)</code>
  <pre>Returns the screenshot from the specified instance.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance scoping this request. (required)

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An instance&#x27;s screenshot.
  &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The Base64-encoded screenshot data.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getSerialPortOutput">getSerialPortOutput(project, zone, instance, port=None, start=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the last 1 MB of serial port output from the specified instance.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance for this request. (required)
  port: integer, Specifies which COM or serial port to retrieve data from.
  start: string, Specifies the starting byte position of the output to return. To start with the first byte of output to the specified port, omit this field or set it to `0`.

If the output for that byte position is available, this field matches the `start` parameter sent with the request. If the amount of serial console output exceeds the size of the buffer (1 MB), the oldest output is discarded and is no longer available. If the requested start position refers to discarded output, the start position is adjusted to the oldest output still available, and the adjusted start position is returned as the `start` property value.

You can also provide a negative start position, which translates to the most recent number of bytes written to the serial port. For example, -3 is interpreted as the most recent 3 bytes written to the serial console.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An instance&#x27;s serial console output.
  &quot;contents&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The contents of the console output.

  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource.
  &quot;start&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The starting byte position of the output that was returned. This should match the start parameter sent with the request. If the serial console output exceeds the size of the buffer (1 MB), older output is overwritten by newer content. The output start value will indicate the byte position of the output that was returned, which might be different than the `start` value that was specified in the request.

  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the logic is the same as today.

  <pre>Retrieves a list of resources that refer to the VM instance specified in the request. For example, if the VM instance is part of a managed or unmanaged instance group, the referrers list includes the instance group. For more information, read Viewing referrers to VM instances.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the target instance scoping this request, or &#x27;-&#x27; if the request should span over all instances in the container. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the logic is the same as today.

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;resourcePolicies&quot;: [ # Resource policies to be removed from this instance.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setDiskAutoDelete">setDiskAutoDelete(project, zone, instance, autoDelete, deviceName, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the auto-delete flag for a disk attached to an instance.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, The instance name for this request. (required)
  autoDelete: boolean, Whether to auto-delete the disk when the instance is deleted. (required)
  deviceName: string, The device name of the disk to modify. Make a get() request on the instance to view currently attached disks and device names. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    #
    #
    # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
    #
    # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

  <pre>Sets labels on an instance. To learn more about labels, read the Labeling Resources documentation.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance scoping this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;labelFingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Fingerprint of the previous set of labels for this resource, used to prevent conflicts. Provide the latest fingerprint value when making a request to add or change labels.
  &quot;labels&quot;: {
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A metadata key/value entry.
  &quot;fingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the metadata&#x27;s contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change metadata, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.
      # 
      # To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve the resource.

  ],
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#metadata&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#metadata for metadata.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setTags">setTags(project, zone, instance, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets network tags for the specified instance to the data included in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance scoping this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A set of instance tags.
  &quot;fingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the tags&#x27; contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update tags. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change tags.
      # 
      # To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.
  &quot;items&quot;: [ # An array of tags. Each tag must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="updateNetworkInterface">updateNetworkInterface(project, zone, instance, networkInterface, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates an instance&#x27;s network interface. This method follows PATCH semantics.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)

      &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#accessConfig&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#accessConfig for access configs.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of this access configuration. The default and recommended name is External NAT, but you can use any arbitrary string, such as My external IP or Network Access.
      &quot;natIP&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An external IP address associated with this instance. Specify an unused static external IP address available to the project or leave this field undefined to use an IP from a shared ephemeral IP address pool. If you specify a static external IP address, it must live in the same region as the zone of the instance.
      &quot;networkTier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this access configuration and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
          #
          # If an AccessConfig is specified without a valid external IP address, an ephemeral IP will be created with this networkTier.
          #
          # If an AccessConfig with a valid external IP address is specified, it must match that of the networkTier associated with the Address resource owning that IP.
      &quot;publicPtrDomainName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The DNS domain name for the public PTR record. You can set this field only if the `setPublicPtr` field is enabled.

      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ONE_TO_ONE_NAT&quot;, # The type of configuration. The default and only option is ONE_TO_ONE_NAT.
    },
  ],
  &quot;aliasIpRanges&quot;: [ # An array of alias IP ranges for this network interface. You can only specify this field for network interfaces in VPC networks.
    { # An alias IP range attached to an instance&#x27;s network interface.
      &quot;ipCidrRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. This IP CIDR range must belong to the specified subnetwork and cannot contain IP addresses reserved by system or used by other network interfaces. This range may be a single IP address (such as 10.2.3.4), a netmask (such as /24) or a CIDR-formatted string (such as 10.1.2.0/24).
      &quot;subnetworkRangeName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of a subnetwork secondary IP range from which to allocate an IP alias range. If not specified, the primary range of the subnetwork is used.
    },
  ],
  &quot;fingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Fingerprint hash of contents stored in this network interface. This field will be ignored when inserting an Instance or adding a NetworkInterface. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the NetworkInterface, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.
  &quot;ipv6Address&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] An IPv6 internal network address for this network interface.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#networkInterface&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#networkInterface for network interfaces.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The name of the network interface, which is generated by the server. For network devices, these are eth0, eth1, etc.
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # URL of the network resource for this instance. When creating an instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified, the default network global/networks/default is used; if the network is not specified but the subnetwork is specified, the network is inferred.
      # 
      # If you specify this property, you can specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:
      # - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/networks/network
      # - projects/project/global/networks/network
      # - global/networks/default
  &quot;networkIP&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An IPv4 internal IP address to assign to the instance for this network interface. If not specified by the user, an unused internal IP is assigned by the system.

  &quot;subnetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance. If the network resource is in legacy mode, do not specify this field. If the network is in auto subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is optional. If the network is in custom subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is required. If you specify this field, you can specify the subnetwork as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all valid URLs:
      # - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork
      # - regions/region/subnetworks/subnetwork
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    # * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations)
    #
    # You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses.
    #
    # Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
    # - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource.
    # - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource.
    # - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource.
    #
    # For more information, read  Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources. (== resource_for {$api_version}.globalOperations ==) (== resource_for {$api_version}.regionOperations ==) (== resource_for {$api_version}.zoneOperations ==)
  &quot;clientOperationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The value of `requestId` if you provided it in the request. Not present otherwise.
  &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Deprecated] This field is deprecated.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A textual description of the operation, which is set when the operation is created.
  &quot;endTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The time that this operation was completed. This value is in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # [Output Only] If errors are generated during processing of the operation, this field will be populated.
    &quot;errors&quot;: [ # [Output Only] The array of errors encountered while processing this operation.
      {
        &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The error type identifier for this error.
        &quot;location&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Indicates the field in the request that caused the error. This property is optional.
        &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] An optional, human-readable error message.
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;httpErrorMessage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error message that was returned, such as `NOT FOUND`.
  &quot;httpErrorStatusCode&quot;: 42, # [Output Only] If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error status code that was returned. For example, a `404` means the resource was not found.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the operation. This identifier is defined by the server.
  &quot;insertTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The time that this operation was requested. This value is in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#operation&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always `compute#operation` for Operation resources.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Name of the operation.
  &quot;operationType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The type of operation, such as `insert`, `update`, or `delete`, and so on.
  &quot;progress&quot;: 42, # [Output Only] An optional progress indicator that ranges from 0 to 100. There is no requirement that this be linear or support any granularity of operations. This should not be used to guess when the operation will be complete. This number should monotonically increase as the operation progresses.
  &quot;region&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the region where the operation resides. Only applicable when performing regional operations.
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
  &quot;startTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The time that this operation was started by the server. This value is in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The status of the operation, which can be one of the following: `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, or `DONE`.
  &quot;statusMessage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] An optional textual description of the current status of the operation.
  &quot;targetId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The unique target ID, which identifies a specific incarnation of the target resource.
  &quot;targetLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the resource that the operation modifies. For operations related to creating a snapshot, this points to the persistent disk that the snapshot was created from.
  &quot;user&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] User who requested the operation, for example: `user@example.com`.
  &quot;warnings&quot;: [ # [Output Only] If warning messages are generated during processing of the operation, this field will be populated.
    {
      &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A warning code, if applicable. For example, Compute Engine returns NO_RESULTS_ON_PAGE if there are no results in the response.
      &quot;data&quot;: [ # [Output Only] Metadata about this warning in key: value format. For example:
          # &quot;data&quot;: [ { &quot;key&quot;: &quot;scope&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;zones/us-east1-d&quot; }
        {
          &quot;key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding).
          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A warning data value corresponding to the key.
        },
      ],
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A human-readable description of the warning code.
    },
  ],
  &quot;zone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the zone where the operation resides. Only applicable when performing per-zone operations.
