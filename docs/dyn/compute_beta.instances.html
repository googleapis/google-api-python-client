<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addAccessConfig">addAccessConfig(project, zone, instance, networkInterface, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds an access config to an instance&#x27;s network interface.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, The instance name for this request. (required)
  networkInterface: string, The name of the network interface to add to this instance. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An access configuration attached to an instance&#x27;s network interface. Only one access config per instance is supported.
  &quot;externalIpv6&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The first IPv6 address of the external IPv6 range associated with this instance, prefix length is stored in externalIpv6PrefixLength in ipv6AccessConfig. To use a static external IP address, it must be unused and in the same region as the instance&#x27;s zone. If not specified, GCP will automatically assign an external IPv6 address from the instance&#x27;s subnetwork.
  &quot;externalIpv6PrefixLength&quot;: 42, # The prefix length of the external IPv6 range.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#accessConfig&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#accessConfig for access configs.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of this access configuration. The default and recommended name is External NAT, but you can use any arbitrary string, such as My external IP or Network Access.
  &quot;natIP&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An external IP address associated with this instance. Specify an unused static external IP address available to the project or leave this field undefined to use an IP from a shared ephemeral IP address pool. If you specify a static external IP address, it must live in the same region as the zone of the instance.
  &quot;networkTier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this access configuration and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD. If an AccessConfig is specified without a valid external IP address, an ephemeral IP will be created with this networkTier. If an AccessConfig with a valid external IP address is specified, it must match that of the networkTier associated with the Address resource owning that IP.
  &quot;publicPtrDomainName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The DNS domain name for the public PTR record. You can set this field only if the `setPublicPtr` field is enabled in accessConfig. If this field is unspecified in ipv6AccessConfig, a default PTR record will be createc for first IP in associated external IPv6 range.
  &quot;setPublicPtr&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether a public DNS &#x27;PTR&#x27; record should be created to map the external IP address of the instance to a DNS domain name. This field is not used in ipv6AccessConfig. A default PTR record will be created if the VM has external IPv6 range associated.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ONE_TO_ONE_NAT&quot;, # The type of configuration. The default and only option is ONE_TO_ONE_NAT.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
  &quot;clientOperationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The value of `requestId` if you provided it in the request. Not present otherwise.
  &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Deprecated] This field is deprecated.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A textual description of the operation, which is set when the operation is created.
  &quot;endTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The time that this operation was completed. This value is in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # [Output Only] If errors are generated during processing of the operation, this field will be populated.
    &quot;errors&quot;: [ # [Output Only] The array of errors encountered while processing this operation.
      {
        &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The error type identifier for this error.
        &quot;errorDetails&quot;: [ # [Output Only] An optional list of messages that contain the error details. There is a set of defined message types to use for providing details.The syntax depends on the error code. For example, QuotaExceededInfo will have details when the error code is QUOTA_EXCEEDED.

When identifying the current value of an exceeded limit, the units should be contained in the key, not the value. For example, rather than {&quot;instanceLimit&quot;: &quot;100/request&quot;}, should be returned as, {&quot;instanceLimitPerRequest&quot;: &quot;100&quot;}, if the client exceeds the number of instances that can be created in a single (batch) request.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addResourcePolicies">addResourcePolicies(project, zone, instance, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds existing resource policies to an instance. You can only add one policy right now which will be applied to this instance for scheduling live migrations.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, The instance name for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;resourcePolicies&quot;: [ # Resource policies to be added to this instance.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, filter=None, includeAllScopes=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves an aggregated list of all of the instances in your project across all regions and zones. The performance of this method degrades when a filter is specified on a project that has a very large number of instances.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  includeAllScopes: boolean, Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

This name can be used to reference the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance. If not specified, the server chooses a default device name to apply to this disk, in the form persistent-disk-x, where x is a number assigned by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.

This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="deleteAccessConfig">deleteAccessConfig(project, zone, instance, accessConfig, networkInterface, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes an access config from an instance&#x27;s network interface.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, The instance name for this request. (required)
  accessConfig: string, The name of the access config to delete. (required)
  networkInterface: string, The name of the network interface. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance for this request. (required)
  port: integer, Specifies which COM or serial port to retrieve data from.
  start: string, Specifies the starting byte position of the output to return. To start with the first byte of output to the specified port, omit this field or set it to `0`. If the output for that byte position is available, this field matches the `start` parameter sent with the request. If the amount of serial console output exceeds the size of the buffer (1 MB), the oldest output is discarded and is no longer available. If the requested start position refers to discarded output, the start position is adjusted to the oldest output still available, and the adjusted start position is returned as the `start` property value. You can also provide a negative start position, which translates to the most recent number of bytes written to the serial port. For example, -3 is interpreted as the most recent 3 bytes written to the serial console.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of instances contained within the specified zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

    <code class="details" id="listReferrers">listReferrers(project, zone, instance, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of resources that refer to the VM instance specified in the request. For example, if the VM instance is part of a managed or unmanaged instance group, the referrers list includes the instance group. For more information, read Viewing referrers to VM instances.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the target instance scoping this request, or &#x27;-&#x27; if the request should span over all instances in the container. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  },
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  <pre>Sets deletion protection on the instance.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  resource: string, Name or id of the resource for this request. (required)
  deletionProtection: boolean, Whether the resource should be protected against deletion.
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  <pre>Changes the machine type for a stopped instance to the machine type specified in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance scoping this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  <pre>Changes the minimum CPU platform that this instance should use. This method can only be called on a stopped instance. For more information, read Specifying a Minimum CPU Platform.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance scoping this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;minCpuPlatform&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Minimum cpu/platform this instance should be started at.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="setShieldedInstanceIntegrityPolicy">setShieldedInstanceIntegrityPolicy(project, zone, instance, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the Shielded Instance integrity policy for an instance. You can only use this method on a running instance. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name or id of the instance scoping this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The policy describes the baseline against which Instance boot integrity is measured.
  &quot;updateAutoLearnPolicy&quot;: True or False, # Updates the integrity policy baseline using the measurements from the VM instance&#x27;s most recent boot.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setTags">setTags(project, zone, instance, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets network tags for the specified instance to the data included in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance scoping this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A set of instance tags.
  &quot;fingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a hash of the tags&#x27; contents and used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update tags. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change tags. To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.
  &quot;items&quot;: [ # An array of tags. Each tag must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    <code class="details" id="start">start(project, zone, instance, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts an instance that was stopped using the instances().stop method. For more information, see Restart an instance.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance resource to start. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="stop">stop(project, zone, instance, discardLocalSsd=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Stops a running instance, shutting it down cleanly, and allows you to restart the instance at a later time. Stopped instances do not incur VM usage charges while they are stopped. However, resources that the VM is using, such as persistent disks and static IP addresses, will continue to be charged until they are deleted. For more information, see Stopping an instance.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance resource to stop. (required)
  discardLocalSsd: boolean, If true, discard the contents of any attached localSSD partitions. Default value is false.
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="updateAccessConfig">updateAccessConfig(project, zone, instance, networkInterface, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the specified access config from an instance&#x27;s network interface with the data included in the request. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, The instance name for this request. (required)
  networkInterface: string, The name of the network interface where the access config is attached. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An access configuration attached to an instance&#x27;s network interface. Only one access config per instance is supported.
  &quot;externalIpv6&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The first IPv6 address of the external IPv6 range associated with this instance, prefix length is stored in externalIpv6PrefixLength in ipv6AccessConfig. To use a static external IP address, it must be unused and in the same region as the instance&#x27;s zone. If not specified, GCP will automatically assign an external IPv6 address from the instance&#x27;s subnetwork.
  &quot;externalIpv6PrefixLength&quot;: 42, # The prefix length of the external IPv6 range.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#accessConfig&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#accessConfig for access configs.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of this access configuration. The default and recommended name is External NAT, but you can use any arbitrary string, such as My external IP or Network Access.
  &quot;natIP&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An external IP address associated with this instance. Specify an unused static external IP address available to the project or leave this field undefined to use an IP from a shared ephemeral IP address pool. If you specify a static external IP address, it must live in the same region as the zone of the instance.
  &quot;networkTier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this access configuration and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD. If an AccessConfig is specified without a valid external IP address, an ephemeral IP will be created with this networkTier. If an AccessConfig with a valid external IP address is specified, it must match that of the networkTier associated with the Address resource owning that IP.
  &quot;publicPtrDomainName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The DNS domain name for the public PTR record. You can set this field only if the `setPublicPtr` field is enabled in accessConfig. If this field is unspecified in ipv6AccessConfig, a default PTR record will be createc for first IP in associated external IPv6 range.
  &quot;setPublicPtr&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether a public DNS &#x27;PTR&#x27; record should be created to map the external IP address of the instance to a DNS domain name. This field is not used in ipv6AccessConfig. A default PTR record will be created if the VM has external IPv6 range associated.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ONE_TO_ONE_NAT&quot;, # The type of configuration. The default and only option is ONE_TO_ONE_NAT.
}

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="updateDisplayDevice">updateDisplayDevice(project, zone, instance, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the Display config for a VM instance. You can only use this method on a stopped VM instance. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name of the instance scoping this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A set of Display Device options
  &quot;enableDisplay&quot;: True or False, # Defines whether the instance has Display enabled.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

  <pre>Updates the Shielded Instance config for an instance. You can only use this method on a stopped instance. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  instance: string, Name or id of the instance scoping this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A set of Shielded Instance options.
  &quot;enableIntegrityMonitoring&quot;: True or False, # Defines whether the instance has integrity monitoring enabled. Enabled by default.
  &quot;enableSecureBoot&quot;: True or False, # Defines whether the instance has Secure Boot enabled. Disabled by default.
  &quot;enableVtpm&quot;: True or False, # Defines whether the instance has the vTPM enabled. Enabled by default.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
