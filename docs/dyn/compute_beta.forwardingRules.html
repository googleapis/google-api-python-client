  <pre>Retrieves an aggregated list of forwarding rules.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  includeAllScopes: boolean, Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the logic is the same as today.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

              #
              # - vpc-sc - GCP APIs that support VPC Service Controls. For more information about which APIs support VPC Service Controls, refer to VPC-SC supported products and limitations.
              # - all-apis - All GCP APIs. For more information about which APIs are supported with this bundle, refer to Private Google Access-specific domains and VIPs.

  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  forwardingRule: string, Name of the ForwardingRule resource to delete. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  <pre>Retrieves a list of ForwardingRule resources available to the specified project and region.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the logic is the same as today.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

    { # Represents an Operation resource.
    #
    # Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources:
    #
    # * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations)
    #
    # You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses.
    #
    # Operations can be global, regional or zonal.
    # - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource.
    # - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource.
    # - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource.
    #
    # For more information, read  Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources. (== resource_for {$api_version}.globalOperations ==) (== resource_for {$api_version}.regionOperations ==) (== resource_for {$api_version}.zoneOperations ==)
  &quot;clientOperationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The value of `requestId` if you provided it in the request. Not present otherwise.
  &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Deprecated] This field is deprecated.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A textual description of the operation, which is set when the operation is created.
  &quot;endTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The time that this operation was completed. This value is in RFC3339 text format.

        &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] An optional, human-readable error message.
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;httpErrorMessage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error message that was returned, such as `NOT FOUND`.
  &quot;httpErrorStatusCode&quot;: 42, # [Output Only] If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error status code that was returned. For example, a `404` means the resource was not found.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the operation. This identifier is defined by the server.
  &quot;insertTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The time that this operation was requested. This value is in RFC3339 text format.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Name of the operation.
  &quot;operationType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The type of operation, such as `insert`, `update`, or `delete`, and so on.
  &quot;progress&quot;: 42, # [Output Only] An optional progress indicator that ranges from 0 to 100. There is no requirement that this be linear or support any granularity of operations. This should not be used to guess when the operation will be complete. This number should monotonically increase as the operation progresses.
  &quot;region&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the region where the operation resides. Only applicable when performing regional operations.
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

    {
      &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A warning code, if applicable. For example, Compute Engine returns NO_RESULTS_ON_PAGE if there are no results in the response.
      &quot;data&quot;: [ # [Output Only] Metadata about this warning in key: value format. For example:
          # &quot;data&quot;: [ { &quot;key&quot;: &quot;scope&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;zones/us-east1-d&quot; }
        {
          &quot;key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding).
          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A warning data value corresponding to the key.
        },
