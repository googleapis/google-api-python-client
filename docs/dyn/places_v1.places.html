  <pre>Get place details with a place id (in a name) string.

Args:
  name: string, Required. A place ID returned in a Place (with &quot;places/&quot; prefix), or equivalently the name in the same Place. Format: `places/{place_id}`. (required)
  languageCode: string, Optional. Place details will be displayed with the preferred language if available. Current list of supported languages: https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport.
  regionCode: string, Optional. The Unicode country/region code (CLDR) of the location where the request is coming from. This parameter is used to display the place details, like region-specific place name, if available. The parameter can affect results based on applicable law. For more information, see https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/territory_language_information.html. Note that 3-digit region codes are not currently supported.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # All the information representing a Place.
  &quot;accessibilityOptions&quot;: { # Information about the accessibility options a place offers. # Information about the accessibility options a place offers.
    &quot;wheelchairAccessibleEntrance&quot;: True or False, # Places has wheelchair accessible entrance.

To retrieve all the political entities that contain a specific address, you should use reverse geocoding, passing the latitude/longitude of the address as a parameter to the request. - The format of the response is not guaranteed to remain the same between requests. In particular, the number of address_components varies based on the address requested and can change over time for the same address. A component can change position in the array. The type of the component can change. A particular component may be missing in a later response.
