<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Schedules in a Location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the Location to list the Schedules from. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  filter: string, Lists the Schedules that match the filter expression. The following fields are supported: * `display_name`: Supports `=`, `!=` comparisons, and `:` wildcard. * `state`: Supports `=` and `!=` comparisons. * `request`: Supports existence of the check. (e.g. `create_pipeline_job_request:*` --&gt; Schedule has create_pipeline_job_request). * `create_time`: Supports `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, and `&gt;=` comparisons. Values must be in RFC 3339 format. * `start_time`: Supports `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, and `&gt;=` comparisons. Values must be in RFC 3339 format. * `end_time`: Supports `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` comparisons and `:*` existence check. Values must be in RFC 3339 format. * `next_run_time`: Supports `=`, `!=`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;=`, and `&gt;=` comparisons. Values must be in RFC 3339 format. Filter expressions can be combined together using logical operators (`NOT`, `AND` &amp; `OR`). The syntax to define filter expression is based on https://google.aip.dev/160. Examples: * `state=&quot;ACTIVE&quot; AND display_name:&quot;my_schedule_*&quot;` * `NOT display_name=&quot;my_schedule&quot;` * `create_time&gt;&quot;2021-05-18T00:00:00Z&quot;` * `end_time&gt;&quot;2021-05-18T00:00:00Z&quot; OR NOT end_time:*` * `create_pipeline_job_request:*`
  orderBy: string, A comma-separated list of fields to order by. The default sort order is in ascending order. Use &quot;desc&quot; after a field name for descending. You can have multiple order_by fields provided. For example, using &quot;create_time desc, end_time&quot; will order results by create time in descending order, and if there are multiple schedules having the same create time, order them by the end time in ascending order. If order_by is not specified, it will order by default with create_time in descending order. Supported fields: * `create_time` * `start_time` * `end_time` * `next_run_time`
  pageSize: integer, The standard list page size. Default to 100 if not specified.
  pageToken: string, The standard list page token. Typically obtained via ListSchedulesResponse.next_page_token of the previous ScheduleService.ListSchedules call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Use this field when all features are normalized to have the same distribution: scale to range [0, 1], [-1, 1] or z-scoring, where features are normalized to have 0-mean and 1-variance. Learn more about [normalization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/transform/normalization). For best results the recommended value is about 10% - 20% of the standard deviation of the input feature. Refer to section 3.2 of the SmoothGrad paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf. Defaults to 0.1. If the distribution is different per feature, set feature_noise_sigma instead for each feature.

  <pre>Pauses a Schedule. Will mark Schedule.state to &#x27;PAUSED&#x27;. If the schedule is paused, no new runs will be created. Already created runs will NOT be paused or canceled.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the Schedule resource to be paused. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/schedules/{schedule}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

  <pre>Resumes a paused Schedule to start scheduling new runs. Will mark Schedule.state to &#x27;ACTIVE&#x27;. Only paused Schedule can be resumed. When the Schedule is resumed, new runs will be scheduled starting from the next execution time after the current time based on the time_specification in the Schedule.

}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
