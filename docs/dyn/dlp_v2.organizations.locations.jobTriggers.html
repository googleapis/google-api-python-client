Likelihood may never drop below `VERY_UNLIKELY` or exceed `VERY_LIKELY`, so applying an adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is `VERY_LIKELY` will result in a final likelihood of `LIKELY`.

Additionally, the characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits.

This can be used to match sensitive information specific to the data, such as a list of employee IDs or job titles. Dictionary words are case-insensitive and all characters other than letters and digits in the unicode [Basic Multilingual Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane) will be replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the dictionary phrase &quot;Sam Johnson&quot; will match all three phrases &quot;sam johnson&quot;, &quot;Sam, Johnson&quot;, and &quot;Sam (Johnson)&quot;. Additionally, the characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary word &quot;jen&quot; will match the first three letters of the text &quot;jen123&quot; but will return no matches for &quot;jennifer&quot;. Dictionary words containing a large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in unexpected findings because such characters are treated as whitespace.

  <pre>Lists job triggers. See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-job-triggers to learn more.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. The format of this value varies depending on whether you have [specified a processing location](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/specifying-location): + Projects scope, location specified: `projects/`PROJECT_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID + Projects scope, no location specified (defaults to global): `projects/`PROJECT_ID The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  filter: string, Allows filtering. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * Supported fields/values for inspect triggers: - `status` - HEALTHY|PAUSED|CANCELLED - `inspected_storage` - DATASTORE|CLOUD_STORAGE|BIGQUERY - &#x27;last_run_time` - RFC 3339 formatted timestamp, surrounded by quotation marks. Nanoseconds are ignored. - &#x27;error_count&#x27; - Number of errors that have occurred while running. * The operator must be `=` or `!=` for status and inspected_storage. Examples: * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND status = HEALTHY * inspected_storage = cloud_storage OR inspected_storage = bigquery * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND (state = PAUSED OR state = HEALTHY) * last_run_time &gt; \&quot;2017-12-12T00:00:00+00:00\&quot; The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
  locationId: string, Deprecated. This field has no effect.
  orderBy: string, Comma separated list of triggeredJob fields to order by, followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case-insensitive, default sorting order is ascending, redundant space characters are insignificant. Example: `name asc,update_time, create_time desc` Supported fields are: - `create_time`: corresponds to time the JobTrigger was created. - `update_time`: corresponds to time the JobTrigger was last updated. - `last_run_time`: corresponds to the last time the JobTrigger ran. - `name`: corresponds to JobTrigger&#x27;s name. - `display_name`: corresponds to JobTrigger&#x27;s display name. - `status`: corresponds to JobTrigger&#x27;s status.
  pageSize: integer, Size of the page, can be limited by a server.
  pageToken: string, Page token to continue retrieval. Comes from previous call to ListJobTriggers. `order_by` field must not change for subsequent calls.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Included files are those that match at least one item in `include_regex` and do not match any items in `exclude_regex`. Note that a file that matches items from both lists will _not_ be included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular expression. For example, given the input `{bucket_name: &quot;mybucket&quot;, include_regex: [&quot;directory1/.*&quot;], exclude_regex: [&quot;directory1/excluded.*&quot;]}`: * `gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile` will be included * `gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile` will be included (`.*` matches across `/`) * `gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile` will _not_ be included (the full path doesn&#x27;t match any items in `include_regex`) * `gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile` will _not_ be included (the path matches an item in `exclude_regex`) If `include_regex` is left empty, it will match all files by default (this is equivalent to setting `include_regex: [&quot;.*&quot;]`). Some other common use cases: * `{bucket_name: &quot;mybucket&quot;, exclude_regex: [&quot;.*\.pdf&quot;]}` will include all files in `mybucket` except for .pdf files * `{bucket_name: &quot;mybucket&quot;, include_regex: [&quot;directory/[^/]+&quot;]}` will include all files directly under `gs://mybucket/directory/`, without matching across `/` # The regex-filtered set of files to scan. Exactly one of `url` or `regex_file_set` must be set.
