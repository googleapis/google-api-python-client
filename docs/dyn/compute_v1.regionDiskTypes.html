  <pre>Returns the specified regional disk type. Gets a list of available disk types by making a list() request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, The name of the region for this request. (required)

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  },
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] An optional description of this resource.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, region, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of regional disk types available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, The name of the region for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

Returns:
  An object of the form:
