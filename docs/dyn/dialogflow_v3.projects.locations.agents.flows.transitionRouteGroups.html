  <pre>Creates an TransitionRouteGroup in the specified flow.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The flow to create an TransitionRouteGroup for. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An TransitionRouteGroup represents a group of `TransitionRoutes` to be used by a Page.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human-readable name of the transition route group, unique within the Agent. The display name can be no longer than 30 characters.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique identifier of the transition route group. TransitionRouteGroups.CreateTransitionRouteGroup populates the name automatically. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows//transitionRouteGroups/`.
  &quot;transitionRoutes&quot;: [ # Transition routes associated with the TransitionRouteGroup.
    { # A transition route specifies a intent that can be matched and/or a data condition that can be evaluated during a session. When a specified transition is matched, the following actions are taken in order: * If there is a `trigger_fulfillment` associated with the transition, it will be called. * If there is a `target_page` associated with the transition, the session will transition into the specified page. * If there is a `target_flow` associated with the transition, the session will transition into the specified flow.
      &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The condition to evaluate against form parameters or session parameters. See the [conditions reference](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/condition). At least one of `intent` or `condition` must be specified. When both `intent` and `condition` are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.
      &quot;intent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique identifier of an Intent. Format: `projects//locations//agents//intents/`. Indicates that the transition can only happen when the given intent is matched. At least one of `intent` or `condition` must be specified. When both `intent` and `condition` are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of this transition route.
      &quot;targetFlow&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The target flow to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows/`.
      &quot;targetPage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The target page to transition to. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows//pages/`.
      &quot;triggerFulfillment&quot;: { # A fulfillment can do one or more of the following actions at the same time: * Generate rich message responses. * Set parameter values. * Call the webhook. Fulfillments can be called at various stages in the Page or Form lifecycle. For example, when a DetectIntentRequest drives a session to enter a new page, the page&#x27;s entry fulfillment can add a static response to the QueryResult in the returning DetectIntentResponse, call the webhook (for example, to load user data from a database), or both. # The fulfillment to call when the condition is satisfied. At least one of `trigger_fulfillment` and `target` must be specified. When both are defined, `trigger_fulfillment` is executed first.

The agent designer should ideally use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. * Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The flow to list all transition route groups for. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows/`. (required)
  languageCode: string, The language to list transition route groups for. The field `messages` in TransitionRoute is language dependent. If not specified, the agent&#x27;s default language is used.

  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of items to return in a single page. By default 100 and at most 1000.
  pageToken: string, The next_page_token value returned from a previous list request.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
