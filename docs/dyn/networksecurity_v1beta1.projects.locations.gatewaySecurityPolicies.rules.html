  &quot;enabled&quot;: True or False, # Required. Whether the rule is enforced.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. Name of the resource. ame is the full resource name so projects/{project}/locations/{location}/gatewaySecurityPolicies/{gateway_security_policy}/rules/{rule} rule should match the pattern: (^[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$).
  &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Required. Priority of the rule. Lower number corresponds to higher precedence.
  &quot;sessionMatcher&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CEL expression for matching on session criteria.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
