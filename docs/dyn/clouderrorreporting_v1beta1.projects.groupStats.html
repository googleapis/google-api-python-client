Args:
  projectName: string, Required. The resource name of the Google Cloud Platform project. Written as `projects/{projectID}` or `projects/{projectNumber}`, where `{projectID}` and `{projectNumber}` can be found in the [Google Cloud Console](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158840). Examples: `projects/my-project-123`, `projects/5551234`. (required)
  alignment: string, Optional. The alignment of the timed counts to be returned. Default is `ALIGNMENT_EQUAL_AT_END`.
    Allowed values
      ERROR_COUNT_ALIGNMENT_UNSPECIFIED - No alignment specified.
      ALIGNMENT_EQUAL_ROUNDED - The time periods shall be consecutive, have width equal to the requested duration, and be aligned at the `alignment_time` provided in the request. The `alignment_time` does not have to be inside the query period but even if it is outside, only time periods are returned which overlap with the query period. A rounded alignment will typically result in a different size of the first or the last time period.
      ALIGNMENT_EQUAL_AT_END - The time periods shall be consecutive, have width equal to the requested duration, and be aligned at the end of the requested time period. This can result in a different size of the first time period.
  alignmentTime: string, Optional. Time where the timed counts shall be aligned if rounded alignment is chosen. Default is 00:00 UTC.
  groupId: string, Optional. List all ErrorGroupStats with these IDs. (repeated)
  order: string, Optional. The sort order in which the results are returned. Default is `COUNT_DESC`.
    Allowed values
      GROUP_ORDER_UNSPECIFIED - No group order specified.
      COUNT_DESC - Total count of errors in the given time window in descending order.
      LAST_SEEN_DESC - Timestamp when the group was last seen in the given time window in descending order.
      CREATED_DESC - Timestamp when the group was created in descending order.
      AFFECTED_USERS_DESC - Number of affected users in the given time window in descending order.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of results to return per response. Default is 20.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A `next_page_token` provided by a previous response. To view additional results, pass this token along with the identical query parameters as the first request.
  serviceFilter_resourceType: string, Optional. The exact value to match against [`ServiceContext.resource_type`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/ServiceContext#FIELDS.resource_type).
  serviceFilter_service: string, Optional. The exact value to match against [`ServiceContext.service`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/ServiceContext#FIELDS.service).
  serviceFilter_version: string, Optional. The exact value to match against [`ServiceContext.version`](/error-reporting/reference/rest/v1beta1/ServiceContext#FIELDS.version).
  timeRange_period: string, Restricts the query to the specified time range.
    Allowed values
      PERIOD_UNSPECIFIED - Do not use.
      PERIOD_1_HOUR - Retrieve data for the last hour. Recommended minimum timed count duration: 1 min.
      PERIOD_6_HOURS - Retrieve data for the last 6 hours. Recommended minimum timed count duration: 10 min.
      PERIOD_1_DAY - Retrieve data for the last day. Recommended minimum timed count duration: 1 hour.
      PERIOD_1_WEEK - Retrieve data for the last week. Recommended minimum timed count duration: 6 hours.
      PERIOD_30_DAYS - Retrieve data for the last 30 days. Recommended minimum timed count duration: 1 day.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
