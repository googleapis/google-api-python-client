Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also would like to store the user&#x27;s timezone, that can be done in another field. This type is more flexible than some applications may want. Make sure to document and validate your application&#x27;s limitations. # Required. Start of the time interval for the given demand (inclusive). These values are read down to the minute; seconds and all smaller units are ignored.
          &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Optional. Day of month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 if specifying a datetime without a day.
          &quot;hours&quot;: 42, # Optional. Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23, defaults to 0 (midnight). An API may choose to allow the value &quot;24:00:00&quot; for scenarios like business closing time.

          &quot;seconds&quot;: 42, # Optional. Seconds of minutes of the time. Must normally be from 0 to 59, defaults to 0. An API may allow the value 60 if it allows leap-seconds.
          &quot;timeZone&quot;: { # Represents a time zone from the [IANA Time Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). # Time zone.
            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # IANA Time Zone Database time zone. For example &quot;America/New_York&quot;.
            &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. IANA Time Zone Database version number. For example &quot;2019a&quot;.
          },
          &quot;utcOffset&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # UTC offset. Must be whole seconds, between -18 hours and +18 hours. For example, a UTC offset of -4:00 would be represented as { seconds: -14400 }.

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
