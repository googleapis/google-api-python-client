  <pre>Use this method to describe the database entities tree for a specific conversion workspace and a specific tree type. The DB Entities are not a resource like conversion workspace or mapping rule, and they can not be created, updated or deleted like one. Instead they are simple data objects describing the structure of the client database.

Args:
  conversionWorkspace: string, Required. Name of the conversion workspace resource whose DB entities are described in the form of: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/conversionWorkspaces/{conversion_workspace}. (required)
  commitId: string, Request a specific commit id. If not specified, the entities from the latest commit are returned.
  filter: string, Filter the returned entities based on AIP-160 standard.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of entities to return. The service may return fewer than this value.
  pageToken: string, The nextPageToken value received in the previous call to conversionWorkspace.describeDatabaseEntities, used in the subsequent request to retrieve the next page of results. On first call this should be left blank. When paginating, all other parameters provided to conversionWorkspace.describeDatabaseEntities must match the call that provided the page token.
  tree: string, The tree to fetch.
    Allowed values
      DB_TREE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED - Unspecified tree type
      SOURCE_TREE - The source database tree
      DRAFT_TREE - The draft database tree
      DESTINATION_TREE - The destination database tree
  uncommitted: boolean, Whether to retrieve the latest committed version of the entities or the latest version. This field is ignored if a specific commit_id is specified.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.
