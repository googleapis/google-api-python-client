  <pre>Create a Service Perimeter. The longrunning operation from this RPC will have a successful status once the Service Perimeter has propagated to long-lasting storage. Service Perimeters containing errors will result in an error response for the first error encountered.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Resource name for the access policy which owns this Service Perimeter. Format: `accessPolicies/{policy_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # `ServicePerimeter` describes a set of Google Cloud resources which can freely import and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the `ServicePerimeter`. If a request with a source within this `ServicePerimeter` has a target outside of the `ServicePerimeter`, the request will be blocked. Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single Google Cloud project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service Perimeter Bridges can contain only Google Cloud projects as members, a single Google Cloud project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Description of the `ServicePerimeter` and its use. Does not affect behavior.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name for the `ServicePerimeter`. Format: `accessPolicies/{access_policy}/servicePerimeters/{service_perimeter}`. The `service_perimeter` component must begin with a letter, followed by alphanumeric characters or `_`. After you create a `ServicePerimeter`, you cannot change its `name`.
  &quot;perimeterType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Perimeter type indicator. A single project is allowed to be a member of single regular perimeter, but multiple service perimeter bridges.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
