<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists glossaries in a project. Returns NOT_FOUND, if the project doesn&#x27;t exist.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project from which to list all of the glossaries. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Filter specifying constraints of a list operation. Specify the constraint by the format of &quot;key=value&quot;, where key must be &quot;src&quot; or &quot;tgt&quot;, and the value must be a valid language code. For multiple restrictions, concatenate them by &quot;AND&quot; (uppercase only), such as: &quot;src=en-US AND tgt=zh-CN&quot;. Notice that the exact match is used here, which means using &#x27;en-US&#x27; and &#x27;en&#x27; can lead to different results, which depends on the language code you used when you create the glossary. For the unidirectional glossaries, the &quot;src&quot; and &quot;tgt&quot; add restrictions on the source and target language code separately. For the equivalent term set glossaries, the &quot;src&quot; and/or &quot;tgt&quot; add restrictions on the term set. For example: &quot;src=en-US AND tgt=zh-CN&quot; will only pick the unidirectional glossaries which exactly match the source language code as &quot;en-US&quot; and the target language code &quot;zh-CN&quot;, but all equivalent term set glossaries which contain &quot;en-US&quot; and &quot;zh-CN&quot; in their language set will be picked. If missing, no filtering is performed.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. Requested page size. The server may return fewer glossaries than requested. If unspecified, the server picks an appropriate default.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A token identifying a page of results the server should return. Typically, this is the value of [ListGlossariesResponse.next_page_token] returned from the previous call to `ListGlossaries` method. The first page is returned if `page_token`is empty or missing.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
