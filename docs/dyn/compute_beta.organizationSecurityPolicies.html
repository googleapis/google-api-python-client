<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addAssociation">addAssociation(securityPolicy, body=None, replaceExistingAssociation=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Inserts an association for the specified security policy.

Args:
  securityPolicy: string, Name of the security policy to update. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;attachmentId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource that the security policy is attached to.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The display name of the security policy of the association.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name for an association.
  &quot;securityPolicyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The security policy ID of the association.
}

  replaceExistingAssociation: boolean, Indicates whether or not to replace it if an association of the attachment already exists. This is false by default, in which case an error will be returned if an association already exists.
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="copyRules">copyRules(securityPolicy, requestId=None, sourceSecurityPolicy=None)</code>
  <pre>Copies rules to the specified security policy.

Args:
  securityPolicy: string, Name of the security policy to update. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  sourceSecurityPolicy: string, The security policy from which to copy rules.

  parentId: string, Parent ID for this request. The ID can be either be &quot;folders/[FOLDER_ID]&quot; if the parent is a folder or &quot;organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]&quot; if the parent is an organization.
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, parentId=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>List all the policies that have been configured for the specified project.

Args:
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  parentId: string, Parent ID for this request.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:

  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="move">move(securityPolicy, parentId=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Moves the specified security policy.

Args:
  securityPolicy: string, Name of the security policy to update. (required)
  parentId: string, The new parent of the security policy.
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.
