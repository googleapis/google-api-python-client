  <pre>Creates a backup schedule on a database. At most two backup schedules can be configured on a database, one daily backup schedule and one weekly backup schedule.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent database. Format `projects/{project}/databases/{database}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A backup schedule for a Cloud Firestore Database. This resource is owned by the database it is backing up, and is deleted along with the database. The actual backups are not though.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp at which this backup schedule was created and effective since. No backups will be created for this schedule before this time.
  &quot;dailyRecurrence&quot;: { # Represents a recurring schedule that runs every day. The time zone is UTC. # For a schedule that runs daily.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique backup schedule identifier across all locations and databases for the given project. This will be auto-assigned. Format is `projects/{project}/databases/{database}/backupSchedules/{backup_schedule}`
  &quot;retention&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # At what relative time in the future, compared to its creation time, the backup should be deleted, e.g. keep backups for 7 days. The maximum supported retention period is 14 weeks.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp at which this backup schedule was most recently updated. When a backup schedule is first created, this is the same as create_time.
  &quot;weeklyRecurrence&quot;: { # Represents a recurring schedule that runs on a specified day of the week. The time zone is UTC. # For a schedule that runs weekly on a specific day.
    &quot;day&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The day of week to run. DAY_OF_WEEK_UNSPECIFIED is not allowed.
  },
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
