  <pre>Retrieves a list of all statements from a given source that match the
specified target and statement string.

The API guarantees that all statements with secure source assets, such as
HTTPS websites or Android apps, have been made in a secure way by the owner
of those assets, as described in the [Digital Asset Links technical design
specification](https://github.com/google/digitalassetlinks/blob/master/well-known/details.md).
Specifically, you should consider that for insecure websites (that is,
where the URL starts with `http://` instead of `https://`), this guarantee
cannot be made.

The `List` command is most useful in cases where the API client wants to
know all the ways in which two assets are related, or enumerate all the
relationships from a particular source asset.  Example: a feature that
helps users navigate to related items.  When a mobile app is running on a
device, the feature would make it easy to navigate to the corresponding web
site or Google+ profile.

Args:
  source_web_site: string, Web assets are identified by a URL that contains only the scheme, hostname
and port parts.  The format is

    http[s]://&lt;hostname&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]

Hostnames must be fully qualified: they must end in a single period
(&quot;`.`&quot;).

Only the schemes &quot;http&quot; and &quot;https&quot; are currently allowed.

Port numbers are given as a decimal number, and they must be omitted if the
standard port numbers are used: 80 for http and 443 for https.

We call this limited URL the &quot;site&quot;.  All URLs that share the same scheme,
hostname and port are considered to be a part of the site and thus belong
to the web asset.

Example: the asset with the site `https://www.google.com` contains all
these URLs:

  *   `https://www.google.com/`
  *   `https://www.google.com:443/`
  *   `https://www.google.com/foo`
  *   `https://www.google.com/foo?bar`
  *   `https://www.google.com/foo#bar`
  *   `https://user@password:www.google.com/`

But it does not contain these URLs:

  *   `http://www.google.com/`       (wrong scheme)
  *   `https://google.com/`          (hostname does not match)
  *   `https://www.google.com:444/`  (port does not match)
REQUIRED
  source_androidApp_packageName: string, Android App assets are naturally identified by their Java package name.
For example, the Google Maps app uses the package name
`com.google.android.apps.maps`.
REQUIRED
  source_androidApp_certificate_sha256Fingerprint: string, The uppercase SHA-265 fingerprint of the certificate.  From the PEM
 certificate, it can be acquired like this:

    $ keytool -printcert -file $CERTFILE | grep SHA256:
    SHA256: 14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83: \
        42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5

or like this:

    $ openssl x509 -in $CERTFILE -noout -fingerprint -sha256
    SHA256 Fingerprint=14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64: \
        16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:44:E5

In this example, the contents of this field would be `14:6D:E9:83:C5:73:
06:50:D8:EE:B9:95:2F:34:FC:64:16:A0:83:42:E6:1D:BE:A8:8A:04:96:B2:3F:CF:
44:E5`.

If these tools are not available to you, you can convert the PEM
certificate into the DER format, compute the SHA-256 hash of that string
and represent the result as a hexstring (that is, uppercase hexadecimal
representations of each octet, separated by colons).
  relation: string, Use only associations that match the specified relation.

See the [`Statement`](#Statement) message for a detailed definition of
relation strings.

For a query to match a statement, one of the following must be true:

*    both the query&#x27;s and the statement&#x27;s relation strings match exactly,
     or
*    the query&#x27;s relation string is empty or missing.

Example: A query with relation `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls`
matches an asset link with relation
`delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for the List call.
    &quot;errorCode&quot;: [ # Error codes that describe the result of the List operation.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
