This method blocks until a response is received from the payment processsor. If this method succeeds, the merchant is guaranteed to receive funds for the order after shipment. If the request fails, it can be retried or the order may be cancelled. This method cannot be called after the entire order is already shipped. A rejected error code is returned when the payment service provider has declined the charge. This indicates a problem between the PSP and either the merchant's or customer's account. Sometimes this error will be resolved by the customer. We recommend retrying these errors once per day or cancelling the order with reason `failedToCaptureFunds` if the items cannot be held.</p>

Note: We recommend calling the returnrefundlineitem method to refund in-store returns. We will issue the refund directly to the customer.

To calculate price paid by the customer for a single line item including the discount: For each promotion, subtract the `LineItems[].adjustments[].priceAdjustment.value` amount from the `LineItems[].Price.value`. 2. To calculate price paid by the customer for a single line item including the discount in case of multiple quantity: For each promotion, divide the `LineItems[].adjustments[].priceAdjustment.value` by the quantity of products then subtract the resulting value from the `LineItems[].Product.Price.value` for each quantity item. Only 1 promotion can be applied to an offerId in a given order. To refund an item which had a promotion applied to it, make sure to refund the amount after first subtracting the promotion discount from the item price. More details about the program are here.

To calculate price paid by the customer for a single line item including the discount in case of multiple quantity: For each promotion, divide the `LineItems[].adjustments[].priceAdjustment.value` by the quantity of products then subtract the resulting value from the `LineItems[].Product.Price.value` for each quantity item. Only 1 promotion can be applied to an offerId in a given order. To refund an item which had a promotion applied to it, make sure to refund the amount after first subtracting the promotion discount from the item price. More details about the program are here.

If a promotion is applied to more than 1 offerId, divide the discount value by the number of affected offers to determine how much discount to apply to each offerId. Examples: 1. To calculate price paid by the customer for a single line item including the discount: For each promotion, subtract the `LineItems[].adjustments[].priceAdjustment.value` amount from the `LineItems[].Price.value`. 2. To calculate price paid by the customer for a single line item including the discount in case of multiple quantity: For each promotion, divide the `LineItems[].adjustments[].priceAdjustment.value` by the quantity of products then subtract the resulting value from the `LineItems[].Product.Price.value` for each quantity item. Only 1 promotion can be applied to an offerId in a given order. To refund an item which had a promotion applied to it, make sure to refund the amount after first subtracting the promotion discount from the item price. More details about the program are here.

  <pre>Returns and refunds a line item. Note that this method can only be called on fully shipped orders. The Orderreturns API is the preferred way to handle returns after you receive a return from a customer. You can use Orderreturns.list or Orderreturns.get to search for the return, and then use Orderreturns.processreturn to issue the refund. If the return cannot be found, then we recommend using this API to issue a refund.

Args:
  merchantId: string, The ID of the account that manages the order. This cannot be a multi-client account. (required)
  orderId: string, The ID of the order. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
