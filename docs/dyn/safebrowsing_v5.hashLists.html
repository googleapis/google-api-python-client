<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchGet">batchGet(names=None, sizeConstraints_maxDatabaseEntries=None, sizeConstraints_maxUpdateEntries=None, version=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Get multiple hash lists at once. It is very common for a client to need to get multiple hash lists. Using this method is preferred over using the regular Get method multiple times. This is a standard batch Get method as defined by https://google.aip.dev/231 and the HTTP method is also GET.

Args:
  names: string, Required. The names of the particular hash lists. The list MAY be a threat list, or it may be the Global Cache. The names MUST NOT contain duplicates; if they did, the client will get an error. (repeated)
  sizeConstraints_maxDatabaseEntries: integer, Sets the maximum number of entries that the client is willing to have in the local database for the list. (The server MAY cause the client to store less than this number of entries.) If omitted or zero, no database size limit is set.
  sizeConstraints_maxUpdateEntries: integer, The maximum size in number of entries. The update will not contain more entries than this value, but it is possible that the update will contain fewer entries than this value. This MUST be at least 1024. If omitted or zero, no update size limit is set.
  version: string, The versions of the hash list that the client already has. If this is the first time the client is fetching the hash lists, the field should be left empty. Otherwise, the client should supply the versions previously received from the server. The client MUST NOT manipulate those bytes. The client need not send the versions in the same order as the corresponding list names. The client may send fewer or more versions in a request than there are names. However the client MUST NOT send multiple versions that correspond to the same name; if it did, the client will get an error. Historical note: in V4 of the API, this was called `states`; it is now renamed to `version` for clarity. (repeated)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  <pre>List hash lists. In the V5 API, Google will never remove a hash list that has ever been returned by this method. This enables clients to skip using this method and simply hard-code all hash lists they need. This is a standard List method as defined by https://google.aip.dev/132 and the HTTP method is GET.

Args:
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of hash lists to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, the server will choose a page size, which may be larger than the number of hash lists so that pagination is not necessary.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListHashLists` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.
