<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addSubnetwork">addSubnetwork(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>For service producers, provisions a new subnet in a peered service&#x27;s shared
VPC network in the requested region and with the requested size that&#x27;s
expressed as a CIDR range (number of leading bits of ipV4 network mask).
The method checks against the assigned allocated ranges to find a
non-conflicting IP address range. The method will reuse a subnet if
subsequent calls contain the same subnet name, region, and prefix length.
This method will make producer&#x27;s tenant project to be a shared VPC service
project as needed.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. A tenant project in the service producer organization, in the
following format: services/{service}/{collection-id}/{resource-id}.
{collection-id} is the cloud resource collection type that represents the
tenant project. Only `projects` are supported.
{resource-id} is the tenant project numeric id, such as
`123456`. {service} the name of the peering service, such as
`service-peering.example.com`. This service must already be
enabled in the service consumer&#x27;s project. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to create a subnetwork in a previously peered service network.
    &quot;consumerNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the service consumer&#x27;s VPC network. The network
        # must have an existing private connection that was provisioned through the
        # connections.create method. The name must be in the following format:
        # `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`, where {project}
        # is a project number, such as `12345`. {network} is the name of a
        # VPC network in the project.
    &quot;subnetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A name for the new subnet. For information about the naming
        # requirements, see [subnetwork](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/subnetworks)
        # in the Compute API documentation.
    &quot;region&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of a [region](/compute/docs/regions-zones)
        # for the subnet, such `europe-west1`.
    &quot;consumer&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A resource that represents the service consumer, such as
        # `projects/123456`. The project number can be different from the
        # value in the consumer network parameter. For example, the network might be
        # part of a Shared VPC network. In those cases, Service Networking validates
        # that this resource belongs to that Shared VPC.
    &quot;ipPrefixLength&quot;: 42, # Required. The prefix length of the subnet&#x27;s IP address range.  Use CIDR
        # range notation, such as `30` to provision a subnet with an
        # `x.x.x.x/30` CIDR range. The IP address range is drawn from a
        # pool of available ranges in the service consumer&#x27;s allocated range.
    &quot;subnetworkUsers&quot;: [ # A list of members that are granted the `compute.networkUser`
        # role on the subnet.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;privateIpv6GoogleAccess&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet.
        # For information about the access types that can be set using this field,
        # see [subnetwork](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/subnetworks)
        # in the Compute API documentation.
    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Description of the subnet.
    &quot;requestedAddress&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The starting address of a range. The address must be a valid
        # IPv4 address in the x.x.x.x format. This value combined with the IP prefix
        # range is the CIDR range for the subnet. The range must be within the
        # allocated range that is assigned to the private connection. If the CIDR
        # range isn&#x27;t available, the call fails.
