<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="acknowledge">acknowledge(subscription, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Acknowledges the messages associated with the `ack_ids` in the
`AcknowledgeRequest`. The Pub/Sub system can remove the relevant messages
from the subscription.

Acknowledging a message whose ack deadline has expired may succeed,
but such a message may be redelivered later. Acknowledging a message more
than once will not result in an error.

Args:
  subscription: string, The subscription whose message is being acknowledged. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the Acknowledge method.
    "ackIds": [ # The acknowledgment ID for the messages being acknowledged that was returned
        # by the Pub/Sub system in the `Pull` response. Must not be empty.
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a subscription to a given topic.
If the subscription already exists, returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
If the corresponding topic doesn't exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`.

If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random
name for this subscription on the same project as the topic. Note that
for REST API requests, you must specify a name.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the subscription. It must have the format
`"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}"`. `{subscription}` must
start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers
(`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`),
plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters
in length, and it must not start with `"goog"`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
