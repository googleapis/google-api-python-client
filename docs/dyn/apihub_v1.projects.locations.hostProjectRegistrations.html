  <pre>Create a host project registration. A Google cloud project can be registered as a host project if it is not attached as a runtime project to another host project. A project can be registered as a host project only once. Subsequent register calls for the same project will fail.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource for the host project. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Host project registration refers to the registration of a Google cloud project with Api Hub as a host project. This is the project where Api Hub is provisioned. It acts as the consumer project for the Api Hub instance provisioned. Multiple runtime projects can be attached to the host project and these attachments define the scope of Api Hub.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the host project registration was created.
  &quot;gcpProject&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. Google cloud project name in the format: &quot;projects/abc&quot; or &quot;projects/123&quot;. As input, project name with either project id or number are accepted. As output, this field will contain project number.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The name of the host project registration. Format: &quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/hostProjectRegistrations/{host_project_registration}&quot;.
}

  hostProjectRegistrationId: string, Required. The ID to use for the Host Project Registration, which will become the final component of the host project registration&#x27;s resource name. The ID must be the same as the Google cloud project specified in the host_project_registration.gcp_project field.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Host project registration refers to the registration of a Google cloud project with Api Hub as a host project. This is the project where Api Hub is provisioned. It acts as the consumer project for the Api Hub instance provisioned. Multiple runtime projects can be attached to the host project and these attachments define the scope of Api Hub.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the host project registration was created.
  &quot;gcpProject&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. Google cloud project name in the format: &quot;projects/abc&quot; or &quot;projects/123&quot;. As input, project name with either project id or number are accepted. As output, this field will contain project number.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The name of the host project registration. Format: &quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/hostProjectRegistrations/{host_project_registration}&quot;.
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Get a host project registration.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Host project registration resource name. projects/{project}/locations/{location}/hostProjectRegistrations/{host_project_registration_id} (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists host project registrations.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent, which owns this collection of host projects. Format: `projects/*/locations/*` (required)
  filter: string, Optional. An expression that filters the list of HostProjectRegistrations. A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string. All standard operators as documented at https://google.aip.dev/160 are supported. The following fields in the `HostProjectRegistration` are eligible for filtering: * `name` - The name of the HostProjectRegistration. * `create_time` - The time at which the HostProjectRegistration was created. The value should be in the (RFC3339)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339] format. * `gcp_project` - The Google cloud project associated with the HostProjectRegistration.
  orderBy: string, Optional. Hint for how to order the results.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of host project registrations to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 50 host project registrations will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListHostProjectRegistrations` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters (except page_size) provided to `ListHostProjectRegistrations` must match the call that provided the page token.
