<p class="firstline">Import messages to the HL7v2 store by loading data from the specified sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some HL7v2 store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty HL7v2 store that is not being used by other clients. An existing message will be overwritten if a duplicate message is imported. A duplicate message is a message with the same raw bytes as a message that already exists in this HL7v2 store. When a message is overwritten, its labels will also be overwritten. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid messages with the same raw bytes but different labels. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one message with those raw bytes but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the labels it has. The operation result counters do not count duplicated raw bytes as an error and count one success for each message in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of messages in the HL7v2 store. If some messages fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported messages are not rolled back. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

  <pre>Creates a new HL7v2 store within the parent dataset.

Args:
  parent: string, The name of the dataset this HL7v2 store belongs to. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents an HL7v2 store.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize HL7v2 stores. Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: \p{Ll}\p{Lo}{0,62} Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63} No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource name of the HL7v2 store, of the form `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/hl7V2Stores/{hl7v2_store_id}`.
  &quot;notificationConfig&quot;: { # Specifies where to send notifications upon changes to a data store. # The notification destination all messages (both Ingest &amp; Create) are published on. Only the message name is sent as part of the notification. If this is unset, no notifications are sent. Supplied by the client.
    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can&#x27;t be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren&#x27;t submitted. Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see [Configuring Pub/Sub notifications](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub) for specific details.
    &quot;sendForBulkImport&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether or not to send Pub/Sub notifications on bulk import. Only supported for DICOM imports.
  },
  &quot;notificationConfigs&quot;: [ # A list of notification configs. Each configuration uses a filter to determine whether to publish a message (both Ingest &amp; Create) on the corresponding notification destination. Only the message name is sent as part of the notification. Supplied by the client.
    { # Specifies where and whether to send notifications upon changes to a data store.
      &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Restricts notifications sent for messages matching a filter. If this is empty, all messages are matched. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `&quot;query text&quot;`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `&quot;Comment = great&quot;` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it&#x27;s just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Fields/functions available for filtering are: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = &quot;ADT&quot;`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset&#x27;s time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date &lt; &quot;2017-01-02&quot;`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time &lt; &quot;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time &lt; &quot;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = &quot;ABC&quot;`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId(&quot;123456&quot;, &quot;MRN&quot;)`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels.&quot;priority&quot;=&quot;high&quot;`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels.&quot;priority&quot;:*`.
      &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. The notification is a `PubsubMessage` with the following fields: * `PubsubMessage.Data` contains the resource name. * `PubsubMessage.MessageId` is the ID of this notification. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. * `PubsubMessage.PublishTime` is the time when the message was published. Note that notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic.

      &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Restricts notifications sent for messages matching a filter. If this is empty, all messages are matched. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `&quot;query text&quot;`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `&quot;Comment = great&quot;` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it&#x27;s just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Fields/functions available for filtering are: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = &quot;ADT&quot;`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset&#x27;s time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date &lt; &quot;2017-01-02&quot;`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time &lt; &quot;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time &lt; &quot;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = &quot;ABC&quot;`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId(&quot;123456&quot;, &quot;MRN&quot;)`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels.&quot;priority&quot;=&quot;high&quot;`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels.&quot;priority&quot;:*`.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="import_">import_(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Import messages to the HL7v2 store by loading data from the specified sources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using import semantics that ignore some HL7v2 store configuration options and are not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into an empty HL7v2 store that is not being used by other clients. An existing message will be overwritten if a duplicate message is imported. A duplicate message is a message with the same raw bytes as a message that already exists in this HL7v2 store. When a message is overwritten, its labels will also be overwritten. The import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple valid messages with the same raw bytes but different labels. In that case, after the import completes, the store contains exactly one message with those raw bytes but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the labels it has. The operation result counters do not count duplicated raw bytes as an error and count one success for each message in the input, which might result in a success count larger than the number of messages in the HL7v2 store. If some messages fail to import, for example due to parsing errors, successfully imported messages are not rolled back. This method returns an Operation that can be used to track the status of the import by calling GetOperation. Immediate fatal errors appear in the error field, errors are also logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)). Otherwise, when the operation finishes, a response of type ImportMessagesResponse is returned in the response field. The metadata field type for this operation is OperationMetadata.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the target HL7v2 store, in the format `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/hl7v2Stores/{hl7v2_store_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to import messages.
  &quot;gcsSource&quot;: { # Specifies the configuration for importing data from Cloud Storage. # Cloud Storage source data location and import configuration. The Cloud Healthcare Service Agent requires the `roles/storage.objectViewer` Cloud IAM roles on the Cloud Storage location.
    &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Points to a Cloud Storage URI containing file(s) to import. The URI must be in the following format: `gs://{bucket_id}/{object_id}`. The URI can include wildcards in `object_id` and thus identify multiple files. Supported wildcards: * `*` to match 0 or more non-separator characters * `**` to match 0 or more characters (including separators). Must be used at the end of a path and with no other wildcards in the path. Can also be used with a file extension (such as .ndjson), which imports all files with the extension in the specified directory and its sub-directories. For example, `gs://my-bucket/my-directory/**.ndjson` imports all files with `.ndjson` extensions in `my-directory/` and its sub-directories. * `?` to match 1 character Files matching the wildcard are expected to contain content only, no metadata.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the HL7v2 stores in the given dataset.

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the dataset. (required)
  filter: string, Restricts stores returned to those matching a filter. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `&quot;query text&quot;`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `&quot;Comment = great&quot;` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it&#x27;s just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Only filtering on labels is supported. For example, `labels.key=value`.
  pageSize: integer, Limit on the number of HL7v2 stores to return in a single response. If not specified, 100 is used. May not be larger than 1000.
  pageToken: string, The next_page_token value returned from the previous List request, if any.

Only the message name is sent as part of the notification. If this is unset, no notifications are sent. Supplied by the client.
        &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail. If a notification can&#x27;t be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).

          &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Restricts notifications sent for messages matching a filter. If this is empty, all messages are matched. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `&quot;query text&quot;`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `&quot;Comment = great&quot;` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it&#x27;s just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Fields/functions available for filtering are: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = &quot;ADT&quot;`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset&#x27;s time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date &lt; &quot;2017-01-02&quot;`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time &lt; &quot;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time &lt; &quot;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = &quot;ABC&quot;`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId(&quot;123456&quot;, &quot;MRN&quot;)`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels.&quot;priority&quot;=&quot;high&quot;`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels.&quot;priority&quot;:*`.

It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. * `PubsubMessage.PublishTime` is the time when the message was published. Note that notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic.

      &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Restricts notifications sent for messages matching a filter. If this is empty, all messages are matched. The following syntax is available: * A string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `&quot;query text&quot;`. The only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. For example, `&quot;Comment = great&quot;` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it&#x27;s just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Fields/functions available for filtering are: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = &quot;ADT&quot;`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset&#x27;s time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date &lt; &quot;2017-01-02&quot;`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time &lt; &quot;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time &lt; &quot;2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = &quot;ABC&quot;`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId(&quot;123456&quot;, &quot;MRN&quot;)`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels.&quot;priority&quot;=&quot;high&quot;`. The operator `:*` can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, `labels.&quot;priority&quot;:*`.
      &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client. The notification is a `PubsubMessage` with the following fields: * `PubsubMessage.Data` contains the resource name. * `PubsubMessage.MessageId` is the ID of this notification. It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. * `PubsubMessage.PublishTime` is the time when the message was published. Note that notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
