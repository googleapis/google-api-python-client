  <pre>Creates a new VMware Engine network that can be used by a private cloud.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the location to create the new VMware Engine network in. A VMware Engine network of type `LEGACY` is a regional resource, and a VMware Engine network of type `STANDARD` is a global resource. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/global` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # VMware Engine network resource that provides connectivity for VMware Engine private clouds.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of this resource.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User-provided description for this VMware Engine network.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Checksum that may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure that the user-provided value is up to date before the server processes a request. The server computes checksums based on the value of other fields in the request.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the VMware Engine network. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/global/vmwareEngineNetworks/my-network`
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the VMware Engine network.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. VMware Engine network type.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. System-generated unique identifier for the resource.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of this resource.
  &quot;vpcNetworks&quot;: [ # Output only. VMware Engine service VPC networks that provide connectivity from a private cloud to customer projects, the internet, and other Google Cloud services.
    { # Represents a VMware Engine VPC network that is managed by a VMware Engine network resource.
      &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The relative resource name of the service VPC network this VMware Engine network is attached to. For example: `projects/123123/global/networks/my-network`
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Type of VPC network (INTRANET, INTERNET, or GOOGLE_CLOUD)
    },
  ],
}

  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  vmwareEngineNetworkId: string, Required. The user-provided identifier of the new VMware Engine network. This identifier must be unique among VMware Engine network resources within the parent and becomes the final token in the name URI. The identifier must meet the following requirements: * For networks of type LEGACY, adheres to the format: `{region-id}-default`. Replace `{region-id}` with the region where you want to create the VMware Engine network. For example, &quot;us-central1-default&quot;. * Only contains 1-63 alphanumeric characters and hyphens * Begins with an alphabetical character * Ends with a non-hyphen character * Not formatted as a UUID * Complies with [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) (section 3.5)

  etag: string, Optional. Checksum used to ensure that the user-provided value is up to date before the server processes the request. The server compares provided checksum with the current checksum of the resource. If the user-provided value is out of date, this request returns an `ABORTED` error.
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests.

The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`. For example, if you are filtering a list of network peerings, you can exclude the ones named `example-network` by specifying `name != &quot;example-network&quot;`. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = &quot;example-network&quot;) (createTime &gt; &quot;2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
