  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

    "displayName": "A String", # A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case without an ending period, for example "Request count". This field is optional but it is recommended to be set for any metrics associated with user-visible concepts, such as Quota.

              # / division (as an infix operator, e.g. 1/s).
              # . multiplication (as an infix operator, e.g. GBy.d)The grammar for a unit is as follows:
              # Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ;
              #
              # Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ]
              #           | Annotation
              #           | "1"

              #
              # Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ;
              # Notes:
              # Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT and is  equivalent to 1 if it is used alone. For examples,  {requests}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s.
              # NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not  containing '{' or '}'.
              # 1 represents dimensionless value 1, such as in 1/s.
              # % represents dimensionless value 1/100, and annotates values giving  a percentage.
          "metadata": { # Additional annotations that can be used to guide the usage of a metric. # Optional. Metadata which can be used to guide usage of the metric.
            "samplePeriod": "A String", # The sampling period of metric data points. For metrics which are written periodically, consecutive data points are stored at this time interval, excluding data loss due to errors. Metrics with a higher granularity have a smaller sampling period.
            "ingestDelay": "A String", # The delay of data points caused by ingestion. Data points older than this age are guaranteed to be ingested and available to be read, excluding data loss due to errors.
            "launchStage": "A String", # Deprecated. Please use the MetricDescriptor.launch_stage instead. The launch stage of the metric definition.
