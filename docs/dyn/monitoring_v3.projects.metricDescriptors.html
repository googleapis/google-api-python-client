  <pre>Creates a new metric descriptor. User-created metric descriptors define custom metrics.

Args:
  name: string, The project on which to execute the request. The format is "projects/{project_id_or_number}". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Defines a metric type and its schema. Once a metric descriptor is created, deleting or altering it stops data collection and makes the metric type's existing data unusable.
    "displayName": "A String", # A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case without an ending period, for example "Request count".
    "description": "A String", # A detailed description of the metric, which can be used in documentation.
    "metricKind": "A String", # Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a value, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported.
    "valueType": "A String", # Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number, etc. Some combinations of metric_kind and value_type might not be supported.
    "labels": [ # The set of labels that can be used to describe a specific instance of this metric type. For example, the appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies metric type has a label for the HTTP response code, response_code, so you can look at latencies for successful responses or just for responses that failed.

    ],
    "type": "A String", # The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-encoded. All user-defined custom metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com. Metric types should use a natural hierarchical grouping. For example:

              # / division (as an infix operator, e.g. 1/s).
              # . multiplication (as an infix operator, e.g. GBy.d)The grammar for a unit is as follows:
              # Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ;
              #
              # Component = [ PREFIX ] UNIT [ Annotation ]
              #           | Annotation
              #           | "1"
              #           ;
              #
              # Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ;
              # Notes:
              # Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT and is  equivalent to 1 if it is used alone. For examples,  {requests}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s.
              # NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not  containing '{' or '}'.
          "name": "A String", # The resource name of the metric descriptor. Depending on the implementation, the name typically includes: (1) the parent resource name that defines the scope of the metric type or of its data; and (2) the metric's URL-encoded type, which also appears in the type field of this descriptor. For example, following is the resource name of a custom metric within the GCP project my-project-id:
              # "projects/my-project-id/metricDescriptors/custom.googleapis.com%2Finvoice%2Fpaid%2Famount"
        },
    ],
