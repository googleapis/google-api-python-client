<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new metric descriptor. User-created metric descriptors define [custom metrics](/monitoring/custom-metrics).

Args:
  name: string, The project on which to execute the request. The format is `"projects/{project_id_or_number}"`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Defines a metric type and its schema.
    "displayName": "A String", # A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case without an ending period, for example "Request count".
    "name": "A String", # Resource name. The format of the name may vary between different implementations. For examples: projects/{project_id}/metricDescriptors/{type=**} metricDescriptors/{type=**}
    "metricKind": "A String", # Whether the metric records instantaneous values, changes to a value, etc.
    "valueType": "A String", # Whether the measurement is an integer, a floating-point number, etc.
    "labels": [ # The set of labels that can be used to describe a specific instance of this metric type. For example, the `compute.googleapis.com/instance/network/received_bytes_count` metric type has a label, `loadbalanced`, that specifies whether the traffic was received through a load balanced IP address.
      { # A description of a label.
        "valueType": "A String", # The type of data that can be assigned to the label.
        "description": "A String", # A human-readable description for the label.
        "key": "A String", # The label key.
      },
    ],
    "type": "A String", # The metric type including a DNS name prefix, for example `"compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization"`. Metric types should use a natural hierarchical grouping such as the following: compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk/read_ops_count compute.googleapis.com/instance/network/received_bytes_count Note that if the metric type changes, the monitoring data will be discontinued, and anything depends on it will break, such as monitoring dashboards, alerting rules and quota limits. Therefore, once a metric has been published, its type should be immutable.
    "unit": "A String", # The unit in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or `DISTRIBUTION`. The supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units of Measure](http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard: **Basic units (UNIT)** * `bit` bit * `By` byte * `s` second * `min` minute * `h` hour * `d` day **Prefixes (PREFIX)** * `k` kilo (10**3) * `M` mega (10**6) * `G` giga (10**9) * `T` tera (10**12) * `P` peta (10**15) * `E` exa (10**18) * `Z` zetta (10**21) * `Y` yotta (10**24) * `m` milli (10**-3) * `u` micro (10**-6) * `n` nano (10**-9) * `p` pico (10**-12) * `f` femto (10**-15) * `a` atto (10**-18) * `z` zepto (10**-21) * `y` yocto (10**-24) * `Ki` kibi (2**10) * `Mi` mebi (2**20) * `Gi` gibi (2**30) * `Ti` tebi (2**40) **Grammar** The grammar includes the dimensionless unit `1`, such as `1/s`. The grammar also includes these connectors: * `/` division (as an infix operator, e.g. `1/s`). * `.` multiplication (as an infix operator, e.g. `GBy.d`) The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = [ PREFIX ] UNIT [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT` and is equivalent to `1` if it is used alone.
