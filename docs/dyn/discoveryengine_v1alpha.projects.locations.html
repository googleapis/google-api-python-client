The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing widths. Although it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include non-finite values (infinities or NaNs) in the population of values, as this will render the `mean` and `sum_of_squared_deviation` fields meaningless. # A distribution value.

If present, `bucket_counts` should contain N values, where N is the number of buckets specified in `bucket_options`. If you supply fewer than N values, the remaining values are assumed to be 0. The order of the values in `bucket_counts` follows the bucket numbering schemes described for the three bucket types. The first value must be the count for the underflow bucket (number 0). The next N-2 values are the counts for the finite buckets (number 1 through N-2). The N&#x27;th value in `bucket_counts` is the count for the overflow bucket (number N-1).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="updateCmekConfig">updateCmekConfig(name, body=None, setDefault=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Provisions a CMEK key for use in a location of a customer&#x27;s project. This method will also conduct location validation on the provided cmekConfig to make sure the key is valid and can be used in the selected location.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the CmekConfig of the form `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/cmekConfig` or `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/cmekConfigs/{cmekConfig}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Configurations used to enable CMEK data encryption with Cloud KMS keys.
  &quot;isDefault&quot;: True or False, # Output only. The default CmekConfig for the Customer.
  &quot;kmsKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # KMS key resource name which will be used to encrypt resources `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyRing}/cryptoKeys/{keyId}`.
  &quot;kmsKeyVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # KMS key version resource name which will be used to encrypt resources `/cryptoKeyVersions/{keyVersion}`.
  &quot;lastRotationTimestampMicros&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp of the last key rotation.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the CmekConfig of the form `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/cmekConfig` or `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/cmekConfigs/{cmekConfig}`.
  &quot;singleRegionKeys&quot;: [ # Optional. Single-regional CMEKs that are required for some VAIS features.
    { # Metadata for single-regional CMEKs.
      &quot;kmsKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Single-regional kms key resource name which will be used to encrypt resources `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyRing}/cryptoKeys/{keyId}`.
    },
  ],
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The states of the CmekConfig.
}

  setDefault: boolean, Set the following CmekConfig as the default to be used for child resources if one is not specified.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
