  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for group by findings.
    "totalSize": 42, # The total number of results matching the query.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # Token to retrieve the next page of results, or empty if there are no more

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="group_next">group_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None, compareDuration=None, pageToken=None, fieldMask=None, readTime=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists an organization or source's findings.

To list across all sources provide a `-` as the source id.
Example: /v1/organizations/123/sources/-/findings

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the source the findings belong to. Its format is
"organizations/[organization_id]/sources/[source_id]". To list across all
sources provide a source_id of `-`. For example:
organizations/123/sources/- (required)
  orderBy: string, Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting. The
string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For
example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default sorting order
is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix " desc"
should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
desc,source_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
syntax are insignificant. "name desc,source_properties.a_property" and "
name     desc  ,   source_properties.a_property  " are equivalent.

The following fields are supported:
name
parent
state
category
resource_name
event_time
source_properties
security_marks
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default is
10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  compareDuration: string, When compare_duration is set, the ListFindingsResult's "state_change"
attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had its state changed,
the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the finding was added in any
state during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the
read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and
read_time.

The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the
finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the
two times don't affect the result. For example, the results aren't affected
if the finding is made inactive and then active again.

Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is specified:

* "CHANGED":   indicates that the finding was present at the start of
                 compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time.
* "UNCHANGED": indicates that the finding was present at the start of
                 compare_duration and did not change state at read_time.
* "ADDED":     indicates that the finding was not present at the start
                 of compare_duration, but was present at read_time.

If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change
is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set for all findings present at
read_time.
  pageToken: string, The value returned by the last `ListFindingsResponse`; indicates
that this is a continuation of a prior `ListFindings` call, and
that the system should return the next page of data.
  fieldMask: string, Optional.

A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be listed in the response.
An empty field mask will list all fields.
  readTime: string, Time used as a reference point when filtering findings. The filter is
limited to findings existing at the supplied time and their values are
those at that specific time. Absence of this field will default to the
API's version of NOW.
  filter: string, Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings.
The expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
operators `AND` and `OR`.
Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`.

Restrictions have the form `<field> <operator> <value>` and may have a `-`
character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include:

 * name
 * source_properties.a_property
 * security_marks.marks.marka

The supported operators are:

* `=` for all value types.
* `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values.
* `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.

The supported value types are:

* string literals in quotes.
* integer literals without quotes.
* boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes.

The following field and operator combinations are supported:

name: `=`
parent: `=`, `:`
resource_name: `=`, `:`
state: `=`, `:`
category: `=`, `:`
external_uri: `=`, `:`
event_time: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
security_marks: `=`, `:`
source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for listing findings.
    "totalSize": 42, # The total number of findings matching the query.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # Token to retrieve the next page of results, or empty if there are no more
