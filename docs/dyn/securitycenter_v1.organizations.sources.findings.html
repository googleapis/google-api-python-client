Args:
  parent: string, Required. Resource name of the new finding&#x27;s parent. Its format should be `organizations/[organization_id]/sources/[source_id]`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Security Command Center finding. A finding is a record of assessment data like security, risk, health, or privacy, that is ingested into Security Command Center for presentation, notification, analysis, policy testing, and enforcement. For example, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an App Engine application is a finding.
  &quot;access&quot;: { # Represents an access event. # Access details associated with the finding, such as more information on the caller, which method was accessed, and from where.
    &quot;callerIp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Caller&#x27;s IP address, such as &quot;1.1.1.1&quot;.
    &quot;callerIpGeo&quot;: { # Represents a geographical location for a given access. # The caller IP&#x27;s geolocation, which identifies where the call came from.
      &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A CLDR.

    &quot;principalEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Associated email, such as &quot;foo@google.com&quot;. The email address of the authenticated user or a service account acting on behalf of a third party principal making the request. For third party identity callers, the `principal_subject` field is populated instead of this field. For privacy reasons, the principal email address is sometimes redacted. For more information, see [Caller identities in audit logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#user-id).
    &quot;principalSubject&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A string that represents the principal_subject that is associated with the identity. Unlike `principal_email`, `principal_subject` supports principals that aren&#x27;t associated with email addresses, such as third party principals. For most identities, the format is `principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool name}/subject/{subject}`. Some GKE identities, such as GKE_WORKLOAD, FREEFORM, and GKE_HUB_WORKLOAD, still use the legacy format `serviceAccount:{identity pool name}[{subject}]`.
    &quot;serviceAccountDelegationInfo&quot;: [ # The identity delegation history of an authenticated service account that made the request. The `serviceAccountDelegationInfo[]` object contains information about the real authorities that try to access Google Cloud resources by delegating on a service account.

  parent: string, Required. Name of the source to groupBy. Its format is `organizations/[organization_id]/sources/[source_id]`, `folders/[folder_id]/sources/[source_id]`, or `projects/[project_id]/sources/[source_id]`. To groupBy across all sources provide a source_id of `-`. For example: `organizations/{organization_id}/sources/-, folders/{folder_id}/sources/-`, or `projects/{project_id}/sources/-` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for grouping by findings.
  &quot;compareDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When compare_duration is set, the GroupResult&#x27;s &quot;state_change&quot; attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had its state changed, the finding&#x27;s state remained unchanged, or if the finding was added during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don&#x27;t affect the result. For example, the results aren&#x27;t affected if the finding is made inactive and then active again. Possible &quot;state_change&quot; values when compare_duration is specified: * &quot;CHANGED&quot;: indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * &quot;UNCHANGED&quot;: indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. * &quot;ADDED&quot;: indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at read_time. * &quot;REMOVED&quot;: indicates that the finding was present and matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is &quot;UNUSED&quot;, which will be the state_change set for all findings present at read_time. If this field is set then `state_change` must be a specified field in `group_by`.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: * name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: * name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:` * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `event_time = &quot;2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00&quot;` `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`, `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : &quot;&quot;` Use a negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : &quot;&quot;` * resource: * resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.type: `=`, `:`
  &quot;groupBy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Expression that defines what assets fields to use for grouping (including `state_change`). The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: &quot;parent,resource_name&quot;. The following fields are supported when compare_duration is set: * state_change
  &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of results to return in a single response. Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
  &quot;pageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The value returned by the last `GroupFindingsResponse`; indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `GroupFindings` call, and that the system should return the next page of data.
  &quot;readTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time used as a reference point when filtering findings. The filter is limited to findings existing at the supplied time and their values are those at that specific time. Absence of this field will default to the API&#x27;s version of NOW.
}

  compareDuration: string, When compare_duration is set, the ListFindingsResult&#x27;s &quot;state_change&quot; attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had its state changed, the finding&#x27;s state remained unchanged, or if the finding was added in any state during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don&#x27;t affect the result. For example, the results aren&#x27;t affected if the finding is made inactive and then active again. Possible &quot;state_change&quot; values when compare_duration is specified: * &quot;CHANGED&quot;: indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * &quot;UNCHANGED&quot;: indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. * &quot;ADDED&quot;: indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at read_time. * &quot;REMOVED&quot;: indicates that the finding was present and matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible state_change is &quot;UNUSED&quot;, which will be the state_change set for all findings present at read_time.
  fieldMask: string, A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
  filter: string, Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: * name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.

  orderBy: string, Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting. The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: &quot;name,resource_properties.a_property&quot;. The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix &quot; desc&quot; should be appended to the field name. For example: &quot;name desc,source_properties.a_property&quot;. Redundant space characters in the syntax are insignificant. &quot;name desc,source_properties.a_property&quot; and &quot; name desc , source_properties.a_property &quot; are equivalent. The following fields are supported: name parent state category resource_name event_time source_properties security_marks.marks

    <code class="details" id="updateSecurityMarks">updateSecurityMarks(name, body=None, startTime=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates security marks.

Args:
  name: string, The relative resource name of the SecurityMarks. See: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name Examples: &quot;organizations/{organization_id}/assets/{asset_id}/securityMarks&quot; &quot;organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}/securityMarks&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # User specified security marks that are attached to the parent Security Command Center resource. Security marks are scoped within a Security Command Center organization -- they can be modified and viewed by all users who have proper permissions on the organization.
  &quot;canonicalName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The canonical name of the marks. Examples: &quot;organizations/{organization_id}/assets/{asset_id}/securityMarks&quot; &quot;folders/{folder_id}/assets/{asset_id}/securityMarks&quot; &quot;projects/{project_number}/assets/{asset_id}/securityMarks&quot; &quot;organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}/securityMarks&quot; &quot;folders/{folder_id}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}/securityMarks&quot; &quot;projects/{project_number}/sources/{source_id}/findings/{finding_id}/securityMarks&quot;
  &quot;marks&quot;: { # Mutable user specified security marks belonging to the parent resource. Constraints are as follows: * Keys and values are treated as case insensitive * Keys must be between 1 - 256 characters (inclusive) * Keys must be letters, numbers, underscores, or dashes * Values have leading and trailing whitespace trimmed, remaining characters must be between 1 - 4096 characters (inclusive)
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,

}

  startTime: string, The time at which the updated SecurityMarks take effect. If not set uses current server time. Updates will be applied to the SecurityMarks that are active immediately preceding this time. Must be earlier or equal to the server time.
  updateMask: string, The FieldMask to use when updating the security marks resource. The field mask must not contain duplicate fields. If empty or set to &quot;marks&quot;, all marks will be replaced. Individual marks can be updated using &quot;marks.&quot;.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
