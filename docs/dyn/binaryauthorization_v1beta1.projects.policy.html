  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource.
Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy
set.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  options_requestedPolicyVersion: integer, Optional. The policy format version to be returned.

Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
rejected.

Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.
Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
leave the field unset.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

      # controls for Google Cloud resources.

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
      # request, the resource, or both.

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
