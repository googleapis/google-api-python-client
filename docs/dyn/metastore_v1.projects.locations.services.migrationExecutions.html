<div class="method">

  <pre>Deletes a single migration execution.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The relative resource name of the migrationExecution to delete, in the following form:projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/services/{service_id}/migrationExecutions/{migration_execution_id}. (required)
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID. Specify a unique request ID to allow the server to ignore the request if it has completed. The server will ignore subsequent requests that provide a duplicate request ID for at least 60 minutes after the first request.For example, if an initial request times out, followed by another request with the same request ID, the server ignores the second request to prevent the creation of duplicate commitments.The request ID must be a valid UUID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Format) A zero UUID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) is not supported.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC (https://github.com/grpc). Each Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the API Design Guide (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should be a resource name ending with operations/{unique_id}.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete, the response is google.protobuf.Empty. If the original method is standard Get/Create/Update, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse, where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot(), the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse.
