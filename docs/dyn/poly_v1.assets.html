More precisely, this quaternion transforms from &quot;object space&quot; (the space in which the object is defined) to &quot;presentation space&quot;, a coordinate system where +Y is up, +X is right, -Z is forward. For example, if the object is the Eiffel Tower, in its local coordinate system the object might be laid out such that the base of the tower is on the YZ plane and the tip of the tower is towards positive X. In this case this quaternion would specify a rotation (of 90 degrees about the Z axis) such that in the presentation space the base of the tower is aligned with the XZ plane, and the tip of the tower lies towards +Y. This rotation is unrelated to the object&#x27;s pose in the web preview, which is just a camera position setting and is *not* reflected in this rotation.
