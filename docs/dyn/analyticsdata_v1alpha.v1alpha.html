  <pre>Returns multiple pivot reports in a batch. All reports must be for the same Entity.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The batch request containing multiple pivot report requests.
  &quot;entity&quot;: { # The unique identifier of the property whose events are tracked. # A property whose events are tracked. This entity must be specified for the batch. The entity within RunPivotReportRequest may either be unspecified or consistent with this entity.
    &quot;propertyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A Google Analytics GA4 property id. To learn more, see [where to find your Property ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id).
  },
  &quot;requests&quot;: [ # Individual requests. Each request has a separate pivot report response. Each batch request is allowed up to 5 requests.
    { # The request to generate a pivot report.
      &quot;cohortSpec&quot;: { # The specification of cohorts for a cohort report. Cohort reports create a time series of user retention for the cohort. For example, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report. # Cohort group associated with this request. If there is a cohort group in the request the &#x27;cohort&#x27; dimension must be present.

            &quot;dateRange&quot;: { # A contiguous set of days: startDate, startDate + 1, ..., endDate. Requests are allowed up to 4 date ranges. # The cohort selects users whose first touch date is between start date and end date defined in the `dateRange`. This `dateRange` does not specify the full date range of event data that is present in a cohort report. In a cohort report, this `dateRange` is extended by the granularity and offset present in the `cohortsRange`; event data for the extended reporting date range is present in a cohort report. In a cohort request, this `dateRange` is required and the `dateRanges` in the `RunReportRequest` or `RunPivotReportRequest` must be unspecified. This `dateRange` should generally be aligned with the cohort&#x27;s granularity. If `CohortsRange` uses daily granularity, this `dateRange` can be a single day. If `CohortsRange` uses weekly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday.

For example, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report. # Cohort group associated with this request.

  <pre>Returns a customized pivot report of your Google Analytics event data. Pivot reports are more advanced and expressive formats than regular reports. In a pivot report, dimensions are only visible if they are included in a pivot. Multiple pivots can be specified to further dissect your data.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request to generate a pivot report.
  &quot;cohortSpec&quot;: { # The specification of cohorts for a cohort report. Cohort reports create a time series of user retention for the cohort. For example, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report. # Cohort group associated with this request. If there is a cohort group in the request the &#x27;cohort&#x27; dimension must be present.
    &quot;cohortReportSettings&quot;: { # Optional settings of a cohort report. # Optional settings for a cohort report.
      &quot;accumulate&quot;: True or False, # If true, accumulates the result from first touch day to the end day. Not supported in `RunReportRequest`.
    },
    &quot;cohorts&quot;: [ # Defines the selection criteria to group users into cohorts. Most cohort reports define only a single cohort. If multiple cohorts are specified, each cohort can be recognized in the report by their name.
      { # Defines a cohort selection criteria. A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic. For example, users with the same `firstSessionDate` belong to the same cohort.
        &quot;dateRange&quot;: { # A contiguous set of days: startDate, startDate + 1, ..., endDate. Requests are allowed up to 4 date ranges. # The cohort selects users whose first touch date is between start date and end date defined in the `dateRange`. This `dateRange` does not specify the full date range of event data that is present in a cohort report. In a cohort report, this `dateRange` is extended by the granularity and offset present in the `cohortsRange`; event data for the extended reporting date range is present in a cohort report. In a cohort request, this `dateRange` is required and the `dateRanges` in the `RunReportRequest` or `RunPivotReportRequest` must be unspecified. This `dateRange` should generally be aligned with the cohort&#x27;s granularity. If `CohortsRange` uses daily granularity, this `dateRange` can be a single day. If `CohortsRange` uses weekly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday. If `CohortsRange` uses monthly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a month, starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month.
          &quot;endDate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The inclusive end date for the query in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Cannot be before `start_date`. The format `NdaysAgo`, `yesterday`, or `today` is also accepted, and in that case, the date is inferred based on the property&#x27;s reporting time zone.
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Assigns a name to this date range. The dimension `dateRange` is valued to this name in a report response. If set, cannot begin with `date_range_` or `RESERVED_`. If not set, date ranges are named by their zero based index in the request: `date_range_0`, `date_range_1`, etc.
          &quot;startDate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The inclusive start date for the query in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Cannot be after `end_date`.

  <pre>Returns a customized report of your Google Analytics event data. Reports contain statistics derived from data collected by the Google Analytics tracking code. The data returned from the API is as a table with columns for the requested dimensions and metrics. Metrics are individual measurements of user activity on your property, such as active users or event count. Dimensions break down metrics across some common criteria, such as country or event name.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request to generate a report.
  &quot;cohortSpec&quot;: { # The specification of cohorts for a cohort report. Cohort reports create a time series of user retention for the cohort. For example, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report. # Cohort group associated with this request. If there is a cohort group in the request the &#x27;cohort&#x27; dimension must be present.
    &quot;cohortReportSettings&quot;: { # Optional settings of a cohort report. # Optional settings for a cohort report.
      &quot;accumulate&quot;: True or False, # If true, accumulates the result from first touch day to the end day. Not supported in `RunReportRequest`.
    },
    &quot;cohorts&quot;: [ # Defines the selection criteria to group users into cohorts. Most cohort reports define only a single cohort. If multiple cohorts are specified, each cohort can be recognized in the report by their name.
      { # Defines a cohort selection criteria. A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic. For example, users with the same `firstSessionDate` belong to the same cohort.
        &quot;dateRange&quot;: { # A contiguous set of days: startDate, startDate + 1, ..., endDate. Requests are allowed up to 4 date ranges. # The cohort selects users whose first touch date is between start date and end date defined in the `dateRange`. This `dateRange` does not specify the full date range of event data that is present in a cohort report. In a cohort report, this `dateRange` is extended by the granularity and offset present in the `cohortsRange`; event data for the extended reporting date range is present in a cohort report. In a cohort request, this `dateRange` is required and the `dateRanges` in the `RunReportRequest` or `RunPivotReportRequest` must be unspecified. This `dateRange` should generally be aligned with the cohort&#x27;s granularity. If `CohortsRange` uses daily granularity, this `dateRange` can be a single day. If `CohortsRange` uses weekly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday. If `CohortsRange` uses monthly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a month, starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month.
          &quot;endDate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The inclusive end date for the query in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Cannot be before `start_date`.

If set, cannot begin with `date_range_` or `RESERVED_`. If not set, date ranges are named by their zero based index in the request: `date_range_0`, `date_range_1`, etc.
          &quot;startDate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The inclusive start date for the query in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Cannot be after `end_date`.

If `granularity` is `DAILY`, the `endDate` of the extended reporting date range is `endDate` of the cohort plus `endOffset` days. If `granularity` is `WEEKLY`, the `endDate` of the extended reporting date range is `endDate` of the cohort plus `endOffset * 7` days. If `granularity` is `MONTHLY`, the `endDate` of the extended reporting date range is `endDate` of the cohort plus `endOffset * 30` days.
      &quot;granularity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The granularity used to interpret the `startOffset` and `endOffset` for the extended reporting date range for a cohort report.
      &quot;startOffset&quot;: 42, # `startOffset` specifies the start date of the extended reporting date range for a cohort report. `startOffset` is commonly set to 0 so that reports contain data from the acquisition of the cohort forward. If `granularity` is `DAILY`, the `startDate` of the extended reporting date range is `startDate` of the cohort plus `startOffset` days. If `granularity` is `WEEKLY`, the `startDate` of the extended reporting date range is `startDate` of the cohort plus `startOffset * 7` days. If `granularity` is `MONTHLY`, the `startDate` of the extended reporting date range is `startDate` of the cohort plus `startOffset * 30` days.
