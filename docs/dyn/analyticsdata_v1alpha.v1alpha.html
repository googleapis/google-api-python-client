<p class="firstline">Returns a customized report of your Google Analytics event data. Reports contain statistics derived from data collected by the Google Analytics tracking code. The data returned from the API is as a table with columns for the requested dimensions and metrics. Metrics are individual measurements of user activity on your property, such as active users or event count. Dimensions break down metrics across some common criteria, such as country or event name.</p>

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

      &quot;granularity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Reporting date range for each cohort is calculated based on these three fields.
      &quot;startOffset&quot;: 42, # For daily cohorts, this will be the start day offset. For weekly cohorts, this will be the week offset.

The date range should be aligned with the cohort&#x27;s granularity. If CohortsRange uses daily granularity, the date range can be aligned to any day. If CohortsRange uses weekly granularity, the date range should be aligned to the week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday. If CohortsRange uses monthly granularity, the date range should be aligned to the month, starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month.
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Assigns a name to this date range. The dimension `dateRange` is valued to this name in a report response. If set, cannot begin with `date_range_` or `RESERVED_`. If not set, date ranges are named by their zero based index in the request: `date_range_0`, `date_range_1`, etc.
          &quot;endDate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The inclusive end date for the query in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Cannot be before `start_date`. The format `NdaysAgo`, `yesterday`, or `today` is also accepted, and in that case, the date is inferred based on the property&#x27;s reporting time zone.

  <pre>Returns a customized report of your Google Analytics event data. Reports contain statistics derived from data collected by the Google Analytics tracking code. The data returned from the API is as a table with columns for the requested dimensions and metrics. Metrics are individual measurements of user activity on your property, such as active users or event count. Dimensions break down metrics across some common criteria, such as country or event name.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
