    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, backupVaultId=None, body=None, requestId=None, validateOnly=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new BackupVault in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Value for parent. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Message describing a BackupVault object.
  &quot;accessRestriction&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Note: This field is added for future use case and will not be supported in the current release. Optional. Access restriction for the backup vault. Default value is WITHIN_ORGANIZATION if not provided during creation.
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Optional. User annotations. See https://google.aip.dev/128#annotations Stores small amounts of arbitrary data.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;backupCount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The number of backups in this backup vault.
  &quot;backupMinimumEnforcedRetentionDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The default and minimum enforced retention for each backup within the backup vault. The enforced retention for each backup can be extended.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the instance was created.
  &quot;deletable&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Set to true when there are no backups nested under this resource.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The description of the BackupVault instance (2048 characters or less).
  &quot;effectiveTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Time after which the BackupVault resource is locked.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Server specified ETag for the backup vault resource to prevent simultaneous updates from overwiting each other.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Resource labels to represent user provided metadata. No labels currently defined:
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Identifier. Name of the backup vault to create. It must have the format`&quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/backupVaults/{backupvault}&quot;`. `{backupvault}` cannot be changed after creation. It must be between 3-63 characters long and must be unique within the project and location.
  &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Service account used by the BackupVault Service for this BackupVault. The user should grant this account permissions in their workload project to enable the service to run backups and restores there.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The BackupVault resource instance state.
  &quot;totalStoredBytes&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Total size of the storage used by all backup resources.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Output only Immutable after resource creation until resource deletion.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the instance was updated.
}

  backupVaultId: string, Required. ID of the requesting object If auto-generating ID server-side, remove this field and backup_vault_id from the method_signature of Create RPC
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. Only validate the request, but do not perform mutations. The default is &#x27;false&#x27;.

Args:
  name: string, Output only. Identifier. Name of the backup vault to create. It must have the format`&quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/backupVaults/{backupvault}&quot;`. `{backupvault}` cannot be changed after creation. It must be between 3-63 characters long and must be unique within the project and location. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Message describing a BackupVault object.
  &quot;accessRestriction&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Note: This field is added for future use case and will not be supported in the current release. Optional. Access restriction for the backup vault. Default value is WITHIN_ORGANIZATION if not provided during creation.
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Optional. User annotations. See https://google.aip.dev/128#annotations Stores small amounts of arbitrary data.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },

  &quot;backupMinimumEnforcedRetentionDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The default and minimum enforced retention for each backup within the backup vault. The enforced retention for each backup can be extended.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the instance was created.
  &quot;deletable&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Set to true when there are no backups nested under this resource.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The description of the BackupVault instance (2048 characters or less).
  &quot;effectiveTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Time after which the BackupVault resource is locked.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Server specified ETag for the backup vault resource to prevent simultaneous updates from overwiting each other.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Resource labels to represent user provided metadata. No labels currently defined:
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Identifier. Name of the backup vault to create. It must have the format`&quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/backupVaults/{backupvault}&quot;`. `{backupvault}` cannot be changed after creation. It must be between 3-63 characters long and must be unique within the project and location.
  &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Service account used by the BackupVault Service for this BackupVault. The user should grant this account permissions in their workload project to enable the service to run backups and restores there.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The BackupVault resource instance state.
  &quot;totalStoredBytes&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Total size of the storage used by all backup resources.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Output only Immutable after resource creation until resource deletion.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the instance was updated.
}

  force: boolean, Optional. If set to true, will not check plan duration against backup vault enforcement duration.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the BackupVault resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then the request will fail.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. Only validate the request, but do not perform mutations. The default is &#x27;false&#x27;.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
