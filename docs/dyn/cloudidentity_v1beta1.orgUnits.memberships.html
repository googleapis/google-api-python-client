  <pre>List OrgMembership resources in an OrgUnit treated as &#x27;parent&#x27;. Parent format: orgUnits/{$orgUnitId} where `$orgUnitId` is the `orgUnitId` from the [Admin SDK `OrgUnit` resource](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/orgunits)

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Immutable. OrgUnit which is queried for a list of memberships. Format: orgUnits/{$orgUnitId} where `$orgUnitId` is the `orgUnitId` from the [Admin SDK `OrgUnit` resource](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/orgunits). (required)
  customer: string, Required. Immutable. Customer that this OrgMembership belongs to. All authorization will happen on the role assignments of this customer. Format: customers/{$customerId} where `$customerId` is the `id` from the [Admin SDK `Customer` resource](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/customers). You may also use `customers/my_customer` to specify your own organization.
  filter: string, The search query. Must be specified in [Common Expression Language](https://opensource.google/projects/cel). May only contain equality operators on the `type` (e.g., `type == &#x27;shared_drive&#x27;`).
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of results to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If omitted (or defaulted to zero) the server will default to 50. The maximum allowed value is 100, though requests with page_size greater than that will be silently interpreted as 100.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `OrgMembershipsService.ListOrgMemberships` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListOrgMembershipsRequest` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response message for OrgMembershipsService.ListOrgMemberships.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A token, which can be sent as `page_token` to retrieve the next page. If this field is empty, there are no subsequent pages.
  &quot;orgMemberships&quot;: [ # The non-vacuous membership in an orgUnit.
    { # A membership in an OrgUnit. An `OrgMembership` defines a relationship between an `OrgUnit` and an entity belonging to that `OrgUnit`, referred to as a &quot;member&quot;.
      &quot;member&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Org member id as full resource name. Format for shared drive resource: //drive.googleapis.com/drives/{$memberId} where `$memberId` is the `id` from [Drive API (V3) `Drive` resource](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/drives#resource).
      &quot;memberUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Uri with which you can read the member. This follows https://aip.dev/122 Format for shared drive resource: https://drive.googleapis.com/drive/v3/drives/{$memberId} where `$memberId` is the `id` from [Drive API (V3) `Drive` resource](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/drives#resource).
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The [resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the OrgMembership. Format: orgUnits/{$orgUnitId}/memberships/{$membership} The `$orgUnitId` is the `orgUnitId` from the [Admin SDK `OrgUnit` resource](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/orgunits). The `$membership` shall be of the form `{$entityType};{$memberId}`, where `$entityType` is the enum value of [OrgMembership.EntityType], and `memberId` is the `id` from [Drive API (V3) `Drive` resource](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/drives#resource) for OrgMembership.EntityType.SHARED_DRIVE.
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Entity type for the org member.

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="move">move(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Move an OrgMembership to a new OrgUnit. NOTE: This is an atomic copy-and-delete. The resource will have a new copy under the destination OrgUnit and be deleted from the source OrgUnit. The resource can only be searched under the destination OrgUnit afterwards.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Immutable. The [resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the OrgMembership. Format: orgUnits/{$orgUnitId}/memberships/{$membership} The `$orgUnitId` is the `orgUnitId` from the [Admin SDK `OrgUnit` resource](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/orgunits). To manage a Membership without specifying source `orgUnitId`, this API also supports the wildcard character &#x27;-&#x27; for `$orgUnitId` per https://google.aip.dev/159. The `$membership` shall be of the form `{$entityType};{$memberId}`, where `$entityType` is the enum value of OrgMembership.EntityType, and `memberId` is the `id` from [Drive API (V3) `Drive` resource](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/drives#resource) for OrgMembership.EntityType.SHARED_DRIVE.

Format: orgUnits/{$orgUnitId} where `$orgUnitId` is the `orgUnitId` from the [Admin SDK `OrgUnit` resource](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/orgunits).
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
