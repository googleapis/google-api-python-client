  <pre>Retrieve shipping setting information.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the shipping setting to retrieve. Format: `accounts/{account}/shippingsetting` (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. This field is used for avoid async issue. Make sure shipping setting data didn&#x27;t change between get call and insert call. The user should do following steps： 1. Set etag field as empty string for initial shipping setting creation. 2. After initial creation, call get method to obtain an etag and current shipping setting data before call insert. 3. Modify to wanted shipping setting information. 4. Call insert method with the wanted shipping setting information with the etag obtained from step 2. 5. If shipping setting data changed between step 2 and step 4. Insert request will fail because the etag changes every time the shipping setting data changes. User should repeate step 2-4 with the new etag.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The account where this product will be inserted. Format: accounts/{account} (required)

Call insert method with the wanted shipping setting information with the etag obtained from step 2. 5. If shipping setting data changed between step 2 and step 4. Insert request will fail because the etag changes every time the shipping setting data changes. User should repeate step 2-4 with the new etag.
