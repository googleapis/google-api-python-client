  <pre>Creates a policy.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource that the policy is attached to, along with the kind of policy to create. Format: `policies/{attachment_point}/denypolicies` The attachment point is identified by its URL-encoded full resource name, which means that the forward-slash character, `/`, must be written as `%2F`. For example, `policies/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2Fmy-project/denypolicies`. For organizations and folders, use the numeric ID in the full resource name. For projects, you can use the alphanumeric or the numeric ID. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Data for an IAM policy.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An opaque tag that identifies the current version of the `Policy`.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The resource name of the `Policy`, which must be unique. Format: `policies/{attachment_point}/denypolicies/{policy_id}` The attachment point is identified by its URL-encoded full resource name, which means that the forward-slash character, `/`, must be written as `%2F`. For example, `policies/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2Fmy-project/denypolicies/my-deny-policy`. For organizations and folders, use the numeric ID in the full resource name. For projects, requests can use the alphanumeric or the numeric ID. Responses always contain the numeric ID.

  <pre>Retrieves the policies of the specified kind that are attached to a resource. The response lists only policy metadata. In particular, policy rules are omitted.

Args:

For projects, you can use the alphanumeric or the numeric ID. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of policies to return. IAM ignores this value and uses the value 1000.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
