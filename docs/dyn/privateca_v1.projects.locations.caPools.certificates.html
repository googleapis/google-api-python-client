}

  certificateId: string, Optional. It must be unique within a location and match the regular expression `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,63}`. This field is required when using a CertificateAuthority in the Enterprise CertificateAuthority.Tier, but is optional and its value is ignored otherwise.
  issuingCertificateAuthorityId: string, Optional. The resource ID of the CertificateAuthority that should issue the certificate. This optional field will ignore the load-balancing scheme of the Pool and directly issue the certificate from the CA with the specified ID, contained in the same CaPool referenced by `parent`. Per-CA quota rules apply. If left empty, a CertificateAuthority will be chosen from the CaPool by the service. For example, to issue a Certificate from a Certificate Authority with resource name &quot;projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/caPools/my-pool/certificateAuthorities/my-ca&quot;, you can set the parent to &quot;projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/caPools/my-pool&quot; and the issuing_certificate_authority_id to &quot;my-ca&quot;.
  requestId: string, Optional. An ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If this is true, no Certificate resource will be persisted regardless of the CaPool&#x27;s tier, and the returned Certificate will not contain the pem_certificate field.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  requestId: string, Optional. An ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="revoke">revoke(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Revoke a Certificate.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name for this Certificate in the format `projects/*/locations/*/caPools/*/certificates/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CertificateAuthorityService.RevokeCertificate.
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The RevocationReason for revoking this certificate.
  &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
