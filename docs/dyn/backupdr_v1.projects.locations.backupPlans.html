      &quot;standardSchedule&quot;: { # `StandardSchedule` defines a schedule that run within the confines of a defined window of days. We can define recurrence type for schedule as HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY or YEARLY. # Required. Defines a schedule that runs within the confines of a defined window of time.
        &quot;backupWindow&quot;: { # `BackupWindow` defines a window of the day during which backup jobs will run. # Required. A BackupWindow defines the window of day during which backup jobs will run. Jobs are queued at the beginning of the window and will be marked as `NOT_RUN` if they do not start by the end of the window. Note: running jobs will not be cancelled at the end of the window.
          &quot;endHourOfDay&quot;: 42, # Required. The hour of day (1-24) when the window end for e.g. if value of end hour of day is 10 that mean backup window end time is 10:00.

This is required for `recurrence_type`, `HOURLY` and is not applicable otherwise. A validation error will occur if a value is supplied and `recurrence_type` is not `HOURLY`. Value of hourly frequency should be between 6 and 23. Reason for limit : We found that there is bandwidth limitation of 3GB/S for GMI while taking a backup and 5GB/S while doing a restore.

The message combines a `WeekOfMonth` and `DayOfWeek` to produce values like `FIRST`/`MONDAY` or `LAST`/`FRIDAY`. # Optional. Specifies a week day of the month like, FIRST SUNDAY or LAST MONDAY, on which jobs will run. This will be specified by two fields in `WeekDayOfMonth`, one for the day, e.g. `MONDAY`, and one for the week, e.g. `LAST`.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
