Minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 90 for daily backups. Minimum value is 7 and maximum value is 186 for weekly backups. Minimum value is 30 and maximum value is 732 for monthly backups. Minimum value is 365 and maximum value is 36159 for yearly backups.

      &quot;standardSchedule&quot;: { # `StandardSchedule` defines a schedule that run within the confines of a defined window of days. We can define recurrence type for schedule as HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY or YEARLY. # Required. Defines a schedule that runs within the confines of a defined window of time.
        &quot;backupWindow&quot;: { # `BackupWindow` defines a window of the day during which backup jobs will run. # Required. A BackupWindow defines the window of day during which backup jobs will run. Jobs are queued at the beginning of the window and will be marked as `NOT_RUN` if they do not start by the end of the window. Note: running jobs will not be cancelled at the end of the window.
          &quot;endHourOfDay&quot;: 42, # Required. The hour of day (1-24) when the window end for e.g. if value of end hour of day is 10 that mean backup window end time is 10:00.

This is required for `recurrence_type`, `HOURLY` and is not applicable otherwise. A validation error will occur if a value is supplied and `recurrence_type` is not `HOURLY`. Value of hourly frequency should be between 4 and 23. Reason for limit : We found that there is bandwidth limitation of 3GB/S for GMI while taking a backup and 5GB/S while doing a restore.

        &quot;weekDayOfMonth&quot;: { # `WeekDayOfMonth` defines the week day of the month on which the backups will run. The message combines a `WeekOfMonth` and `DayOfWeek` to produce values like `FIRST`/`MONDAY` or `LAST`/`FRIDAY`. # Optional. Specifies a week day of the month like, FIRST SUNDAY or LAST MONDAY, on which jobs will run. This will be specified by two fields in `WeekDayOfMonth`, one for the day, e.g. `MONDAY`, and one for the week, e.g. `LAST`.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Note that the response may include a partial list and a caller should only rely on the response&#x27;s next_page_token to determine if there are more instances left to be queried.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The value of next_page_token received from a previous `ListBackupPlans` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page in a multi-page list of results. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListBackupPlans` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  An object of the form:

  &quot;backupPlans&quot;: [ # The list of `BackupPlans` in the project for the specified location. If the `{location}` value in the request is &quot;-&quot;, the response contains a list of resources from all locations.

    { # A `BackupPlan` specifies some common fields, such as `description` as well as one or more `BackupRule` messages. Each `BackupRule` has a retention policy and defines a schedule by which the system is to perform backup workloads.

          &quot;backupRetentionDays&quot;: 42, # Required. Configures the duration for which backup data will be kept. It is defined in “days”. The value should be greater than or equal to minimum enforced retention of the backup vault. Minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 90 for hourly backups. Minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 90 for daily backups. Minimum value is 7 and maximum value is 186 for weekly backups. Minimum value is 30 and maximum value is 732 for monthly backups. Minimum value is 365 and maximum value is 36159 for yearly backups.

            &quot;backupWindow&quot;: { # `BackupWindow` defines a window of the day during which backup jobs will run. # Required. A BackupWindow defines the window of day during which backup jobs will run. Jobs are queued at the beginning of the window and will be marked as `NOT_RUN` if they do not start by the end of the window. Note: running jobs will not be cancelled at the end of the window.
              &quot;endHourOfDay&quot;: 42, # Required. The hour of day (1-24) when the window end for e.g. if value of end hour of day is 10 that mean backup window end time is 10:00. End hour of day should be greater than start hour of day. 0 &lt;= start_hour_of_day &lt; end_hour_of_day &lt;= 24 End hour of day is not include in backup window that mean if end_hour_of_day= 10 jobs should start before 10:00.

This is required for `recurrence_type`, `HOURLY` and is not applicable otherwise. A validation error will occur if a value is supplied and `recurrence_type` is not `HOURLY`. Value of hourly frequency should be between 4 and 23. Reason for limit : We found that there is bandwidth limitation of 3GB/S for GMI while taking a backup and 5GB/S while doing a restore. Given the amount of parallel backups and restore we are targeting, this will potentially take the backup time to mins and hours (in worst case scenario).
            &quot;months&quot;: [ # Optional. Specifies the months of year, like `FEBRUARY` and/or `MAY`, on which jobs will run. This field is only applicable when `recurrence_type` is `YEARLY`. A validation error will occur if other values are supplied.

The message combines a `WeekOfMonth` and `DayOfWeek` to produce values like `FIRST`/`MONDAY` or `LAST`/`FRIDAY`. # Optional. Specifies a week day of the month like, FIRST SUNDAY or LAST MONDAY, on which jobs will run. This will be specified by two fields in `WeekDayOfMonth`, one for the day, e.g. `MONDAY`, and one for the week, e.g. `LAST`. This field is only applicable for `recurrence_type`, `MONTHLY` and `YEARLY`. A validation error will occur if other values are supplied.

      &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. `etag` is returned from the service in the response. As a user of the service, you may provide an etag value in this field to prevent stale resources.
      &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. This collection of key/value pairs allows for custom labels to be supplied by the user. Example, {&quot;tag&quot;: &quot;Weekly&quot;}.
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
