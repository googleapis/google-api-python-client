<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, mirroringEndpointGroupId=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new MirroringEndpointGroup in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Value for parent. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Message describing MirroringEndpointGroup object. Next ID: 10
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Create time stamp
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels as key value pairs
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;mirroringDeploymentGroup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The Mirroring Deployment Group that this resource is connected to. Format is: `projects/{project}/locations/global/mirroringDeploymentGroups/{mirroringDeploymentGroup}`
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Identifier. The name of the MirroringEndpointGroup.
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Whether reconciling is in progress, recommended per https://google.aip.dev/128.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Current state of the endpoint group.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Update time stamp
}

  mirroringEndpointGroupId: string, Required. Id of the requesting object If auto-generating Id server-side, remove this field and mirroring_endpoint_group_id from the method_signature of Create RPC
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
