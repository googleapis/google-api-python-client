<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(playerId, leaderboardId, timeSpan, includeRankType=None, language=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None)</code>
  <pre>Get high scores, and optionally ranks, in leaderboards for the currently authenticated player. For a specific time span, leaderboardId can be set to ALL to retrieve data for all leaderboards in a given time span.
NOTE: You cannot ask for 'ALL' leaderboards and 'ALL' timeSpans in the same request; only one parameter may be set to 'ALL'.

Args:
  playerId: string, A player ID. A value of me may be used in place of the authenticated player's ID. (required)
  leaderboardId: string, The ID of the leaderboard. Can be set to 'ALL' to retrieve data for all leaderboards for this application. (required)
  timeSpan: string, The time span for the scores and ranks you're requesting. (required)
    Allowed values
      ALL - Get the high scores for all time spans. If this is used, maxResults values will be ignored.

      DAILY - List the top scores for the current day.
      WEEKLY - List the top scores for the current week.

      PUBLIC - Retrieve public ranks, if the player is sharing their gameplay activity publicly.
      SOCIAL - Retrieve the social rank.
  language: string, The preferred language to use for strings returned by this method.
