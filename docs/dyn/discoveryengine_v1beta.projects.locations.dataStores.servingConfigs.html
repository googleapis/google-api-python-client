  <pre>Makes a recommendation, which requires a contextual user event.

Args:
  servingConfig: string, Required. Full resource name of the format: projects/*/locations/global/collections/*/dataStores/*/servingConfigs/* Before you can request recommendations from your model, you must create at least one serving config for it. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for Recommend method.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Filter for restricting recommendation results with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Currently, only filter expressions on the `filter_tags` attribute is supported. Examples: * (filter_tags: ANY(&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;) OR filter_tags: ANY(&quot;Hot&quot;, &quot;Cold&quot;)) * (filter_tags: ANY(&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;)) AND NOT (filter_tags: ANY(&quot;Green&quot;)) If your filter blocks all results, the API will return generic (unfiltered) popular Documents. If you only want results strictly matching the filters, set `strictFiltering` to True in RecommendRequest.params to receive empty results instead. Note that the API will never return Documents with storageStatus of &quot;EXPIRED&quot; or &quot;DELETED&quot; regardless of filter choices.
  &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # Maximum number of results to return. Set this property to the number of recommendation results needed. If zero, the service will choose a reasonable default. The maximum allowed value is 100. Values above 100 will be coerced to 100.
  &quot;params&quot;: { # Additional domain specific parameters for the recommendations. Allowed values: * `returnDocument`: Boolean. If set to true, the associated Document object will be returned in RecommendResponse.results.document. * `returnScore`: Boolean. If set to true, the recommendation &#x27;score&#x27; corresponding to each returned Document will be set in RecommendResponse.results.metadata. The given &#x27;score&#x27; indicates the probability of a Document conversion given the user&#x27;s context and history. * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to false, the service will return generic (unfiltered) popular Documents instead of empty if your filter blocks all recommendation results. * `diversityLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then it needs to be one of: * &#x27;no-diversity&#x27; * &#x27;low-diversity&#x27; * &#x27;medium-diversity&#x27; * &#x27;high-diversity&#x27; * &#x27;auto-diversity&#x27; This gives request-level control and adjusts recommendation results based on Document category.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  },
  &quot;userEvent&quot;: { # UserEvent captures all metadata information Discovery Engine API needs to know about how end users interact with customers&#x27; website. # Required. Context about the user, what they are looking at and what action they took to trigger the Recommend request. Note that this user event detail won&#x27;t be ingested to userEvent logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write request is required for event logging. Don&#x27;t set UserEvent.user_pseudo_id or UserEvent.user_info.user_id to the same fixed ID for different users. If you are trying to receive non-personalized recommendations (not recommended; this can negatively impact model performance), instead set UserEvent.user_pseudo_id to a random unique ID and leave UserEvent.user_info.user_id unset.
    &quot;attributes&quot;: { # Extra user event features to include in the recommendation model. These attributes must NOT contain data that needs to be parsed or processed further, e.g. JSON or other encodings. If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events, also include them in the user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events provided with prediction requests. This lets the Discovery Engine API use those custom attributes when training models and serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality. This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. For product recommendations, an example of extra user information is traffic_channel, which is how a user arrives at the site. Users can arrive at the site by coming to the site directly, coming through Google search, or in other ways.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: { # A custom attribute that is not explicitly modeled in a resource, e.g. UserEvent.
        &quot;numbers&quot;: [ # The numerical values of this custom attribute. For example, `[2.3, 15.4]` when the key is &quot;lengths_cm&quot;. Exactly one of text or numbers should be set. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
          3.14,
        ],
        &quot;text&quot;: [ # The textual values of this custom attribute. For example, `[&quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;]` when the key is &quot;color&quot;. Empty string is not allowed. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. Exactly one of text or numbers should be set. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
      },
    },
    &quot;attributionToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Token to attribute an API response to user action(s) to trigger the event. Highly recommended for user events that are the result of PredictionService.Predict. This field enables accurate attribution of recommendation model performance. The value must be one of: * PredictResponse.attribution_token for events that are the result of PredictionService.Predict. * SearchResponse.attribution_token for events that are the result of SearchService.Search. * CompleteQueryResponse.attribution_token for events that are the result of SearchService.CompleteQuery. This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or conversion completion back to the event and the particular predict response containing this clicked/purchased product. If user clicks on product K in the recommendation results, pass PredictResponse.attribution_token as a URL parameter to product K&#x27;s page. When recording events on product K&#x27;s page, log the PredictResponse.attribution_token to this field.
    &quot;completionInfo&quot;: { # Detailed completion information including completion attribution token and clicked completion info. # CompleteQuery API details related to the event. This field should be set for `search` event when autocomplete function is enabled and the user clicks a suggestion for search.
      &quot;selectedPosition&quot;: 42, # End user selected CompleteQueryResponse.CompletionResult.suggestion position, starting from 0.
      &quot;selectedSuggestion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # End user selected CompleteQueryResponse.CompletionResult.suggestion.
    },
    &quot;directUserRequest&quot;: True or False, # Should set to true if the request is made directly from the end user, in which case the UserEvent.user_info.user_agent can be populated from the HTTP request. This flag should be set only if the API request is made directly from the end user such as a mobile app (and not if a gateway or a server is processing and pushing the user events). This should not be set when using the JavaScript tag in UserEventService.CollectUserEvent.
    &quot;documents&quot;: [ # List of Documents associated with this user event. This field is optional except for the following event types: * `view-item` * `add-to-cart` * `purchase` * `media-play` * `media-complete` In a `search` event, this field represents the documents returned to the end user on the current page (the end user may have not finished browsing the whole page yet). When a new page is returned to the end user, after pagination/filtering/ordering even for the same query, a new `search` event with different UserEvent.documents is desired.
      { # Detailed document information associated with a user event.
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The Document resource ID.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The Document resource full name, of the form: projects/{project\_id}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection\_id}/dataStores/{data\_store\_id}/branches/{branch\_id}/documents/{document\_id}

          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;quantity&quot;: 42, # Quantity of the Document associated with the user event. Defaults to 1. For example, this field will be 2 if two quantities of the same Document are involved in a `add-to-cart` event. Required for events of the following event types: * `add-to-cart` * `purchase`
      },
    ],
    &quot;eventTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Only required for UserEventService.ImportUserEvents method. Timestamp of when the user event happened.
    &quot;eventType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. User event type. Allowed values are: Generic values: * `search`: Search for Documents. * `view-item`: Detailed page view of a Document. * `view-item-list`: View of a panel or ordered list of Documents. * `view-home-page`: View of the home page. * `view-category-page`: View of a category page, e.g. Home &gt; Men &gt; Jeans Retail-related values: * `add-to-cart`: Add an item(s) to cart, e.g. in Retail online shopping * `purchase`: Purchase an item(s) Media-related values: * `media-play`: Start/resume watching a video, playing a song, etc. * `media-complete`: Finished or stopped midway through a video, song, etc.
    &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The filter syntax consists of an expression language for constructing a predicate from one or more fields of the documents being filtered. One example is for `search` events, the associated SearchService.SearchRequest may contain a filter expression in SearchService.SearchRequest.filter conforming to https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering. Similarly, for `view-item-list` events that are generated from a PredictionService.PredictRequest, this field may be populated directly from PredictionService.PredictRequest.filter conforming to https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering. The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
    &quot;mediaInfo&quot;: { # Media-specific user event information. # Media-specific info.
      &quot;mediaProgressDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The media progress time in seconds, if applicable. For example, if the end user has finished 90 seconds of a playback video, then MediaInfo.media_progress_duration.seconds should be set to 90.
      &quot;mediaProgressPercentage&quot;: 3.14, # Media progress should be computed using only the media_progress_duration relative to the media total length. This value must be between [0, 1.0] inclusive. If this is not a playback or the progress cannot be computed (e.g. ongoing livestream), this field should be unset.
    },
    &quot;pageInfo&quot;: { # Detailed page information. # Page metadata such as categories and other critical information for certain event types such as `view-category-page`.
      &quot;pageCategory&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The most specific category associated with a category page. To represent full path of category, use &#x27;&gt;&#x27; sign to separate different hierarchies. If &#x27;&gt;&#x27; is part of the category name, please replace it with other character(s). Category pages include special pages such as sales or promotions. For instance, a special sale page may have the category hierarchy: &quot;pageCategory&quot; : &quot;Sales &gt; 2017 Black Friday Deals&quot;. Required for `view-category-page` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
      &quot;pageviewId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique ID of a web page view. This should be kept the same for all user events triggered from the same pageview. For example, an item detail page view could trigger multiple events as the user is browsing the page. The `pageViewId` property should be kept the same for all these events so that they can be grouped together properly. When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in automatically.
      &quot;referrerUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The referrer URL of the current page. When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in automatically. However, some browser privacy restrictions may cause this field to be empty.
      &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Complete URL (window.location.href) of the user&#x27;s current page. When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in automatically. Maximum length 5,000 characters.

      &quot;offset&quot;: 42, # An integer that specifies the current offset for pagination (the 0-indexed starting location, amongst the products deemed by the API as relevant). See SearchRequest.offset for definition. If this field is negative, an INVALID_ARGUMENT is returned. This can only be set for `search` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
      &quot;orderBy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The order in which products are returned, if applicable. See SearchRequest.order_by for definition and syntax. The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. This can only be set for `search` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
      &quot;searchQuery&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The user&#x27;s search query. See SearchRequest.query for definition. The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. At least one of search_query or page_categories is required for `search` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

    &quot;sessionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique identifier for tracking a visitor session with a length limit of 128 bytes. A session is an aggregation of an end user behavior in a time span. A general guideline to populate the session_id: 1. If user has no activity for 30 min, a new session_id should be assigned. 2. The session_id should be unique across users, suggest use uuid or add UserEvent.user_pseudo_id as prefix.

      &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Highly recommended for logged-in users. Unique identifier for logged-in user, such as a user name. Don&#x27;t set for anonymous users. Always use a hashed value for this ID. Don&#x27;t set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters.

For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if the visitor log in/out of the website. Do not set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend to use Google Analytics [Client ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId) for this field.

Values can be empty and have a maximum length of 63 characters. * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. * The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you can use the same key with multiple resources. * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character.
