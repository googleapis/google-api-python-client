The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Cloud Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone. Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this: compute.googleapis.com/projects/project-id/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard
