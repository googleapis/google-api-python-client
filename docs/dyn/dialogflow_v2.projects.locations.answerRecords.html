    { # Answer records are records to manage answer history and feedbacks for Dialogflow. Currently, answer record includes: - human agent assistant article suggestion - human agent assistant faq article It doesn&#x27;t include: - `DetectIntent` intent matching - `DetectIntent` knowledge Answer records are not related to the conversation history in the Dialogflow Console. A Record is generated even when the end-user disables conversation history in the console. Records are created when there&#x27;s a human agent assistant suggestion generated. A typical workflow for customers provide feedback to an answer is: 1. For human agent assistant, customers get suggestion via ListSuggestions API. Together with the answers, AnswerRecord.name are returned to the customers. 2. The customer uses the AnswerRecord.name to call the UpdateAnswerRecord method to send feedback about a specific answer that they believe is wrong.

Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active.

{ # Answer records are records to manage answer history and feedbacks for Dialogflow. Currently, answer record includes: - human agent assistant article suggestion - human agent assistant faq article It doesn&#x27;t include: - `DetectIntent` intent matching - `DetectIntent` knowledge Answer records are not related to the conversation history in the Dialogflow Console. A Record is generated even when the end-user disables conversation history in the console. Records are created when there&#x27;s a human agent assistant suggestion generated. A typical workflow for customers provide feedback to an answer is: 1. For human agent assistant, customers get suggestion via ListSuggestions API. Together with the answers, AnswerRecord.name are returned to the customers. 2. The customer uses the AnswerRecord.name to call the UpdateAnswerRecord method to send feedback about a specific answer that they believe is wrong.

            { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
              &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.

The `Context ID` is always converted to lowercase, may only contain characters in `a-zA-Z0-9_-%` and may be at most 250 bytes long. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow. You should not use these contexts or create contexts with these names: * `__system_counters__` * `*_id_dialog_context` * `*_dialog_params_size`

Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`, and `user_defined` fields are all set.

        &quot;intentDetectionConfidence&quot;: 3.14, # The intent detection confidence. Values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). This value is for informational purpose only and is only used to help match the best intent within the classification threshold. This value may change for the same end-user expression at any time due to a model retraining or change in implementation. If there are `multiple knowledge_answers` messages, this value is set to the greatest `knowledgeAnswers.match_confidence` value in the list.

          { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
            &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.

If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow. You should not use these contexts or create contexts with these names: * `__system_counters__` * `*_id_dialog_context` * `*_dialog_params_size`
            &quot;parameters&quot;: { # Optional. The collection of parameters associated with this context. Depending on your protocol or client library language, this is a map, associative array, symbol table, dictionary, or JSON object composed of a collection of (MapKey, MapValue) pairs: * MapKey type: string * MapKey value: parameter name * MapValue type: If parameter&#x27;s entity type is a composite entity then use map, otherwise, depending on the parameter value type, it could be one of string, number, boolean, null, list or map. * MapValue value: If parameter&#x27;s entity type is a composite entity then use map from composite entity property names to property values, otherwise, use parameter value.

A higher number indicates an estimated greater likelihood that the recognized words are correct. The default of 0.0 is a sentinel value indicating that confidence was not set. This field is not guaranteed to be accurate or set.

Currently, answer record includes: - human agent assistant article suggestion - human agent assistant faq article It doesn&#x27;t include: - `DetectIntent` intent matching - `DetectIntent` knowledge Answer records are not related to the conversation history in the Dialogflow Console. A Record is generated even when the end-user disables conversation history in the console. Records are created when there&#x27;s a human agent assistant suggestion generated. A typical workflow for customers provide feedback to an answer is: 1. For human agent assistant, customers get suggestion via ListSuggestions API. Together with the answers, AnswerRecord.name are returned to the customers. 2. The customer uses the AnswerRecord.name to call the UpdateAnswerRecord method to send feedback about a specific answer that they believe is wrong.

Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts.
