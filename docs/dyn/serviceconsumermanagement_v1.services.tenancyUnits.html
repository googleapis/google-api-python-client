  <pre>Add a new tenant project to the tenancy unit.
There can be a maximum of 512 tenant projects in a tenancy unit.
If there are previously failed `AddTenantProject` calls, you might need to
call `RemoveTenantProject` first to resolve them before you can make
another call to `AddTenantProject` with the same tag.
