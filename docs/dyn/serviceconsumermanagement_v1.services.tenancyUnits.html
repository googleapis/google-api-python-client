  <pre>Add a new tenant project to the tenancy unit.
There can be a maximum of 512 tenant projects in a tenancy unit.
If there are previously failed `AddTenantProject` calls, you might need to
call `RemoveTenantProject` first to resolve them before you can make
another call to `AddTenantProject` with the same tag.

The mothod removes a project lien with a 'TenantManager' origin if that was

DELETED.  To permanently remove resource metadata, call the
`RemoveTenantProject` method.
New resources with the same tag can't be added if there are existing
resources in a DELETED state.
