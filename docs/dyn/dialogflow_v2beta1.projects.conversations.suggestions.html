  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for Conversations.SearchKnowledge.
  &quot;conversation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The conversation (between human agent and end user) where the search request is triggered. Format: `projects//locations//conversations/`.
  &quot;conversationProfile&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The conversation profile used to configure the search. Format: `projects//locations//conversationProfiles/`.
  &quot;endUserMetadata&quot;: { # Optional. Information about the end-user to improve the relevance and accuracy of generative answers. This will be interpreted and used by a language model, so, for good results, the data should be self-descriptive, and in a simple structure. Example: ```json { &quot;subscription plan&quot;: &quot;Business Premium Plus&quot;, &quot;devices owned&quot;: [ {&quot;model&quot;: &quot;Google Pixel 7&quot;}, {&quot;model&quot;: &quot;Google Pixel Tablet&quot;} ] } ```
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object.
  },
  &quot;exactSearch&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether to search the query exactly without query rewrite.
  &quot;latestMessage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the latest conversation message when the request is triggered. Format: `projects//locations//conversations//messages/`.
  &quot;parent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The parent resource contains the conversation profile Format: &#x27;projects/&#x27; or `projects//locations/`.
  &quot;query&quot;: { # Represents the natural language text to be processed. # Required. The natural language text query for knowledge search.
    &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The language of this conversational query. See [Language Support](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/reference/language) for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The UTF-8 encoded natural language text to be processed. Text length must not exceed 256 characters for virtual agent interactions.
  },
  &quot;querySource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The source of the query in the request.
  &quot;searchConfig&quot;: { # Configuration specific to search queries with data stores. # Optional. Configuration specific to search queries with data stores.
    &quot;boostSpecs&quot;: [ # Optional. Boost specifications for data stores.
      { # Boost specifications for data stores.
        &quot;dataStores&quot;: [ # Optional. Data Stores where the boosting configuration is applied. The full names of the referenced data stores. Formats: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection}/dataStores/{data_store}` `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/dataStores/{data_store}`
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;spec&quot;: [ # Optional. A list of boosting specifications.

            &quot;conditionBoostSpecs&quot;: [ # Optional. Condition boost specifications. If a document matches multiple conditions in the specifictions, boost scores from these specifications are all applied and combined in a non-linear way. Maximum number of specifications is 20.
              { # Boost applies to documents which match a condition.
                &quot;boost&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Strength of the condition boost, which should be in [-1, 1]. Negative boost means demotion. Default is 0.0. Setting to 1.0 gives the document a big promotion. However, it does not necessarily mean that the boosted document will be the top result at all times, nor that other documents will be excluded. Results could still be shown even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your heavily favored but irrelevant documents. Setting to -1.0 gives the document a big demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant might still be shown. The document will have an upstream battle to get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely. Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored.
                &quot;boostControlSpec&quot;: { # Specification for custom ranking based on customer specified attribute value.

                  &quot;attributeType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The attribute type to be used to determine the boost amount. The attribute value can be derived from the field value of the specified field_name. In the case of numerical it is straightforward i.e. attribute_value = numerical_field_value. In the case of freshness however, attribute_value = (time.now() - datetime_field_value).
                  &quot;controlPoints&quot;: [ # Optional. The control points used to define the curve. The monotonic function (defined through the interpolation_type above) passes through the control points listed here.
                    { # The control points used to define the curve. The curve defined through these control points can only be monotonically increasing or decreasing(constant values are acceptable).
                      &quot;attributeValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Can be one of: 1. The numerical field value. 2. The duration spec for freshness: The value must be formatted as an XSD `dayTimeDuration` value (a restricted subset of an ISO 8601 duration value). The pattern for this is: `nDnM]`.
                      &quot;boostAmount&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. The value between -1 to 1 by which to boost the score if the attribute_value evaluates to the value specified above.
                    },
                  ],
                  &quot;fieldName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the field whose value will be used to determine the boost amount.
                  &quot;interpolationType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The interpolation type to be applied to connect the control points listed below.
                },
                &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An expression which specifies a boost condition. The syntax and supported fields are the same as a filter expression. Examples: * To boost documents with document ID &quot;doc_1&quot; or &quot;doc_2&quot;, and color &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;Blue&quot;: * (id: ANY(&quot;doc_1&quot;, &quot;doc_2&quot;)) AND (color: ANY(&quot;Red&quot;,&quot;Blue&quot;))

  },
  &quot;sessionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The ID of the search session. The session_id can be combined with Dialogflow V3 Agent ID retrieved from conversation profile or on its own to identify a search session. The search history of the same session will impact the search result. It&#x27;s up to the API caller to choose an appropriate `Session ID`. It can be a random number or some type of session identifiers (preferably hashed). The length must not exceed 36 characters.
