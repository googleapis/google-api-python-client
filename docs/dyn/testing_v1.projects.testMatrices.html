<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="cancel">cancel(projectId, testMatrixId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Cancels unfinished test executions in a test matrix.
This call returns immediately and cancellation proceeds asychronously.
If the matrix is already final, this operation will have no effect.

May return any of the following canonical error codes:

- PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to read project
- INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed
- NOT_FOUND - if the Test Matrix does not exist

Args:
  projectId: string, Cloud project that owns the test. (required)
  testMatrixId: string, Test matrix that will be canceled. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response containing the current state of the specified test matrix.
    &quot;testState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The current rolled-up state of the test matrix.
        # If this state is already final, then the cancelation request will
        # have no effect.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(projectId, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates and runs a matrix of tests according to the given specifications.
Unsupported environments will be returned in the state UNSUPPORTED.
Matrices are limited to at most 200 supported executions.

May return any of the following canonical error codes:

- PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to write to project
- INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed or if the matrix expands
                     to more than 200 supported executions
