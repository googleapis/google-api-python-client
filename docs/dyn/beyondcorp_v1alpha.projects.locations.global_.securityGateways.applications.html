  <pre>Creates a new Application in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the parent SecurityGateway using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/securityGateways/{security_gateway_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Beyondcorp Application resource information.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An arbitrary user-provided name for the Application resource. Cannot exceed 64 characters.
  &quot;endpointMatchers&quot;: [ # Required. Endpoint matchers associated with an application. A combination of hostname and ports as endpoint matcher is used to match the application. Match conditions for OR logic. An array of match conditions to allow for multiple matching criteria. The rule is considered a match if one the conditions are met. The conditions can be one of the following combination (Hostname), (Hostname &amp; Ports) EXAMPLES: Hostname - (&quot;*.abc.com&quot;), (&quot;xyz.abc.com&quot;) Hostname and Ports - (&quot;abc.com&quot; and &quot;22&quot;), (&quot;abc.com&quot; and &quot;22,33&quot;) etc
    { # EndpointMatcher contains the information of the endpoint that will match the application.
      &quot;hostname&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Hostname of the application.
      &quot;ports&quot;: [ # Optional. Ports of the application.
        42,
      ],
    },
  ],
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. Name of the resource.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the resource was last modified.
}

  applicationId: string, Optional. User-settable Application resource ID. * Must start with a letter. * Must contain between 4-63 characters from `/a-z-/`. * Must end with a number or letter.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
}</pre>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body=None, requestId=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the parameters of a single Application.

Args:
  name: string, Identifier. Name of the resource. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Beyondcorp Application resource information.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An arbitrary user-provided name for the Application resource. Cannot exceed 64 characters.

  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the resource was last modified.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request timed out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Mutable fields include: display_name.
