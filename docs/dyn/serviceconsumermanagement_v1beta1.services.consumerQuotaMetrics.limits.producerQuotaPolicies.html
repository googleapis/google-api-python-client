  <pre>Creates a producer quota policy. A producer quota policy is applied by the owner or administrator of a service at an org or folder node to set the default quota limit for all consumers under the node where the policy is created. To create multiple policies at once, use ImportProducerQuotaPolicies instead. If a policy with the specified dimensions already exists, this call will fail. To overwrite an existing policy if one is already present (&quot;upsert&quot; semantics), use ImportProducerQuotaPolicies instead.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the parent quota limit. An example name would be: `services/compute.googleapis.com/organizations/123/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Quota policy created by service producer.
  &quot;container&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The cloud resource container at which the quota policy is created. The format is {container_type}/{container_number}
  &quot;dimensions&quot;: { #  If this map is nonempty, then this policy applies only to specific values for dimensions defined in the limit unit. For example, a policy on a limit with the unit 1/{project}/{region} could contain an entry with the key &quot;region&quot; and the value &quot;us-east-1&quot;; the policy is only applied to quota consumed in that region. This map has the following restrictions: * Keys that are not defined in the limit&#x27;s unit are not valid keys. Any string appearing in {brackets} in the unit (besides {project} or {user}) is a defined key. * &quot;project&quot; is not a valid key; the project is already specified in the parent resource name. * &quot;user&quot; is not a valid key; the API does not support quota polcies that apply only to a specific user. * If &quot;region&quot; appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud region. * If &quot;zone&quot; appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud zone. * If any valid key other than &quot;region&quot; or &quot;zone&quot; appears in the map, then all valid keys other than &quot;region&quot; or &quot;zone&quot; must also appear in the map.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;metric&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the metric to which this policy applies. An example name would be: `compute.googleapis.com/cpus`
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the producer policy. An example name would be: `services/compute.googleapis.com/organizations/123/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion/producerQuotaPolicies/4a3f2c1d`
  &quot;policyValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The quota policy value. Can be any nonnegative integer, or -1 (unlimited quota).
  &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The limit unit of the limit to which this policy applies. An example unit would be: `1/{project}/{region}` Note that `{project}` and `{region}` are not placeholders in this example; the literal characters `{` and `}` occur in the string.
}

  force: boolean, Whether to force the creation of the quota policy. If the policy creation would decrease the default limit of any consumer tier by more than 10 percent, the call is rejected, as a safety measure to avoid accidentally decreasing quota too quickly. Setting the force parameter to true ignores this restriction.
  forceJustification: string, If force option is set to true, force_justification is suggested to be set to log the reason in audit logs.
  validateOnly: boolean, If set to true, validate the request, but do not actually update.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
