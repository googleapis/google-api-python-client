</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(location, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new function. If a function with the given name already exists in the specified project, the long running operation will return `ALREADY_EXISTS` error.

Args:
  location: string, Required. The project and location in which the function should be created, specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a Cloud Function that contains user computation executed in response to an event. It encapsulate function and triggers configurations.
  &quot;availableMemoryMb&quot;: 42, # The amount of memory in MB available for a function. Defaults to 256MB.
  &quot;buildEnvironmentVariables&quot;: { # Build environment variables that shall be available during build time.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;buildId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The Cloud Build ID of the latest successful deployment of the function.
  &quot;buildWorkerPool&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the Cloud Build Custom Worker Pool that should be used to build the function. The format of this field is `projects/{project}/locations/{region}/workerPools/{workerPool}` where {project} and {region} are the project id and region respectively where the worker pool is defined and {workerPool} is the short name of the worker pool. If the project id is not the same as the function, then the Cloud Functions Service Agent (service-@gcf-admin-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must be granted the role Cloud Build Custom Workers Builder (roles/cloudbuild.customworkers.builder) in the project.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User-provided description of a function.
  &quot;entryPoint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the function (as defined in source code) that will be executed. Defaults to the resource name suffix, if not specified. For backward compatibility, if function with given name is not found, then the system will try to use function named &quot;function&quot;. For Node.js this is name of a function exported by the module specified in `source_location`.
  &quot;environmentVariables&quot;: { # Environment variables that shall be available during function execution.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;eventTrigger&quot;: { # Describes EventTrigger, used to request events be sent from another service. # A source that fires events in response to a condition in another service.
    &quot;eventType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The type of event to observe. For example: `providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change` and `providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish`. Event types match pattern `providers/*/eventTypes/*.*`. The pattern contains: 1. namespace: For example, `cloud.storage` and `google.firebase.analytics`. 2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type `object`. 3. action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for a Google Cloud Storage Object is &#x27;change&#x27;. These parts are lower case.
    &quot;failurePolicy&quot;: { # Describes the policy in case of function&#x27;s execution failure. If empty, then defaults to ignoring failures (i.e. not retrying them). # Specifies policy for failed executions.
      &quot;retry&quot;: { # Describes the retry policy in case of function&#x27;s execution failure. A function execution will be retried on any failure. A failed execution will be retried up to 7 days with an exponential backoff (capped at 10 seconds). Retried execution is charged as any other execution. # If specified, then the function will be retried in case of a failure.
      },
    },
    &quot;resource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for example, `projects/_/buckets/myBucket`. Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For example: 1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the same project as the `CloudFunction`. 2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an `event_type` of &quot;google.pubsub.topic.publish&quot; should have a resource that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics. Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized &quot;long&quot; format. See each *service&#x27;s* documentation for supported formats.
    &quot;service&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The hostname of the service that should be observed. If no string is provided, the default service implementing the API will be used. For example, `storage.googleapis.com` is the default for all event types in the `google.storage` namespace.
  },
  &quot;httpsTrigger&quot;: { # Describes HttpsTrigger, could be used to connect web hooks to function. # An HTTPS endpoint type of source that can be triggered via URL.

  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Labels associated with this Cloud Function.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;maxInstances&quot;: 42, # The limit on the maximum number of function instances that may coexist at a given time. In some cases, such as rapid traffic surges, Cloud Functions may, for a short period of time, create more instances than the specified max instances limit. If your function cannot tolerate this temporary behavior, you may want to factor in a safety margin and set a lower max instances value than your function can tolerate. See the [Max Instances](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/max-instances) Guide for more details.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A user-defined name of the function. Function names must be unique globally and match pattern `projects/*/locations/*/functions/*`
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The VPC Network that this cloud function can connect to. It can be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name of the network resource. If the short network name is used, the network must belong to the same project. Otherwise, it must belong to a project within the same organization. The format of this field is either `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}` or `{network}`, where {project} is a project id where the network is defined, and {network} is the short name of the network. This field is mutually exclusive with `vpc_connector` and will be replaced by it. See [the VPC documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc) for more information on connecting Cloud projects.
  &quot;runtime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The runtime in which to run the function. Required when deploying a new function, optional when updating an existing function. For a complete list of possible choices, see the [`gcloud` command reference](/sdk/gcloud/reference/functions/deploy#--runtime).
  &quot;serviceAccountEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The email of the function&#x27;s service account. If empty, defaults to `{project_id}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.
  &quot;sourceArchiveUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Google Cloud Storage URL, starting with gs://, pointing to the zip archive which contains the function.
  &quot;sourceRepository&quot;: { # Describes SourceRepository, used to represent parameters related to source repository where a function is hosted. # **Beta Feature** The source repository where a function is hosted.
    &quot;deployedUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The URL pointing to the hosted repository where the function were defined at the time of deployment. It always points to a specific commit in the format described above.
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL pointing to the hosted repository where the function is defined. There are supported Cloud Source Repository URLs in the following formats: To refer to a specific commit: `https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/revisions/*/paths/*` To refer to a moveable alias (branch): `https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/moveable-aliases/*/paths/*` In particular, to refer to HEAD use `master` moveable alias. To refer to a specific fixed alias (tag): `https://source.developers.google.com/projects/*/repos/*/fixed-aliases/*/paths/*` You may omit `paths/*` if you want to use the main directory.
  },
  &quot;sourceToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Input only. An identifier for Firebase function sources. Disclaimer: This field is only supported for Firebase function deployments.
  &quot;sourceUploadUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Google Cloud Storage signed URL used for source uploading, generated by google.cloud.functions.v1.GenerateUploadUrl

  &quot;versionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The version identifier of the Cloud Function. Each deployment attempt results in a new version of a function being created.
  &quot;vpcConnector&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to. It can be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name of the network connector resource. The format of this field is `projects/*/locations/*/connectors/*` This field is mutually exclusive with `network` field and will eventually replace it.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a Cloud Function that contains user computation executed in response to an event. It encapsulate function and triggers configurations.
  &quot;availableMemoryMb&quot;: 42, # The amount of memory in MB available for a function. Defaults to 256MB.

  },
  &quot;buildId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The Cloud Build ID of the latest successful deployment of the function.
  &quot;buildWorkerPool&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the Cloud Build Custom Worker Pool that should be used to build the function. The format of this field is `projects/{project}/locations/{region}/workerPools/{workerPool}` where {project} and {region} are the project id and region respectively where the worker pool is defined and {workerPool} is the short name of the worker pool. If the project id is not the same as the function, then the Cloud Functions Service Agent (service-@gcf-admin-robot.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must be granted the role Cloud Build Custom Workers Builder (roles/cloudbuild.customworkers.builder) in the project.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User-provided description of a function.
  &quot;entryPoint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the function (as defined in source code) that will be executed. Defaults to the resource name suffix, if not specified. For backward compatibility, if function with given name is not found, then the system will try to use function named &quot;function&quot;. For Node.js this is name of a function exported by the module specified in `source_location`.
  &quot;environmentVariables&quot;: { # Environment variables that shall be available during function execution.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;eventTrigger&quot;: { # Describes EventTrigger, used to request events be sent from another service. # A source that fires events in response to a condition in another service.
    &quot;eventType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The type of event to observe. For example: `providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change` and `providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish`. Event types match pattern `providers/*/eventTypes/*.*`. The pattern contains: 1. namespace: For example, `cloud.storage` and `google.firebase.analytics`. 2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type `object`. 3. action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for a Google Cloud Storage Object is &#x27;change&#x27;. These parts are lower case.
    &quot;failurePolicy&quot;: { # Describes the policy in case of function&#x27;s execution failure. If empty, then defaults to ignoring failures (i.e. not retrying them). # Specifies policy for failed executions.
      &quot;retry&quot;: { # Describes the retry policy in case of function&#x27;s execution failure. A function execution will be retried on any failure. A failed execution will be retried up to 7 days with an exponential backoff (capped at 10 seconds).

    &quot;resource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for example, `projects/_/buckets/myBucket`. Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For example: 1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the same project as the `CloudFunction`. 2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an `event_type` of &quot;google.pubsub.topic.publish&quot; should have a resource that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics. Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized &quot;long&quot; format. See each *service&#x27;s* documentation for supported formats.
    &quot;service&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The hostname of the service that should be observed. If no string is provided, the default service implementing the API will be used. For example, `storage.googleapis.com` is the default for all event types in the `google.storage` namespace.

  },
  &quot;maxInstances&quot;: 42, # The limit on the maximum number of function instances that may coexist at a given time. In some cases, such as rapid traffic surges, Cloud Functions may, for a short period of time, create more instances than the specified max instances limit. If your function cannot tolerate this temporary behavior, you may want to factor in a safety margin and set a lower max instances value than your function can tolerate. See the [Max Instances](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/max-instances) Guide for more details.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A user-defined name of the function. Function names must be unique globally and match pattern `projects/*/locations/*/functions/*`
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The VPC Network that this cloud function can connect to. It can be either the fully-qualified URI, or the short name of the network resource. If the short network name is used, the network must belong to the same project. Otherwise, it must belong to a project within the same organization. The format of this field is either `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}` or `{network}`, where {project} is a project id where the network is defined, and {network} is the short name of the network.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`.

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

    { # Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
