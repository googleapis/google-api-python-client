<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="call">call(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Synchronously invokes a deployed Cloud Function. To be used for testing
purposes as very limited traffic is allowed. For more information on
the actual limits, refer to
[Rate Limits](https://cloud.google.com/functions/quotas#rate_limits).

Args:
  name: string, The name of the function to be called. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `CallFunction` method.
    "data": "A String", # Input to be passed to the function.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response of `CallFunction` method.
    "executionId": "A String", # Execution id of function invocation.
    "result": "A String", # Result populated for successful execution of synchronous function. Will
        # not be populated if function does not return a result through context.
    "error": "A String", # Either system or user-function generated error. Set if execution
        # was not successful.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(location, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new function. If a function with the given name already exists in
the specified project, the long running operation will return
`ALREADY_EXISTS` error.

Args:
  location: string, The project and location in which the function should be created, specified
in the format `projects/*/locations/*` (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a Cloud Function that contains user computation executed in
      # response to an event. It encapsulate function and triggers configurations.
      # LINT.IfChange
    "status": "A String", # Output only. Status of the function deployment.
    "eventTrigger": { # Describes EventTrigger, used to request events be sent from another # A source that fires events in response to a condition in another service.
        # service.
      "eventType": "A String", # Required. The type of event to observe. For example:
          # `providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change` and
          # `providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish`.
          #
          # Event types match pattern `providers/*/eventTypes/*.*`.
          # The pattern contains:
          #
          # 1. namespace: For example, `cloud.storage` and
          #    `google.firebase.analytics`.
          # 2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For
          #    example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type `object`.
          # 3. action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for
          #    a Google Cloud Storage Object is 'change'.
          # These parts are lower case.

          # example:
          #
          # 1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions
          #    only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the
          #    same project as the `CloudFunction`.
          # 2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an
          #    `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an
          #    `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource
          #    that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.
          #
          # Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an
          # `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized "long"

  <pre>Returns a signed URL for uploading a function source code.
For more information about the signed URL usage see:
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls.
Once the function source code upload is complete, the used signed
URL should be provided in CreateFunction or UpdateFunction request
as a reference to the function source code.

When uploading source code to the generated signed URL, please follow
these restrictions:

* Source file type should be a zip file.
* Source file size should not exceed 100MB limit.
* No credentials should be attached - the signed URLs provide access to the
  target bucket using internal service identity; if credentials were
  attached, the identity from the credentials would be used, but that
  identity does not have permissions to upload files to the URL.

When making a HTTP PUT request, these two headers need to be specified:

* `content-type: application/zip`
* `x-goog-content-length-range: 0,104857600`

And this header SHOULD NOT be specified:

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

    },
    "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
        # message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
          # message types for APIs to use.

        },
      ],
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
