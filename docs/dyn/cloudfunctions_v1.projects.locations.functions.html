in the format `projects/*/locations/*` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

          # `providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish`.
          #
          # Event types match pattern `providers/*/eventTypes/*.*`.

          # 2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an
          #    `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an
          #    `event_type` of &quot;google.pubsub.topic.publish&quot; should have a resource
          #    that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.
          #
          # Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an
          # `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized &quot;long&quot;

Once the function source code upload is complete, the used signed
URL should be provided in CreateFunction or UpdateFunction request
as a reference to the function source code.

When uploading source code to the generated signed URL, please follow
these restrictions:

* Source file type should be a zip file.
* Source file size should not exceed 100MB limit.
* No credentials should be attached - the signed URLs provide access to the
  target bucket using internal service identity; if credentials were
  attached, the identity from the credentials would be used, but that
  identity does not have permissions to upload files to the URL.

When making a HTTP PUT request, these two headers need to be specified:

      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version

        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

  <pre>Returns a list of functions that belong to the requested project.

Args:
  parent: string, The project and location from which the function should be listed,
specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*`
If you want to list functions in all locations, use &quot;-&quot; in place of a
location. When listing functions in all locations, if one or more
location(s) are unreachable, the response will contain functions from all
reachable locations along with the names of any unreachable locations. (required)
  pageToken: string, The value returned by the last
`ListFunctionsResponse`; indicates that
this is a continuation of a prior `ListFunctions` call, and that the
system should return the next page of data.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of functions to return per call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Tests the specified permissions against the IAM access control policy
for a function.
If the function does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
