<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="call">call(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Synchronously invokes a deployed Cloud Function. To be used for testing
purposes as very limited traffic is allowed. For more information on
the actual limits, refer to
[Rate Limits](https://cloud.google.com/functions/quotas#rate_limits).

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the function to be called. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `CallFunction` method.
    "data": "A String", # Required. Input to be passed to the function.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response of `CallFunction` method.
    "executionId": "A String", # Execution id of function invocation.
    "result": "A String", # Result populated for successful execution of synchronous function. Will
        # not be populated if function does not return a result through context.
    "error": "A String", # Either system or user-function generated error. Set if execution
        # was not successful.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(location, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new function. If a function with the given name already exists in
the specified project, the long running operation will return
`ALREADY_EXISTS` error.

Args:
  location: string, Required. The project and location in which the function should be created, specified
in the format `projects/*/locations/*` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a Cloud Function that contains user computation executed in
      # response to an event. It encapsulate function and triggers configurations.
    "eventTrigger": { # Describes EventTrigger, used to request events be sent from another # A source that fires events in response to a condition in another service.
        # service.
      "failurePolicy": { # Describes the policy in case of function's execution failure. # Specifies policy for failed executions.
          # If empty, then defaults to ignoring failures (i.e. not retrying them).
        "retry": { # Describes the retry policy in case of function's execution failure. # If specified, then the function will be retried in case of a failure.
            # A function execution will be retried on any failure.
            # A failed execution will be retried up to 7 days with an exponential backoff
            # (capped at 10 seconds).

          # example:
          #
          # 1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions
          #    only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the
          #    same project as the `CloudFunction`.
          # 2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an
          #    `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an
          #    `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource
          #    that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.

          #    `google.firebase.analytics`.
          # 2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For

https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls.
Once the function source code upload is complete, the used signed

When uploading source code to the generated signed URL, please follow
these restrictions:

* No credentials should be attached - the signed URLs provide access to the
  target bucket using internal service identity; if credentials were
  attached, the identity from the credentials would be used, but that
  identity does not have permissions to upload files to the URL.

When making a HTTP PUT request, these two headers need to be specified:

* `content-type: application/zip`
* `x-goog-content-length-range: 0,104857600`

        # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.

      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the

        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    "version": 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.
        #
        # Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value
        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Tests the specified permissions against the IAM access control policy
for a function.
If the function does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
  }</pre>
