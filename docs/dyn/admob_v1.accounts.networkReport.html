  <pre>Generates an AdMob Network report based on the provided report specification. Returns result of a server-side streaming RPC. The result is returned in a sequence of responses.

Args:
  parent: string, Resource name of the account to generate the report for. Example: accounts/pub-9876543210987654 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
