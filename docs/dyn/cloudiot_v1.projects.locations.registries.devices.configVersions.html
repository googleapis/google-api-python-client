<p class="firstline">Lists the last few versions of the device configuration in descending</p>
<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(name, numVersions=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the last few versions of the device configuration in descending
order (i.e.: newest first).

Args:
  name: string, The name of the device. For example,
`projects/p0/locations/us-central1/registries/registry0/devices/device0` or
`projects/p0/locations/us-central1/registries/registry0/devices/{num_id}`. (required)
  numVersions: integer, The number of versions to list. Versions are listed in decreasing order of
the version number. The maximum number of versions retained is 10. If this
value is zero, it will return all the versions available.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response for `ListDeviceConfigVersions`.
    "deviceConfigs": [ # The device configuration for the last few versions. Versions are listed
        # in decreasing order, starting from the most recent one.
      { # The device configuration. Eventually delivered to devices.
        "version": "A String", # [Output only] The version of this update. The version number is assigned by
            # the server, and is always greater than 0 after device creation. The
            # version must be 0 on the `CreateDevice` request if a `config` is
            # specified; the response of `CreateDevice` will always have a value of 1.
        "cloudUpdateTime": "A String", # [Output only] The time at which this configuration version was updated in
            # Cloud IoT Core. This timestamp is set by the server.
        "binaryData": "A String", # The device configuration data.
        "deviceAckTime": "A String", # [Output only] The time at which Cloud IoT Core received the
            # acknowledgment from the device, indicating that the device has received
            # this configuration version. If this field is not present, the device has
            # not yet acknowledged that it received this version. Note that when
            # the config was sent to the device, many config versions may have been
            # available in Cloud IoT Core while the device was disconnected, and on
            # connection, only the latest version is sent to the device. Some
            # versions may never be sent to the device, and therefore are never
            # acknowledged. This timestamp is set by Cloud IoT Core.
