Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of reseller account in which to create the customer. Parent uses the format: accounts/{account_id} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Entity representing a customer of a reseller or distributor.
  &quot;alternateEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Secondary contact email. You need to provide an alternate email to create different domains if a primary contact email already exists. Users will receive a notification with credentials when you create an admin.google.com account. Secondary emails are also recovery email addresses. Alternate emails are optional when you create Team customers.
  &quot;channelPartnerId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Cloud Identity ID of the customer&#x27;s channel partner. Populated only if a channel partner exists for this customer.
  &quot;cloudIdentityId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The customer&#x27;s Cloud Identity ID if the customer has a Cloud Identity resource.
  &quot;cloudIdentityInfo&quot;: { # Cloud Identity information for the Cloud Channel Customer. # Output only. Cloud Identity information for the customer. Populated only if a Cloud Identity account exists for this customer.
    &quot;adminConsoleUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. URI of Customer&#x27;s Admin console dashboard.
    &quot;alternateEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The alternate email.
    &quot;customerType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # CustomerType indicates verification type needed for using services.
    &quot;eduData&quot;: { # Required Edu Attributes # Edu information about the customer.
      &quot;instituteSize&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Size of the institute.
      &quot;instituteType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Designated institute type of customer.
      &quot;website&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Web address for the edu customer&#x27;s institution.
    },
    &quot;isDomainVerified&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Whether the domain is verified. This field is not returned for a Customer&#x27;s cloud_identity_info resource. Partners can use the domains.get() method of the Workspace SDK&#x27;s Directory API, or listen to the PRIMARY_DOMAIN_VERIFIED Pub/Sub event in to track domain verification of their resolve Workspace customers.
    &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Language code.
    &quot;phoneNumber&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Phone number associated with the Cloud Identity.
    &quot;primaryDomain&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The primary domain name.
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the customer was created.
  &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The customer&#x27;s primary domain. Must match the primary contact email&#x27;s domain.
  &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The BCP-47 language code, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Resource name of the customer. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id}
  &quot;orgDisplayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Name of the organization that the customer entity represents.
  &quot;orgPostalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Required. The organization address for the customer. To enforce US laws and embargoes, we require a region and zip code. You must provide valid addresses for every customer. To set the customer&#x27;s language, use the Customer-level language code.
    &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
    &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
    &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
    &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
    &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
    &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
    &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
    &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
    &quot;sublocality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.
  },
  &quot;primaryContactInfo&quot;: { # Contact information for a customer account. # Primary contact info.
    &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The customer account contact&#x27;s display name, formatted as a combination of the customer&#x27;s first and last name.
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The customer account&#x27;s contact email. Required for entitlements that create admin.google.com accounts, and serves as the customer&#x27;s username for those accounts. Use this email to invite Team customers.
    &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The customer account contact&#x27;s first name. Optional for Team customers.
    &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The customer account contact&#x27;s last name. Optional for Team customers.
    &quot;phone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The customer account&#x27;s contact phone number.
    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The customer account contact&#x27;s job title.
  },
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when the customer was updated.

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Required. The organization address for the customer.

    &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.

      },

      &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The customer&#x27;s primary domain. Must match the primary contact email&#x27;s domain.
      &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The BCP-47 language code, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Resource name of the customer. Format: accounts/{account_id}/customers/{customer_id}
      &quot;orgDisplayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Name of the organization that the customer entity represents.
      &quot;orgPostalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Required. The organization address for the customer. To enforce US laws and embargoes, we require a region and zip code. You must provide valid addresses for every customer. To set the customer&#x27;s language, use the Customer-level language code.
        &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
        &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
        &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
        &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
        &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
        &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

        ],
        &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
        &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
        &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
        &quot;sublocality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.

Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear.

It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
    &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.

    &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
    &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.

See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
    &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
    &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).

  &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. You can specify an optional unique request ID, and if you need to retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it&#x27;s complete. For example, you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if it received the original operation with the same request ID. If it did, it will ignore the second request. The request ID must be a valid [UUID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`).

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
