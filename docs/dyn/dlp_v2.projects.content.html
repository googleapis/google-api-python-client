If `number_to_mask` is negative, this denotes inverse masking. Cloud DLP masks all but a number of characters. For example, suppose you have the following values: - `masking_character` is `*` - `number_to_mask` is `-4` - `reverse_order` is `false` - `CharsToIgnore` includes `-` - Input string is `1234-5678-9012-3456` The resulting de-identified string is `****-****-****-3456`. Cloud DLP masks all but the last four characters. If `reverse_order` is `true`, all but the first four characters are masked as `1234-****-****-****`.
                &quot;reverseOrder&quot;: True or False, # Mask characters in reverse order. For example, if `masking_character` is `0`, `number_to_mask` is `14`, and `reverse_order` is `false`, then the input string `1234-5678-9012-3456` is masked as `00000000000000-3456`. If `masking_character` is `*`, `number_to_mask` is `3`, and `reverse_order` is `true`, then the string `12345` is masked as `12***`.

When no InfoTypes or CustomInfoTypes are specified in this request, the system will automatically choose what detectors to run. By default this may be all types, but may change over time as detectors are updated. For how to guides, see https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/inspecting-images and https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/inspecting-text,

This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE.

This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate For example, if the name of custom infoType is &#x27;MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE&#x27; and the surrogate is &#x27;abc&#x27;, the full replacement value will be: &#x27;MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc&#x27; This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype). This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data.

The following scheme defines the format: info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate For example, if the name of custom infoType is &#x27;MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE&#x27; and the surrogate is &#x27;abc&#x27;, the full replacement value will be: &#x27;MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc&#x27; This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype). This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

Either a name of your choosing when creating a CustomInfoType, or one of the names listed at https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference when specifying a built-in type. When sending Cloud DLP results to Data Catalog, infoType names should conform to the pattern `[A-Za-z0-9$_-]{1,64}`.
