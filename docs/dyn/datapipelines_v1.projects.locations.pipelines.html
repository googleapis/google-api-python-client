Args:
  parent: string, Required. The location name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The main pipeline entity and all the necessary metadata for launching and managing linked jobs.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. The timestamp when the pipeline was initially created. Set by the Data Pipelines service.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The display name of the pipeline. It can contain only letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
  &quot;jobCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. Number of jobs.
  &quot;lastUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. The timestamp when the pipeline was last modified. Set by the Data Pipelines service.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The pipeline name.

The list of available locations can be obtained by calling `google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations`. Note that the Data Pipelines service is not available in all regions.
