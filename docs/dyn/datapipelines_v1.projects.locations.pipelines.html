  <pre>Creates a pipeline. For a batch pipeline, you can pass scheduler information. Data Pipelines uses the scheduler information to create an internal scheduler that runs jobs periodically. If the internal scheduler is not configured, you can use RunPipeline to run jobs.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The location name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The main pipeline entity and all the necessary metadata for launching and managing linked jobs.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. The timestamp when the pipeline was initially created. Set by the Data Pipelines service.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The display name of the pipeline. It can contain only letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
  &quot;jobCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. Number of jobs.
  &quot;lastUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Immutable. The timestamp when the pipeline was last modified. Set by the Data Pipelines service.

The list of available locations can be obtained by calling `google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations`. Note that the Data Pipelines service is not available in all regions.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a pipeline. If a scheduler job is attached to the pipeline, it will be deleted.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The pipeline name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/pipelines/PIPELINE_ID`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method.
