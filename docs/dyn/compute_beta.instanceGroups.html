<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addInstances">addInstances(project, zone, instanceGroup, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds a list of instances to the specified instance group. All of the instances in the instance group must be in the same network/subnetwork. Read  Adding instances for more information.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the instance group is located. (required)
  instanceGroup: string, The name of the instance group where you are adding instances. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;instances&quot;: [ # The list of instances to add to the instance group.
    {
      &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL for a specific instance.
    },
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, filter=None, includeAllScopes=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of instance groups and sorts them by zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  includeAllScopes: boolean, Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.
  &quot;items&quot;: { # A list of InstanceGroupsScopedList resources.

              #
              # This allows the system to reference ports by the assigned name instead of a port number. Named ports can also contain multiple ports. For example: [{name: &quot;http&quot;, port: 80},{name: &quot;http&quot;, port: 8080}]
              #
              # Named ports apply to all instances in this instance group.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of zonal instance group resources contained within the specified zone.

For managed instance groups, use the instanceGroupManagers or regionInstanceGroupManagers methods instead.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the instance group is located. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

Returns:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="listInstances">listInstances(project, zone, instanceGroup, body=None, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the instances in the specified instance group. The orderBy query parameter is not supported.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the instance group is located. (required)
  instanceGroup: string, The name of the instance group from which you want to generate a list of included instances. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;instanceState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A filter for the state of the instances in the instance group. Valid options are ALL or RUNNING. If you do not specify this parameter the list includes all instances regardless of their state.
}

  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server.
  &quot;items&quot;: [ # A list of InstanceWithNamedPorts resources.
    {
      &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the instance.
      &quot;namedPorts&quot;: [ # [Output Only] The named ports that belong to this instance group.
        { # The named port. For example: .
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name for this named port. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
          &quot;port&quot;: 42, # The port number, which can be a value between 1 and 65535.
        },
      ],
      &quot;status&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The status of the instance.
    },
  ],
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#instanceGroupsListInstances&quot;, # [Output Only] The resource type, which is always compute#instanceGroupsListInstances for the list of instances in the specified instance group.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource.
  &quot;warning&quot;: { # [Output Only] Informational warning message.
    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A warning code, if applicable. For example, Compute Engine returns NO_RESULTS_ON_PAGE if there are no results in the response.
    &quot;data&quot;: [ # [Output Only] Metadata about this warning in key: value format. For example:
        # &quot;data&quot;: [ { &quot;key&quot;: &quot;scope&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;zones/us-east1-d&quot; }
      {
        &quot;key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding).
        &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A warning data value corresponding to the key.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A human-readable description of the warning code.
  },

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="removeInstances">removeInstances(project, zone, instanceGroup, body=None, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Removes one or more instances from the specified instance group, but does not delete those instances.

If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the instance group is located. (required)
  instanceGroup: string, The name of the instance group where the specified instances will be removed. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;instances&quot;: [ # The list of instances to remove from the instance group.
    {
      &quot;instance&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL for a specific instance.
    },
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
