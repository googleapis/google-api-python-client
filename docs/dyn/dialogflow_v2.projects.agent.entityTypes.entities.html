<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchCreate">batchCreate(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates multiple new entities in the specified entity type. Operation 

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the entity type to create entities in. Format: `projects//agent/entityTypes/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for EntityTypes.BatchCreateEntities.
  &quot;entities&quot;: [ # Required. The entities to create.
    { # An **entity entry** for an associated entity type.
      &quot;synonyms&quot;: [ # Required. A collection of value synonyms. For example, if the entity type is *vegetable*, and `value` is *scallions*, a synonym could be *green onions*. For `KIND_LIST` entity types: * This collection must contain exactly one synonym equal to `value`.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The primary value associated with this entity entry. For example, if the entity type is *vegetable*, the value could be *scallions*. For `KIND_MAP` entity types: * A reference value to be used in place of synonyms. For `KIND_LIST` entity types: * A string that can contain references to other entity types (with or without aliases).
