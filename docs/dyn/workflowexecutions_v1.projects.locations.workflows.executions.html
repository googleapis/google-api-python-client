  parent: string, Required. Name of the workflow for which the executions should be listed. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workflows/{workflow} (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Filters applied to the `[Executions.ListExecutions]` results. The following fields are supported for filtering: `executionId`, `state`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `duration`, `workflowRevisionId`, `stepName`, and `label`. For details, see AIP-160. For example, if you are using the Google APIs Explorer: `state=&quot;SUCCEEDED&quot;` or `startTime&gt;&quot;2023-08-01&quot; AND state=&quot;FAILED&quot;`
  orderBy: string, Optional. Comma-separated list of fields that specify the ordering applied to the `[Executions.ListExecutions]` results. By default the ordering is based on descending `startTime`. The following fields are supported for ordering: `executionId`, `state`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `duration`, and `workflowRevisionId`. For details, see AIP-132.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of executions to return per call. Max supported value depends on the selected Execution view: it&#x27;s 1000 for BASIC and 100 for FULL. The default value used if the field is not specified is 100, regardless of the selected view. Values greater than the max value will be coerced down to it.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListExecutions` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListExecutions` must match the call that provided the page token. Note that pagination is applied to dynamic data. The list of executions returned can change between page requests.
  view: string, Optional. A view defining which fields should be filled in the returned executions. The API will default to the BASIC view.
    Allowed values
      EXECUTION_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - The default / unset value.
      BASIC - Includes only basic metadata about the execution. The following fields are returned: name, start_time, end_time, duration, state, and workflow_revision_id.
      FULL - Includes all data.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
