<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists accounts accessible to the calling user and matching the constraints of the request such as page size or filters. This is not just listing the sub-accounts of an MCA, but all accounts the calling user has access to including other MCAs, linked accounts, standalone accounts and so on. If no filter is provided, then it returns all the accounts the user has access to. This method is eventually consistent, meaning changes such as creating, updating an account or a change of relationships between accounts may not show up in the results immediately. Instead, these changes propagate over a short period, after which the updated information can match the associated predicates. That means, that searching by account name might not return a recently changed account even though it satisfies the predicate.

Args:
  filter: string, Optional. Returns only accounts that match the [filter](https://developers.google.com/merchant/api/guides/accounts/filter). For more details, see the [filter syntax reference](https://developers.google.com/merchant/api/guides/accounts/filter-syntax).
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of accounts to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 250 accounts are returned. The maximum value is 500; values above 500 are coerced to 500.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListAccounts` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListAccounts` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Accounts can operate as standalone entities or be part of a multi-client account (MCA) structure. In an MCA setup the parent account manages multiple sub-accounts. Establishing an account involves configuring attributes like the account name, time zone, and language preferences.
