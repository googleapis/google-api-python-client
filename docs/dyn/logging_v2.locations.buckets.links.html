  <pre>Asynchronously creates a linked dataset in BigQuery which makes it possible to use BigQuery to read the logs stored in the log bucket. A log bucket may currently only contain one link.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The full resource name of the bucket to create a link for. &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]&quot; &quot;organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]&quot; &quot;billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]&quot; &quot;folders/[FOLDER_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]&quot;  (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a link connected to an analytics enabled bucket.
  &quot;bigqueryDataset&quot;: { # Describes a BigQuery dataset that was created by a link. # Optional. The information of a BigQuery Dataset. When a link is created, a BigQuery dataset is created along with it, in the same project as the LogBucket it&#x27;s linked to. This dataset will also have BigQuery Views corresponding to the LogViews in the bucket.
    &quot;datasetId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The full resource name of the BigQuery dataset. The DATASET_ID will match the ID of the link, so the link must match the naming restrictions of BigQuery datasets (alphanumeric characters and underscores only).The dataset will have a resource path of &quot;bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_ID/datasets/DATASET_ID&quot;
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The creation timestamp of the link.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Describes this link.The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters.
  &quot;lifecycleState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource lifecycle state.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the link. The name can have up to 100 characters.

If the original method is standard Get/Create/Update, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse, where Xxx is the original method name.
