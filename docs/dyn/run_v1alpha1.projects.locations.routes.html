Some of the Revisions a Route distributes traffic over may be specified by referencing the Configuration responsible for creating them; in these cases the Route is additionally responsible for monitoring the Configuration for &quot;latest ready&quot; revision changes, and smoothly rolling out latest revisions. See also: https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/spec/overview.md#route Cloud Run currently supports referencing a single Configuration to automatically deploy the &quot;latest ready&quot; Revision from that Configuration.

    &quot;deletionTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated.

The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server. If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).
