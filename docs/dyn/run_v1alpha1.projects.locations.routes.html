  <pre>Rpc to list routes.

Args:
  parent: string, The project ID or project number from which the routes should be listed. (required)
  labelSelector: string, Allows to filter resources based on a label. Supported operations are
=, !=, exists, in, and notIn.
  includeUninitialized: boolean, Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  resourceVersion: string, The baseline resource version from which the list or watch operation should
start. Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  limit: integer, The maximum number of records that should be returned.
  watch: boolean, Flag that indicates that the client expects to watch this resource as well.
Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  continue: string, Optional encoded string to continue paging.
  fieldSelector: string, Allows to filter resources based on a specific value for a field name.
Send this in a query string format. i.e. 'metadata.name%3Dlorem'.
Not currently used by Cloud Run.

Returns:
  An object of the form:
