<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="cancelPreview">cancelPreview(project, deployment, body=None)</code>
  <pre>Cancels and removes the preview currently associated with the deployment.

Args:
  project: string, The project ID for this request. (required)
  deployment: string, The name of the deployment for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
    &quot;fingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies a fingerprint for `cancelPreview()` requests. A fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided in `cancelPreview()` requests to perform optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that the deployment does not have conflicting requests (e.g. if someone attempts to make a new update request while another user attempts to cancel a preview, this would prevent one of the requests).
        # 
        # The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify a deployment. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a `get()` request on the deployment.
  }


Returns:
  An object of the form:

    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(project, resource, optionsRequestedPolicyVersion=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource. May be empty if no such policy or resource exists.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  resource: string, Name or id of the resource for this request. (required)
  optionsRequestedPolicyVersion: integer, Requested IAM Policy version.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

  preview: boolean, If set to true, creates a deployment and creates &quot;shell&quot; resources but does not actually instantiate these resources. This allows you to preview what your deployment looks like. After previewing a deployment, you can deploy your resources by making a request with the `update()` method or you can use the `cancelPreview()` method to cancel the preview altogether. Note that the deployment will still exist after you cancel the preview and you must separately delete this deployment if you want to remove it.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all deployments for a given project.

Args:
  project: string, The project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false and the logic is the same as today.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A response containing a partial list of deployments and a page token used to build the next request if the request has been truncated.

      DELETE - 
  preview: boolean, If set to true, updates the deployment and creates and updates the &quot;shell&quot; resources but does not actually alter or instantiate these resources. This allows you to preview what your deployment will look like. You can use this intent to preview how an update would affect your deployment. You must provide a `target.config` with a configuration if this is set to true. After previewing a deployment, you can deploy your resources by making a request with the `update()` or you can `cancelPreview()` to remove the preview altogether. Note that the deployment will still exist after you cancel the preview and you must separately delete this deployment if you want to remove it.

      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

  preview: boolean, If set to true, updates the deployment and creates and updates the &quot;shell&quot; resources but does not actually alter or instantiate these resources. This allows you to preview what your deployment will look like. You can use this intent to preview how an update would affect your deployment. You must provide a `target.config` with a configuration if this is set to true. After previewing a deployment, you can deploy your resources by making a request with the `update()` or you can `cancelPreview()` to remove the preview altogether. Note that the deployment will still exist after you cancel the preview and you must separately delete this deployment if you want to remove it.
