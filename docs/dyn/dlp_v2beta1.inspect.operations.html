        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(name, pageSize=None, filter=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the
server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding
to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To
override the binding, API services can add a binding such as
`"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration.
For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations
collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding
is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation's parent resource. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The list page size. The max allowed value is 256 and default is 100.
  filter: string, This parameter supports filtering by done, ie done=true or done=false.
  pageToken: string, The list page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

            # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
            # consistent developer experience across different environments.
            #
            # Example uses of this error model include:
            #
            # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
            #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
            #     errors.
            #
            # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
            #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
            #
            # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
            #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
            #     each error sub-response.
            #
            # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
            #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
            #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
            #
            # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
            #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
          "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
              # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
              # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
          "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
          "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There will be a
              # common set of message types for APIs to use.
            {
              "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    ],

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
