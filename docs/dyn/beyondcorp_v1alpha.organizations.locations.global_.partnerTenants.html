  <pre>Creates a new BeyondCorp Enterprise partnerTenant in a given organization and can only be called by onboarded BeyondCorp Enterprise partner.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the parent organization using the form: `organizations/{organization_id}/locations/global` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Information about a BeyoncCorp Enterprise PartnerTenant.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An arbitrary caller-provided name for the PartnerTenant. Cannot exceed 64 characters.
  &quot;group&quot;: { # Message to capture group information # Optional. Group information for the users enabled to use the partnerTenant. If the group information is not provided then the partnerTenant will be enabled for all users.
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The group email id
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Google group id
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Unique resource name of the PartnerTenant. The name is ignored when creating PartnerTenant.
  &quot;partnerMetadata&quot;: { # Metadata associated with PartnerTenant and is provided by the Partner. # Optional. Metadata provided by the Partner associated with PartnerTenant.
    &quot;internalTenantId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. UUID used by the Partner to refer to the PartnerTenant in their internal systems.
    &quot;partnerTenantId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. UUID used by the Partner to refer to the PartnerTenant in their internal systems.
  },
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the resource was last modified.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
