  <pre>After the client finishes uploading the photo with the returned
UploadRef,
CreatePhoto
publishes the uploaded Photo to
Street View on Google Maps.

Currently, the only way to set heading, pitch, and roll in CreatePhoto is
through the [Photo Sphere XMP
metadata](https://developers.google.com/streetview/spherical-metadata) in
the photo bytes. CreatePhoto ignores the  `pose.heading`, `pose.pitch`,
`pose.roll`, `pose.altitude`, and `pose.level` fields in Pose.

This method returns the following error codes:

* google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT if the request is malformed or if
the uploaded photo is not a 360 photo.
* google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the upload reference does not exist.
* google.rpc.Code.RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED if the account has reached the
storage limit.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="startUpload">startUpload(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates an upload session to start uploading photo bytes.  The method uses
the upload URL of the returned
UploadRef to upload the bytes for
the Photo.

In addition to the photo requirements shown in
https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7012050?hl=en&ref_topic=6275604,
the photo must meet the following requirements:

* Photo Sphere XMP metadata must be included in the photo medadata. See
https://developers.google.com/streetview/spherical-metadata for the
required fields.
* The pixel size of the photo must meet the size requirements listed in
https://support.google.com/maps/answer/7012050?hl=en&ref_topic=6275604, and
the photo must be a full 360 horizontally.

After the upload completes, the method uses
UploadRef with
CreatePhoto
to create the Photo object entry.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      # 
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      # 
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Upload reference for media files.
    "uploadUrl": "A String", # Required. An upload reference should be unique for each user. It follows
        # the form:
        # "https://streetviewpublish.googleapis.com/media/user/{account_id}/photo/{upload_reference}"
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(id, body, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the metadata of a Photo, such
as pose, place association, connections, etc. Changing the pixels of a
photo is not supported.

Only the fields specified in the
updateMask
field are used. If `updateMask` is not present, the update applies to all
fields.

This method returns the following error codes:

* google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED if the requesting user did not
create the requested photo.
* google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT if the request is malformed.
* google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND if the requested photo does not exist.
* google.rpc.Code.UNAVAILABLE if the requested
Photo is still being indexed.
