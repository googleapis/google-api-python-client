  <pre>Searches for URLs matching known threats. Each URL and it&#x27;s host-suffix and path-prefix expressions (up to a limited depth) are checked. This means that the response may contain URLs that were not included in the request, but are expressions of the requested URLs.

Args:
  urls: string, Required. The URLs to be looked up. Clients MUST NOT send more than 50 URLs. (repeated)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response returned after searching threats matching the specified URLs. If nothing is found, the server will return an OK status (HTTP status code 200) with the `threats` field empty, rather than returning a NOT_FOUND status (HTTP status code 404).
  &quot;cacheDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The client-side cache duration. The client MUST add this duration to the current time to determine the expiration time. The expiration time then applies to every URL queried by the client in the request, regardless of how many URLs are returned in the response. Even if the server returns no matches for a particular URL, this fact MUST also be cached by the client. If and only if the field `threats` is empty, the client MAY increase the `cache_duration` to determine a new expiration that is later than that specified by the server. In any case, the increased cache duration must not be longer than 24 hours. Important: the client MUST NOT assume that the server will return the same cache duration for all responses. The server MAY choose different cache durations for different responses depending on the situation.
  &quot;threats&quot;: [ # Unordered list. The unordered list of threat matches found. Each entry contains a URL and the threat types that were found matching that URL. The list size can be greater than the number of URLs in the request as the all expressions of the URL would&#x27;ve been considered.
    { # A URL matching one or more threats.
      &quot;threatTypes&quot;: [ # Unordered list. The unordered list of threat that the URL is classified as.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;url&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The requested URL that was matched by one or more threats.
    },
  ],
