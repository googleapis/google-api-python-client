  <pre>Creates new workflow template.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the region or location, as described in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names.
For projects.regions.workflowTemplates,create, the resource name of the  region has the following format:  projects/{project_id}/regions/{region}
For projects.locations.workflowTemplates.create, the resource name of  the location has the following format:  projects/{project_id}/locations/{location} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Optional. Used to perform a consistent read-modify-write.This field should be left blank for a CreateWorkflowTemplate request. It is required for an UpdateWorkflowTemplate request, and must match the current server version. A typical update template flow would fetch the current template with a GetWorkflowTemplate request, which will return the current template with the version field filled in with the current server version. The user updates other fields in the template, then returns it as part of the UpdateWorkflowTemplate request.

  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds one or more members to a single role. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).JSON example:

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.
    &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        # Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy  that includes conditionsImportant: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
    &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of members to a role. Optionally, may specify a condition that determines how and when the bindings are applied. Each of the bindings must contain at least one member.
      { # Associates members with a role.

The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec.Example (Comparison): # The condition that is associated with this binding.If the condition evaluates to true, then this binding applies to the current request.If the condition evaluates to false, then this binding does not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding might grant the same role to one or more of the members in this binding.To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

A binding binds one or more members to a single role. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).JSON example: # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the resource.

    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for TestIamPermissions method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the resource. Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more information see IAM Overview (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      &quot;A String&quot;,

  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for TestIamPermissions method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of TestPermissionsRequest.permissions that the caller is allowed.

            # placement.clusterSelector.clusterLabels&#x27;key&#x27;
