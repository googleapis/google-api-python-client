<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, requestId=None, validateOnly=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a single Hub.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the resource. (required)
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, validates request by executing a dry-run which would not alter the resource in any way.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets details of a single Hub.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the Hub using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/securityGateway/{security_gateway_id}/hubs/{hub_id}` (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A Beyondcorp Hub resource information.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the resource was created.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An arbitrary user-provided name for the Hub. Cannot exceed 64 characters.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. Name of the resource.
  &quot;natGatewayConfig&quot;: { # Represents the NAT Gateway configuration. # Required. NAT gateway setup to ensure enough NAT IP addresses are available to handle the traffic needed to access the applications. Allows to explicitly enable or disable the NAT in the Hub along with the total IPs allocated to handle the capacity limits.
    &quot;enableNatGateway&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Explicitly enable or disable the NAT Gateway. This is defaulted to false until NAT Gateway configuration is fully supported and any request with a disable option will be rejected.
    &quot;natIps&quot;: [ # Output only. List of NAT IPs that will be used for establishing connection to the endpoints.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The operational state of the Hub.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Hubs in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent location to which the resources belong. `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/securityGateways/{security_gateway_id}` (required)
  filter: string, Optional. A filter specifying constraints of a list operation. All fields in the Hub message are supported. For example, the following query will return the Hub with displayName &quot;test-hub&quot; For more information, please refer to https://google.aip.dev/160.
  orderBy: string, Optional. Specifies the ordering of results. See [Sorting order](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/design_patterns#sorting_order) for more information.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of items to return. If not specified, a default value of 50 will be used by the service. Regardless of the page_size value, the response may include a partial list and a caller should only rely on response&#x27;s next_page_token to determine if there are more instances left to be queried.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The next_page_token value returned from a previous ListHubsRequest, if any.
