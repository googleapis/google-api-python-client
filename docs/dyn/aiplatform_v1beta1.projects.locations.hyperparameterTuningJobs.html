  <pre>Cancels a HyperparameterTuningJob. Starts asynchronous cancellation on the HyperparameterTuningJob. The server makes a best effort to cancel the job, but success is not guaranteed. Clients can use JobService.GetHyperparameterTuningJob or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the job completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the HyperparameterTuningJob is not deleted; instead it becomes a job with a HyperparameterTuningJob.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`, and HyperparameterTuningJob.state is set to `CANCELLED`.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the HyperparameterTuningJob to cancel. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/hyperparameterTuningJobs/{hyperparameter_tuning_job}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for JobService.CancelHyperparameterTuningJob.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

Note that the first few rules (e.g. minimum_runtime_constraint, min_num_trials) will prevent other stopping rules from being evaluated until they are met. For example, setting `min_num_trials=5` and `always_stop_after= 1 hour` means that the Study will ONLY stop after it has 5 COMPLETED trials, even if more than an hour has passed since its creation. It follows the first applicable rule (whose &quot;if&quot; condition is satisfied) to make a stopping decision. If none of the specified rules are applicable, then Vizier decides that the study should not stop. If Vizier decides that the study should stop, the study enters STOPPING state (or STOPPING_ASAP if should_stop_asap = true). IMPORTANT: The automatic study state transition happens precisely as described above; that is, deleting trials or updating StudyConfig NEVER automatically moves the study state back to ACTIVE.

For example, setting `min_num_trials=5` and `always_stop_after= 1 hour` means that the Study will ONLY stop after it has 5 COMPLETED trials, even if more than an hour has passed since its creation. It follows the first applicable rule (whose &quot;if&quot; condition is satisfied) to make a stopping decision.

For example, setting `min_num_trials=5` and `always_stop_after= 1 hour` means that the Study will ONLY stop after it has 5 COMPLETED trials, even if more than an hour has passed since its creation.
