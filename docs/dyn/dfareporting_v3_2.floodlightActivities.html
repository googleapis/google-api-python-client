  <pre>Retrieves a list of floodlight activities, possibly filtered. This method supports paging.

Args:
  profileId: string, User profile ID associated with this request. (required)
  floodlightActivityGroupName: string, Select only floodlight activities with the specified floodlight activity group name.
  advertiserId: string, Select only floodlight activities for the specified advertiser ID. Must specify either ids, advertiserId, or floodlightConfigurationId for a non-empty result.
  tagString: string, Select only floodlight activities with the specified tag string.

      DESCENDING - 
  maxResults: integer, Maximum number of results to return.
  searchString: string, Allows searching for objects by name or ID. Wildcards (*) are allowed. For example, "floodlightactivity*2015" will return objects with names like "floodlightactivity June 2015", "floodlightactivity April 2015", or simply "floodlightactivity 2015". Most of the searches also add wildcards implicitly at the start and the end of the search string. For example, a search string of "floodlightactivity" will match objects with name "my floodlightactivity activity", "floodlightactivity 2015", or simply "floodlightactivity".
  sortField: string, Field by which to sort the list.
    Allowed values
      ID -
