<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="split">split(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Splits capacity commitment to two commitments of the same plan and `commitment_end_time`. A common use case is to enable downgrading commitments. For example, in order to downgrade from 10000 slots to 8000, you might split a 10000 capacity commitment into commitments of 2000 and 8000. Then, you delete the first one after the commitment end time passes.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name e.g.,: `projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/123` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for ReservationService.SplitCapacityCommitment.
  &quot;slotCount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Number of slots in the capacity commitment after the split.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
