  &quot;rolloutOrchestrationStrategy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The strategy used for executing this Rollout. This strategy will override whatever strategy is specified in the RolloutType. If not specified on creation, the strategy from RolloutType will be used. There are two supported values strategies which are used to control - &quot;Google.Cloud.Simple.AllAtOnce&quot; - &quot;Google.Cloud.Simple.OneLocationAtATime&quot; A rollout with one of these simple strategies will rollout across all locations defined in the targeted UnitKind&#x27;s Saas Locations.
  &quot;rootRollout&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Output only. The root rollout that this rollout is stemming from. The resource name (full URI of the resource) following the standard naming scheme: &quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/rollouts/{rollout_id}&quot;

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  rolloutId: string, Required. The ID value for the new rollout.

  <pre>Delete a single rollout.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the resource within a service. (required)
  etag: string, The etag known to the client for the expected state of the rollout. This is used with state-changing methods to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in parallel on the same resource. An etag wildcard provide optimistic concurrency based on the expected existence of the rollout. The Any wildcard (`*`) requires that the resource must already exists, and the Not Any wildcard (`!*`) requires that it must not.
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Rollout resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields in the Rollout will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, If &quot;validate_only&quot; is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
