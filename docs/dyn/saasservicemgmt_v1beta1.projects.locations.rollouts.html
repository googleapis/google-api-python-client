  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a single rollout execution and its results
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Optional. Annotations is an unstructured key-value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;control&quot;: { # RolloutControl provides a way to request a change to the execution of a Rollout by pausing or canceling it. # Optional. Requested change to the execution of this rollout. Default RolloutControl.action is ROLLOUT_ACTION_RUN meaning the rollout will be executed to completion while progressing through all natural Rollout States (such as RUNNING -&gt; SUCCEEDED or RUNNING -&gt; FAILED). Requests can only be made when the Rollout is in a non-terminal state.
    &quot;action&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Action to be performed on the Rollout. The default behavior is to run the rollout until it naturally reaches a terminal state.
    &quot;runParams&quot;: { # Parameters for the RUN action controlling the behavior of the rollout when it is resumed from a PAUSED state. # Optional. Parameters for the RUN action. It is an error to specify this if the RolloutAction is not set to RUN. By default, the rollout will retry failed operations when resumed.
      &quot;retryFailedOperations&quot;: True or False, # Required. If true, the rollout will retry failed operations when resumed. This is applicable only the current state of the Rollout is PAUSED and the requested action is RUN.

Contains a CEL(https://github.com/google/cel-spec) expression consisting of a conjunction of Rollout.unit_filter and RolloutKind.unit_filter. This field captures the filter applied by the Rollout to determine the Unit population.

  &quot;endTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Output only. The time when the rollout finished execution (regardless of success, failure, or cancellation). Will be empty if the rollout hasn&#x27;t finished yet. Once set, the rollout is in terminal state and all the results are final.

  &quot;rolloutOrchestrationStrategy&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The strategy used for executing this Rollout. This strategy will override whatever strategy is specified in the RolloutKind. If not specified on creation, the strategy from RolloutKind will be used. There are two supported values strategies which are used to control - &quot;Google.Cloud.Simple.AllAtOnce&quot; - &quot;Google.Cloud.Simple.OneLocationAtATime&quot; A rollout with one of these simple strategies will rollout across all locations defined in the targeted UnitKind&#x27;s Saas Locations.
  &quot;rootRollout&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Output only. The root rollout that this rollout is stemming from. The resource name (full URI of the resource) following the standard naming scheme: &quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}/rollouts/{rollout_id}&quot;

This can be used to determine the number of units which have been updated, or are scheduled to be updated. There will be at most one entry per group. Possible values for operation groups are: - &quot;SCHEDULED&quot; - &quot;PENDING&quot; - &quot;RUNNING&quot; - &quot;SUCCEEDED&quot; - &quot;FAILED&quot; - &quot;CANCELLED&quot;
      { # Represents the aggregation of a set of population of like records by a certain group. For example, a collection of unit counts can be aggregated and grouped by their state.
        &quot;count&quot;: 42, # Required. Number of records in the group.
        &quot;group&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Group by which to aggregate.

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  rolloutId: string, Required. The ID value for the new rollout.
  validateOnly: boolean, If &quot;validate_only&quot; is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Rollout resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields in the Rollout will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, If &quot;validate_only&quot; is set to true, the service will try to validate that this request would succeed, but will not actually make changes.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
