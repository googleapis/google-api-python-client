<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a fleet.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent (project and location) where the Fleet will be created. Specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Fleet contains the Fleet-wide metadata and configuration.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the Fleet was created.
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the Fleet was deleted.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A user-assigned display name of the Fleet. When present, it must be between 4 to 30 characters. Allowed characters are: lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, hyphen, single-quote, double-quote, space, and exclamation point. Example: `Production Fleet`
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The full, unique resource name of this fleet in the format of `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/fleets/{fleet}`. Each GCP project can have at most one fleet resource, named &quot;default&quot;.
  &quot;state&quot;: { # FleetLifecycleState describes the state of a Fleet resource. # Output only. State of the namespace resource.
    &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the Fleet resource.
  },
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Google-generated UUID for this resource. This is unique across all Fleet resources. If a Fleet resource is deleted and another resource with the same name is created, it gets a different uid.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. When the Fleet was last updated.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
