<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="runpagespeed">runpagespeed(url, screenshot=None, locale=None, rule=None, strategy=None, filter_third_party_resources=None)</code>
  <pre>Runs PageSpeed analysis on the page at the specified URL, and returns a PageSpeed score, a list of suggestions to make that page faster, and other information.

Args:
  url: string, The URL to fetch and analyze (required)
  screenshot: boolean, Indicates if binary data containing a screenshot should be included
  locale: string, The locale used to localize formatted results
  rule: string, A PageSpeed rule to run; if none are given, all rules are run (repeated)
  strategy: string, The analysis strategy to use
    Allowed values
      desktop - Fetch and analyze the URL for desktop browsers
      mobile - Fetch and analyze the URL for mobile devices
  filter_third_party_resources: boolean, Indicates if third party resources should be filtered out before PageSpeed analysis.

Returns:
  An object of the form:
