<div class="method">

  <pre>Returns insights for Business calls for a location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent location to fetch calls insights for. Format: locations/{location_id} (required)
  filter: string, Optional. A filter constraining the calls insights to return. The response includes only entries that match the filter. If the MetricType is not provided, AGGREGATE_COUNT is returned. If no end_date is provided, the last date for which data is available is used. If no start_date is provided, we will default to the first date for which data is available, which is currently 6 months. If start_date is before the date when data is available, data is returned starting from the date when it is available. At this time we support following filters. 1. start_date=&quot;DATE&quot; where date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. 2. end_date=&quot;DATE&quot; where date is in YYYY-MM-DD format. 3. metric_type=XYZ where XYZ is a valid MetricType. 4. Conjunctions(AND) of all of the above. e.g., &quot;start_date=2021-08-01 AND end_date=2021-08-10 AND metric_type=AGGREGATE_COUNT&quot; The AGGREGATE_COUNT metric_type ignores the DD part of the date.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of BusinessCallsInsights to return. If unspecified, at most 20 will be returned. Some of the metric_types(e.g, AGGREGATE_COUNT) returns a single page. For these metrics, the page_size is ignored.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListBusinessCallsInsights` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListBusinessCallsInsights` must match the call that provided the page token. Some of the metric_types (e.g, AGGREGATE_COUNT) returns a single page. For these metrics, the pake_token is ignored.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
