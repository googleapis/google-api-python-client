<p class="firstline">Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using "default_branch" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.</p>

  <pre>Completes the specified prefix with keyword suggestions. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Enable Retail Search on Cloud Console before using this feature.

Args:
  catalog: string, Required. Catalog for which the completion is performed. Full resource name of catalog, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`. (required)
  dataset: string, Determines which dataset to use for fetching completion. &quot;user-data&quot; will use the imported dataset through CompletionService.ImportCompletionData. &quot;cloud-retail&quot; will use the dataset generated by cloud retail based on user events. If leave empty, it will use the &quot;user-data&quot;. Current supported values: * user-data * cloud-retail: This option requires enabling auto-learning function first. See [guidelines](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/completion-overview#generated-completion-dataset).
  deviceType: string, The device type context for completion suggestions. We recommend that you leave this field empty. It can apply different suggestions on different device types, e.g. `DESKTOP`, `MOBILE`. If it is empty, the suggestions are across all device types. Supported formats: * `UNKNOWN_DEVICE_TYPE` * `DESKTOP` * `MOBILE` * A customized string starts with `OTHER_`, e.g. `OTHER_IPHONE`.
  enableAttributeSuggestions: boolean, If true, attribute suggestions are enabled and provided in the response. This field is only available for the &quot;cloud-retail&quot; dataset.
  entity: string, The entity for customers who run multiple entities, domains, sites, or regions, for example, `Google US`, `Google Ads`, `Waymo`, `google.com`, `youtube.com`, etc. If this is set, it must be an exact match with UserEvent.entity to get per-entity autocomplete results.
  languageCodes: string, Note that this field applies for `user-data` dataset only. For requests with `cloud-retail` dataset, setting this field has no effect. The language filters applied to the output suggestions. If set, it should contain the language of the query. If not set, suggestions are returned without considering language restrictions. This is the BCP-47 language code, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47). The maximum number of language codes is 3. (repeated)
  maxSuggestions: integer, Completion max suggestions. If left unset or set to 0, then will fallback to the configured value CompletionConfig.max_suggestions. The maximum allowed max suggestions is 20. If it is set higher, it will be capped by 20.
  query: string, Required. The query used to generate suggestions. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
  visitorId: string, Required field. A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if the visitor logs in or out of the website. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

This field is `False` for pre-loaded CatalogAttributes. Only pre-loaded catalog attributes that are neither in use by products nor predefined can be deleted. Catalog attributes that are either in use by products or are predefined attributes cannot be deleted; however, their configuration properties will reset to default values upon removal request.

To be indexable, the attribute name can contain only alpha-numeric characters and underscores. For example, an attribute named `attributes.abc_xyz` can be indexed, but an attribute named `attributes.abc-xyz` cannot be indexed. If the attribute key starts with `attributes.`, then the attribute is a custom attribute. Attributes such as `brands`, `patterns`, and `title` are built-in and called system attributes.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setDefaultBranch">setDefaultBranch(catalog, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using &quot;default_branch&quot; to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.

  catalog: string, Full resource name of the catalog, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`. (required)

  &quot;force&quot;: True or False, # If set to true, it permits switching to a branch with branch_id even if it has no sufficient active products.
  &quot;note&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Some note on this request, this can be retrieved by CatalogService.GetDefaultBranch before next valid default branch set occurs. This field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.
