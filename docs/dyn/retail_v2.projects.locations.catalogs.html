<p class="firstline">Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using "default_branch" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.

  dataset: string, Determines which dataset to use for fetching completion. &quot;user-data&quot; will use the imported dataset through CompletionService.ImportCompletionData. &quot;cloud-retail&quot; will use the dataset generated by cloud retail based on user events. If leave empty, it will use the &quot;user-data&quot;. Current supported values: * user-data * cloud-retail This option requires additional allowlisting. Before using cloud-retail, contact Cloud Retail support team first.
  deviceType: string, The device type context for completion suggestions. It is useful to apply different suggestions on different device types, e.g. `DESKTOP`, `MOBILE`. If it is empty, the suggestions are across all device types. Supported formats: * `UNKNOWN_DEVICE_TYPE` * `DESKTOP` * `MOBILE` * A customized string starts with `OTHER_`, e.g. `OTHER_IPHONE`.
  languageCodes: string, The list of languages of the query. This is the BCP-47 language code, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;.

  maxSuggestions: integer, Completion max suggestions. If left unset or set to 0, then will fallback to the configured value CompletionConfig.max_suggestions. The maximum allowed max suggestions is 20. If it is set higher, it will be capped by 20.
  query: string, Required. The query used to generate suggestions. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
