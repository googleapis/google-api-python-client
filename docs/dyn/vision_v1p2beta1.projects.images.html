  <pre>Run image detection and annotation for a batch of images.

Args:
  parent: string, Optional. Target project and location to make a call. Format: `projects/{project-id}/locations/{location-id}`. If no parent is specified, a region will be chosen automatically. Supported location-ids: `us`: USA country only, `asia`: East asia areas, like Japan, Taiwan, `eu`: The European Union. Example: `projects/project-A/locations/eu`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

        &quot;source&quot;: { # External image source (Google Cloud Storage or web URL image location). # Google Cloud Storage image location, or publicly-accessible image URL.

Object versioning is not supported. See [Google Cloud Storage Request URIs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference-uris) for more info. 2. A publicly-accessible image HTTP/HTTPS URL. When fetching images from HTTP/HTTPS URLs, Google cannot guarantee that the request will be completed. Your request may fail if the specified host denies the request (e.g. due to request throttling or DOS prevention), or if Google throttles requests to the site for abuse prevention. You should not depend on externally-hosted images for production applications. When both `gcs_image_uri` and `image_uri` are specified, `image_uri` takes precedence.

By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5.

Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

    <code class="details" id="asyncBatchAnnotate">asyncBatchAnnotate(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Run asynchronous image detection and annotation for a list of images. Progress and results can be retrieved through the `google.longrunning.Operations` interface. `Operation.metadata` contains `OperationMetadata` (metadata). `Operation.response` contains `AsyncBatchAnnotateImagesResponse` (results). This service will write image annotation outputs to json files in customer GCS bucket, each json file containing BatchAnnotateImagesResponse proto.

Args:
  parent: string, Optional. Target project and location to make a call. Format: `projects/{project-id}/locations/{location-id}`. If no parent is specified, a region will be chosen automatically. Supported location-ids: `us`: USA country only, `asia`: East asia areas, like Japan, Taiwan, `eu`: The European Union. Example: `projects/project-A/locations/eu`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for async image annotation for a list of images.
  &quot;outputConfig&quot;: { # The desired output location and metadata. # Required. The desired output location and metadata (e.g. format).
    &quot;batchSize&quot;: 42, # The max number of response protos to put into each output JSON file on Google Cloud Storage. The valid range is [1, 100]. If not specified, the default value is 20. For example, for one pdf file with 100 pages, 100 response protos will be generated. If `batch_size` = 20, then 5 json files each containing 20 response protos will be written under the prefix `gcs_destination`.`uri`. Currently, batch_size only applies to GcsDestination, with potential future support for other output configurations.
    &quot;gcsDestination&quot;: { # The Google Cloud Storage location where the output will be written to. # The Google Cloud Storage location to write the output(s) to.
      &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Google Cloud Storage URI prefix where the results will be stored. Results will be in JSON format and preceded by its corresponding input URI prefix. This field can either represent a gcs file prefix or gcs directory. In either case, the uri should be unique because in order to get all of the output files, you will need to do a wildcard gcs search on the uri prefix you provide. Examples: * File Prefix: gs://bucket-name/here/filenameprefix The output files will be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the output files will begin with &quot;filenameprefix&quot;. * Directory Prefix: gs://bucket-name/some/location/ The output files will be created in gs://bucket-name/some/location/ and the names of the output files could be anything because there was no filename prefix specified. If multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each of which contains some subset of the full list of AnnotateImageResponse. Multiple outputs can happen if, for example, the output JSON is too large and overflows into multiple sharded files.

When fetching images from HTTP/HTTPS URLs, Google cannot guarantee that the request will be completed. Your request may fail if the specified host denies the request (e.g. due to request throttling or DOS prevention), or if Google throttles requests to the site for abuse prevention. You should not depend on externally-hosted images for production applications. When both `gcs_image_uri` and `image_uri` are specified, `image_uri` takes precedence.
