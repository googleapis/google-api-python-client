Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the billing account to create the budget in. Values are of the form `billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A budget is a plan that describes what you expect to spend on Cloud projects, plus the rules to execute as spend is tracked against that plan, (for example, send an alert when 90% of the target spend is met). The budget time period is configurable, with options such as month (default), quarter, year, or custom time period.
  &quot;amount&quot;: { # The budgeted amount for each usage period. # Required. Budgeted amount.
    &quot;lastPeriodAmount&quot;: { # Describes a budget amount targeted to the last Filter.calendar_period spend. At this time, the amount is automatically 100% of the last calendar period&#x27;s spend; that is, there are no other options yet. LastPeriodAmount cannot be set for a budget configured with a Filter.custom_period. # Use the last period&#x27;s actual spend as the budget for the present period. LastPeriodAmount can only be set when the budget&#x27;s time period is a Filter.calendar_period. It cannot be set in combination with Filter.custom_period.
    },
    &quot;specifiedAmount&quot;: { # Represents an amount of money with its currency type. # A specified amount to use as the budget. `currency_code` is optional. If specified when creating a budget, it must match the currency of the billing account. If specified when updating a budget, it must match the currency_code of the existing budget. The `currency_code` is provided on output.

If `units` is zero, `nanos` can be positive, zero, or negative. If `units` is negative, `nanos` must be negative or zero. For example $-1.75 is represented as `units`=-1 and `nanos`=-750,000,000.
      &quot;units&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The whole units of the amount. For example if `currencyCode` is `&quot;USD&quot;`, then 1 unit is one US dollar.
    },
  },

  &quot;notificationsRule&quot;: { # NotificationsRule defines notifications that are sent based on budget spend and thresholds. # Optional. Rules to apply to notifications sent based on budget spend and thresholds.
    &quot;disableDefaultIamRecipients&quot;: True or False, # Optional. When set to true, disables default notifications sent when a threshold is exceeded. Default notifications are sent to those with Billing Account Administrator and Billing Account User IAM roles for the target account.
    &quot;monitoringNotificationChannels&quot;: [ # Optional. Email targets to send notifications to when a threshold is exceeded. This is in addition to the `DefaultIamRecipients` who receive alert emails based on their billing account IAM role. The value is the full REST resource name of a Cloud Monitoring email notification channel with the form `projects/{project_id}/notificationChannels/{channel_id}`. A maximum of 5 email notifications are allowed. To customize budget alert email recipients with monitoring notification channels, you _must create the monitoring notification channels before you link them to a budget_. For guidance on setting up notification channels to use with budgets, see [Customize budget alert email recipients](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-notification-recipients). For Cloud Billing budget alerts, you _must use email notification channels_. The other types of notification channels are _not_ supported, such as Slack, SMS, or PagerDuty. If you want to [send budget notifications to Slack](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/notify#send_notifications_to_slack), use a pubsubTopic and configure [programmatic notifications](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications).

    ],
    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the Pub/Sub topic where budget-related messages are published, in the form `projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}`. Updates are sent to the topic at regular intervals; the timing of the updates is not dependent on the [threshold rules](#thresholdrule) you&#x27;ve set. Note that if you want your [Pub/Sub JSON object](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format) to contain data for `alertThresholdExceeded`, you need at least one [alert threshold rule](#thresholdrule). When you set threshold rules, you must also enable at least one of the email notification options, either using the default IAM recipients or Cloud Monitoring email notification channels. To use Pub/Sub topics with budgets, you must do the following: 1. Create the Pub/Sub topic before connecting it to your budget. For guidance, see [Manage programmatic budget alert notifications](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications). 2. Grant the API caller the `pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy` permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call fails with PERMISSION_DENIED. For additional details on Pub/Sub roles and permissions, see [Permissions required for this task](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#permissions_required_for_this_task).
    &quot;schemaVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Required when NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic is set. The schema version of the notification sent to NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic. Only &quot;1.0&quot; is accepted. It represents the JSON schema as defined in https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format.
  },
  &quot;thresholdRules&quot;: [ # Optional. Rules that trigger alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed) when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. Optional for `pubsubTopic` notifications. Required if using email notifications.
    { # ThresholdRule contains the definition of a threshold. Threshold rules define the triggering events used to generate a budget notification email. When a threshold is crossed (spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget), budget alert emails are sent to the email recipients you specify in the [NotificationsRule](#notificationsrule). Threshold rules also affect the fields included in the [JSON data object](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format) sent to a Pub/Sub topic. Threshold rules are _required_ if using email notifications. Threshold rules are _optional_ if only setting a [`pubsubTopic` NotificationsRule](#NotificationsRule), unless you want your JSON data object to include data about the thresholds you set. For more information, see [set budget threshold rules and actions](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets#budget-actions).
      &quot;spendBasis&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The type of basis used to determine if spend has passed the threshold. Behavior defaults to CURRENT_SPEND if not set.
      &quot;thresholdPercent&quot;: 3.14, # Required. Send an alert when this threshold is exceeded. This is a 1.0-based percentage, so 0.5 = 50%. Validation: non-negative number.

Grant the API caller the `pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy` permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call fails with PERMISSION_DENIED. For additional details on Pub/Sub roles and permissions, see [Permissions required for this task](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#permissions_required_for_this_task).
    &quot;schemaVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Required when NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic is set. The schema version of the notification sent to NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic. Only &quot;1.0&quot; is accepted. It represents the JSON schema as defined in https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format.
  },
  &quot;thresholdRules&quot;: [ # Optional. Rules that trigger alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed) when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. Optional for `pubsubTopic` notifications. Required if using email notifications.
    { # ThresholdRule contains the definition of a threshold. Threshold rules define the triggering events used to generate a budget notification email. When a threshold is crossed (spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget), budget alert emails are sent to the email recipients you specify in the [NotificationsRule](#notificationsrule). Threshold rules also affect the fields included in the [JSON data object](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format) sent to a Pub/Sub topic. Threshold rules are _required_ if using email notifications. Threshold rules are _optional_ if only setting a [`pubsubTopic` NotificationsRule](#NotificationsRule), unless you want your JSON data object to include data about the thresholds you set. For more information, see [set budget threshold rules and actions](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets#budget-actions).

To use Pub/Sub topics with budgets, you must do the following: 1. Create the Pub/Sub topic before connecting it to your budget. For guidance, see [Manage programmatic budget alert notifications](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications). 2. Grant the API caller the `pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy` permission on the Pub/Sub topic. If not set, the API call fails with PERMISSION_DENIED. For additional details on Pub/Sub roles and permissions, see [Permissions required for this task](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#permissions_required_for_this_task).
    &quot;schemaVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Required when NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic is set. The schema version of the notification sent to NotificationsRule.pubsub_topic. Only &quot;1.0&quot; is accepted. It represents the JSON schema as defined in https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format.
  },
  &quot;thresholdRules&quot;: [ # Optional. Rules that trigger alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed) when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. Optional for `pubsubTopic` notifications. Required if using email notifications.
    { # ThresholdRule contains the definition of a threshold. Threshold rules define the triggering events used to generate a budget notification email. When a threshold is crossed (spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget), budget alert emails are sent to the email recipients you specify in the [NotificationsRule](#notificationsrule). Threshold rules also affect the fields included in the [JSON data object](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets-programmatic-notifications#notification_format) sent to a Pub/Sub topic. Threshold rules are _required_ if using email notifications. Threshold rules are _optional_ if only setting a [`pubsubTopic` NotificationsRule](#NotificationsRule), unless you want your JSON data object to include data about the thresholds you set. For more information, see [set budget threshold rules and actions](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets#budget-actions).
      &quot;spendBasis&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The type of basis used to determine if spend has passed the threshold. Behavior defaults to CURRENT_SPEND if not set.
      &quot;thresholdPercent&quot;: 3.14, # Required. Send an alert when this threshold is exceeded. This is a 1.0-based percentage, so 0.5 = 50%. Validation: non-negative number.
