Unjoined user event definition: when a user event is ingested from Recommendations AI User Event APIs, the catalog item included in the user event is connected with the current catalog.

<div class="method">

  <pre>Writes a single user event from the browser. This uses a GET request to due to browser restriction of POST-ing to a 3rd party domain. This method is used only by the Recommendations AI JavaScript pixel. Users should not call this method directly.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent eventStore name, such as `projects/1234/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/eventStores/default_event_store`. (required)
  ets: string, Optional. The event timestamp in milliseconds. This prevents browser caching of otherwise identical get requests. The name is abbreviated to reduce the payload bytes.
  uri: string, Optional. The url including cgi-parameters but excluding the hash fragment. The URL must be truncated to 1.5K bytes to conservatively be under the 2K bytes. This is often more useful than the referer url, because many browsers only send the domain for 3rd party requests.
  userEvent: string, Required. URL encoded UserEvent proto.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for payload formats that can&#x27;t be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or an HTML page. This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example: message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id = 1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
  &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP Content-Type header value specifying the content type of the body.
  &quot;data&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP request/response body as raw binary.
  &quot;extensions&quot;: [ # Application specific response metadata. Must be set in the first response for streaming APIs.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a list of user events within a time range, with potential filtering. The method does not list unjoined user events. Unjoined user event definition: when a user event is ingested from Recommendations AI User Event APIs, the catalog item included in the user event is connected with the current catalog. If a catalog item of the ingested event is not in the current catalog, it could lead to degraded model quality. This is called an unjoined event.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent eventStore resource name, such as `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/default_catalog/eventStores/default_event_store`. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Filtering expression to specify restrictions over returned events. This is a sequence of terms, where each term applies some kind of a restriction to the returned user events. Use this expression to restrict results to a specific time range, or filter events by eventType. eg: eventTime &gt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z&quot; eventsMissingCatalogItems eventTime&lt;&quot;2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z&quot; eventType=search We expect only 3 types of fields: * eventTime: this can be specified a maximum of 2 times, once with a less than operator and once with a greater than operator. The eventTime restrict should result in one contiguous valid eventTime range. * eventType: only 1 eventType restriction can be specified. * eventsMissingCatalogItems: specififying this will restrict results to events for which catalog items were not found in the catalog. The default behavior is to return only those events for which catalog items were found. Some examples of valid filters expressions: * Example 1: eventTime &gt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z&quot; eventTime &lt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z&quot; * Example 2: eventTime &gt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z&quot; eventType = detail-page-view * Example 3: eventsMissingCatalogItems eventType = search eventTime &lt; &quot;2018-04-23T18:30:43.511Z&quot; * Example 4: eventTime &gt; &quot;2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z&quot; * Example 5: eventType = search * Example 6: eventsMissingCatalogItems
  pageSize: integer, Optional. Maximum number of results to return per page. If zero, the service will choose a reasonable default.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The previous ListUserEventsResponse.next_page_token.

Users can arrive at the site by coming to the site directly, or coming through Google search, and etc.
