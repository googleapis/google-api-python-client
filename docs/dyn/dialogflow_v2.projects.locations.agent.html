    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="updateFulfillment">updateFulfillment(name, body=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the fulfillment.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The unique identifier of the fulfillment. Format: `projects//agent/fulfillment`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # By default, your agent responds to a matched intent with a static response. As an alternative, you can provide a more dynamic response by using fulfillment. When you enable fulfillment for an intent, Dialogflow responds to that intent by calling a service that you define. For example, if an end-user wants to schedule a haircut on Friday, your service can check your database and respond to the end-user with availability information for Friday. For more information, see the [fulfillment guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-overview).
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The human-readable name of the fulfillment, unique within the agent.
  &quot;enabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether fulfillment is enabled.
  &quot;features&quot;: [ # Optional. The field defines whether the fulfillment is enabled for certain features.
    { # Whether fulfillment is enabled for the specific feature.
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of the feature that enabled for fulfillment.
    },
  ],
  &quot;genericWebService&quot;: { # Represents configuration for a generic web service. Dialogflow supports two mechanisms for authentications: - Basic authentication with username and password. - Authentication with additional authentication headers. More information could be found at: https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-configure. # Configuration for a generic web service.
    &quot;isCloudFunction&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if generic web service is created through Cloud Functions integration. Defaults to false.
    &quot;password&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The password for HTTP Basic authentication.
    &quot;requestHeaders&quot;: { # Optional. The HTTP request headers to send together with fulfillment requests.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
    &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The fulfillment URI for receiving POST requests. It must use https protocol.
    &quot;username&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The user name for HTTP Basic authentication.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The unique identifier of the fulfillment. Format: `projects//agent/fulfillment`.
}

  updateMask: string, Required. The mask to control which fields get updated. If the mask is not present, all fields will be updated.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
