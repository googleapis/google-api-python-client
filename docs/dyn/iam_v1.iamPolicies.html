<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="lintPolicy">lintPolicy(body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lints a Cloud IAM policy object or its sub fields. Currently supports
google.iam.v1.Policy, google.iam.v1.Binding and
google.iam.v1.Binding.condition.

Each lint operation consists of multiple lint validation units.
Validation units have the following properties:

- Each unit inspects the input object in regard to a particular
  linting aspect and issues a google.iam.admin.v1.LintResult
  disclosing the result.
- Domain of discourse of each unit can be either
  google.iam.v1.Policy, google.iam.v1.Binding, or
  google.iam.v1.Binding.condition depending on the purpose of the
  validation.
- A unit may require additional data (like the list of all possible
  enumerable values of a particular attribute used in the policy instance)
  which shall be provided by the caller. Refer to the comments of
  google.iam.admin.v1.LintPolicyRequest.context for more details.

The set of applicable validation units is determined by the Cloud IAM
server and is not configurable.

Regardless of any lint issues or their severities, successful calls to
`lintPolicy` return an HTTP 200 OK status code.
