  <pre>Get information about a route.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the route to retrieve. For Cloud Run (fully managed), replace {namespace} with the project ID or number. It takes the form namespaces/{namespace}. For example: namespaces/PROJECT_ID (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
