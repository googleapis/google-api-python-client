<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchDelete">batchDelete(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a list of Jobs by filter.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the project under which the job is created.

The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}&quot;, for example,
&quot;projects/api-test-project&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only.
      # 
      # Batch delete jobs request.
    &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The filter string specifies the jobs to be deleted.
        # 
        # Supported operator: =, AND
        # 
        # The fields eligible for filtering are:
        # 
        # * `companyName` (Required)
        # * `requisitionId` (Required)
        # 
        # Sample Query: companyName = &quot;projects/api-test-project/companies/123&quot; AND
        # requisitionId = &quot;req-1&quot;
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>

up to 5 minutes.

                  # sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
                  # &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
                  # address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the
                  # address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is
                  # used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and
                  # &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of

                  # of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the
                  # address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very

              # &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of

              # partially resolved.
              #
              # Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and

  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest.

This API call is intended for the use case of targeting passive job
seekers (for example, job seekers who have signed up to receive email
alerts about potential job opportunities), and has different algorithmic
adjustments that are targeted to passive job seekers.

This call constrains the visibility of jobs
present in the database, and only returns jobs the caller has
permission to search against.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the project to search within.

The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}&quot;, for example,
&quot;projects/api-test-project&quot;. (required)

        #
        # Meta information related to the job searcher or entity

        # performance of the service.
      &quot;sessionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique session identification string. A session is defined as the
          # duration of an end user&#x27;s interaction with the service over a certain

          #
          # If this field is not available for some reason, send &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;. Note
          # that any improvements to the model for a particular tenant
          # site, rely on this field being set correctly to some unique session_id.

          # The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
      &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The client-defined scope or source of the service call, which typically
          # is the domain on
          # which the service has been implemented and is currently being run.

          # For example, if the service is being run by client &lt;em&gt;Foo, Inc.&lt;/em&gt;, on
          # job board www.foo.com and career site www.bar.com, then this field is
          # set to &quot;foo.com&quot; for use on the job board, and &quot;bar.com&quot; for use on the
          # career site.

          # field being set correctly to a domain.

      &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique user identification string, as determined by the client.
