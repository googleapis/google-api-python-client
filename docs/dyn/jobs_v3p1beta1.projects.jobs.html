<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchDelete">batchDelete(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a list of Jobs by filter.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The resource name of the project under which the job is created.

The format is "projects/{project_id}", for example,
"projects/api-test-project". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only.
      # 
      # Batch delete jobs request.
    "filter": "A String", # Required.
        # 
        # The filter string specifies the jobs to be deleted.
        # 
        # Supported operator: =, AND
        # 
        # The fields eligible for filtering are:
        # 
        # * `companyName` (Required)
        # * `requisitionId` (Required)
        # 
        # Sample Query: companyName = "projects/api-test-project/companies/123" AND
        # requisitionId = "req-1"
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new job.

Typically, the job becomes searchable within 10 seconds, but it may take
up to 5 minutes.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The resource name of the project under which the job is created.

The format is "projects/{project_id}", for example,
"projects/api-test-project". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

                  # Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may
                  # sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
                  # "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
                  # address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the
                  # address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is

                  # "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of

                  # Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and

  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest.

This call constrains the visibility of jobs
present in the database, and only returns jobs that the caller has
permission to search against.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The resource name of the project to search within.

The format is "projects/{project_id}", for example,
"projects/api-test-project". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only.
      # 
      # The Request body of the `SearchJobs` call.
    "orderBy": "A String", # Optional.
        # 
        # The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Default is
        # "relevance desc".
        # 
        # Supported options are:
        # 
        # * "relevance desc": By relevance descending, as determined by the API
        # algorithms. Relevance thresholding of query results is only available
        # with this ordering.
        # * "posting`_`publish`_`time desc": By Job.posting_publish_time
        # descending.

  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest.

This API call is intended for the use case of targeting passive job
seekers (for example, job seekers who have signed up to receive email
alerts about potential job opportunities), and has different algorithmic
adjustments that are targeted to passive job seekers.

This call constrains the visibility of jobs
present in the database, and only returns jobs the caller has
permission to search against.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The resource name of the project to search within.

The format is "projects/{project_id}", for example,
"projects/api-test-project". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

        # Supported options are:
        # 
        # * "relevance desc": By relevance descending, as determined by the API
        # algorithms. Relevance thresholding of query results is only available
        # with this ordering.
        # * "posting`_`publish`_`time desc": By Job.posting_publish_time
        # descending.
        # * "posting`_`update`_`time desc": By Job.posting_update_time
        # descending.
        # * "title": By Job.title ascending.
        # * "title desc": By Job.title descending.
        # * "annualized`_`base`_`compensation": By job's
        # CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range ascending. Jobs
