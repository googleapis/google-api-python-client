  <pre>Updates the specified instance. Returns a long running operation which contains the updated instance in the response on completion.

Args:
  name: string, Output only. Instance resource name formatted as: `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/instances/[INSTANCE_ID]`. Name should not be populated when creating an instance since it is provided in the `instance_id` field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

}

  loggingEnabled: boolean, Deprecated, use instance.logging_enabled instead. Whether to enable Stackdriver logging for this instance.
  name1: string, Deprecated, use instance.Name instead. Name of the instance to update. Format: `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/instances/[INSTANCE_ID]`.
  updateMask: string, The update mask applies to instance. For the `FieldMask` definition, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#fieldmask If an empty update_mask is provided, only the non-default valued field in the worker pool field will be updated. Note that in order to update a field to the default value (zero, false, empty string) an explicit update_mask must be provided.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
