<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new instance in the specified region.
Returns a long running operation which contains an instance on completion.
While the long running operation is in progress, any call to `GetInstance`
returns an instance in state `CREATING`.

Args:
  parent: string, Resource name of the project containing the instance.
Format: `projects/[PROJECT_ID]`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request used for `CreateInstance`.
    "instanceId": "A String", # ID of the created instance.
        # A valid `instance_id` must:
        # be 6-50 characters long,
        # contain only lowercase letters, digits, hyphens and underscores,
        # start with a lowercase letter, and
        # end with a lowercase letter or a digit.
    "instance": { # Instance conceptually encapsulates all Remote Build Execution resources # Specifies the instance to create.
        # The name in the instance, if specified in the instance, is ignored.
        # for remote builds.
        # An instance consists of storage and compute resources (for example,
        # `ContentAddressableStorage`, `ActionCache`, `WorkerPools`) used for
        # running remote builds.
        # All Remote Build Execution API calls are scoped to an instance.
      "loggingEnabled": True or False, # Output only. Whether stack driver logging is enabled for the instance.
      "state": "A String", # Output only. State of the instance.
      "location": "A String", # The location is a GCP region. Currently only `us-central1` is supported.
      "name": "A String", # Output only. Instance resource name formatted as:
          # `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/instances/[INSTANCE_ID]`.
          # Name should not be populated when creating an instance since it is provided
          # in the `instance_id` field.
    },
    "parent": "A String", # Resource name of the project containing the instance.
        # Format: `projects/[PROJECT_ID]`.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  <pre>Deletes the specified instance.
Returns a long running operation which contains a `google.protobuf.Empty`

pools.
