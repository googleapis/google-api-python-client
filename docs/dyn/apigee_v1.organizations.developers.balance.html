  <pre>Adjust the prepaid balance for the developer. This API will be used in scenarios where the developer has been under-charged or over-charged.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Account balance for the developer. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}/developers/{developer}/balance` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for AdjustDeveloperBalance.
  &quot;adjustment&quot;: { # Represents an amount of money with its currency type. # * A positive value of `adjustment` means that that the API provider wishes to adjust the balance for an over-charged developer i.e. the balance of the developer will increase. * A negative value of `adjustment` means that that the API provider wishes to adjust the balance for an under-charged developer i.e. the balance of the developer will decrease.
    &quot;currencyCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The three-letter currency code defined in ISO 4217.
    &quot;nanos&quot;: 42, # Number of nano (10^-9) units of the amount. The value must be between -999,999,999 and +999,999,999 inclusive. If `units` is positive, `nanos` must be positive or zero. If `units` is zero, `nanos` can be positive, zero, or negative. If `units` is negative, `nanos` must be negative or zero. For example $-1.75 is represented as `units`=-1 and `nanos`=-750,000,000.
