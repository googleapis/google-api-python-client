It is also reported as part of a ScanRunErrorTrace message if scan validation fails due to a scan configuration error. # If the scan encounters SCAN_CONFIG_ISSUE error, this field has the error message encountered during scan configuration validation that is performed before each scan run.
      &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Indicates the reason code for a configuration failure.
      &quot;fieldName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Indicates the full name of the ScanConfig field that triggers this error, for example &quot;scan_config.max_qps&quot;. This field is provided for troubleshooting purposes only and its actual value can change in the future.
