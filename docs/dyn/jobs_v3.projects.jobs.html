<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchDelete">batchDelete(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a list of Jobs by filter.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the project under which the job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only. Batch delete jobs request.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The filter string specifies the jobs to be deleted. Supported operator: =, AND The fields eligible for filtering are: * `companyName` (Required) * `requisitionId` (Required) Sample Query: companyName = &quot;projects/api-test-project/companies/123&quot; AND requisitionId = &quot;req-1&quot;
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.

Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#x27;ReqA&#x27; becomes &#x27;ReqA-1&#x27;, &#x27;ReqA-2&#x27;, etc.) as multiple jobs with the same company_name, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage.

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
            &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
            &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.

    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.
    &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # Optional. The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.
      &quot;A String&quot;,

    &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
    &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
    &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
    &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
    &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
    &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
    &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
    &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Input only. Options for job processing. # Optional. Options for job processing.

Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.
    },
    &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
    &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
    &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
    &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The title of the job, such as &quot;Software Engineer&quot; The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.

In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.

          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

          ],
          &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
          &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
          &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).

For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 6.17 miles.
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.
  &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # Optional. The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;incentives&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.

  &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
  &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
  &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
  &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
  &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
  &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Input only. Options for job processing. # Optional. Options for job processing.
    &quot;disableStreetAddressResolution&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If set to `true`, the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job.
    &quot;htmlSanitization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.
  },
  &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
  &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
  &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The title of the job, such as &quot;Software Engineer&quot; The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.
  &quot;visibility&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Deprecated. The job is only visible to the owner. The visibility of the job. Defaults to Visibility.ACCOUNT_ONLY if not specified.

        },
        &quot;locationType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of a location, which corresponds to the address lines field of PostalAddress. For example, &quot;Downtown, Atlanta, GA, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#NEIGHBORHOOD, and &quot;Kansas City, KS, USA&quot; has a type of LocationType#LOCALITY.
        &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
          &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
          &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
          &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
          &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
          &quot;sublocality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.
        },
        &quot;radiusInMiles&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in miles of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng covers the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 6.17 miles.
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.
  &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # Optional. The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;incentives&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;jobBenefits&quot;: [ # Optional. The benefits included with the job.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;jobEndTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;jobLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The experience level associated with the job, such as &quot;Entry Level&quot;.
  &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
  &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
  &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
  &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
  &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
  &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Input only. Options for job processing. # Optional. Options for job processing.
    &quot;disableStreetAddressResolution&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If set to `true`, the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job.
    &quot;htmlSanitization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.
  },
  &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
  &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
  &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The title of the job, such as &quot;Software Engineer&quot; The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.
  &quot;visibility&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Deprecated. The job is only visible to the owner. The visibility of the job. Defaults to Visibility.ACCOUNT_ONLY if not specified.

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
              &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

              &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
              &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.

Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.

      &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
      &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
      &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
      &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
      &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
      &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.

Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.

      &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
      &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
      &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
      &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

            &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
            &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.

    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
    &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
    &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
    &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
    &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
    &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
    &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Input only. Options for job processing. # Optional. Options for job processing.

    &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
    &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
    &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
    &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.

        &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
          &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.

          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.

Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).

  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.

  &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
  &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
  &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
  &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
  &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
  &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Input only. Options for job processing. # Optional. Options for job processing.

Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.
  },
  &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
  &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
  &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The title of the job, such as &quot;Software Engineer&quot; The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="search">search(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest. This call constrains the visibility of jobs present in the database, and only returns jobs that the caller has permission to search against.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the project to search within. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only. The Request body of the `SearchJobs` call.
  &quot;disableKeywordMatch&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.job_title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.locations, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, the query &quot;program manager,&quot; a result is returned even if the job posting has the title &quot;software developer,&quot; which does not fall into &quot;program manager&quot; ontology, but does have &quot;program manager&quot; appearing in its description. For queries like &quot;cloud&quot; that does not contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with &quot;cloud&quot; keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag&#x27;s value. Please use Company.keyword_searchable_custom_fields or Company.keyword_searchable_custom_attributes if company specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values is needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false.
  &quot;diversificationLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified.
  &quot;enableBroadening&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false.
  &quot;histogramFacets&quot;: { # Input only. Histogram facets to be specified in SearchJobsRequest. # Optional. Histogram requests for jobs matching JobQuery.
    &quot;compensationHistogramFacets&quot;: [ # Optional. Specifies compensation field-based histogram requests. Duplicate values of CompensationHistogramRequest.type are not allowed.

              &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
                &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

                &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
                &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
                &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
                &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
                &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).

This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng covers the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 6.17 miles.
            },
          ],
        },
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.
        &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # Optional. The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.

        &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
        &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
        &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
        &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
        &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.

Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.
        },
        &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
        &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
        &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="searchForAlert">searchForAlert(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest. This API call is intended for the use case of targeting passive job seekers (for example, job seekers who have signed up to receive email alerts about potential job opportunities), and has different algorithmic adjustments that are targeted to passive job seekers. This call constrains the visibility of jobs present in the database, and only returns jobs the caller has permission to search against.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the project to search within. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only. The Request body of the `SearchJobs` call.
  &quot;disableKeywordMatch&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.job_title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.locations, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, the query &quot;program manager,&quot; a result is returned even if the job posting has the title &quot;software developer,&quot; which does not fall into &quot;program manager&quot; ontology, but does have &quot;program manager&quot; appearing in its description. For queries like &quot;cloud&quot; that does not contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with &quot;cloud&quot; keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag&#x27;s value. Please use Company.keyword_searchable_custom_fields or Company.keyword_searchable_custom_attributes if company specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values is needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false.
  &quot;diversificationLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified.
  &quot;enableBroadening&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false.

      &quot;allowImpreciseAddresses&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, jobs without &quot;precise&quot; addresses (street level addresses or GPS coordinates) might also be returned. For city and coarser level addresses, text matching is used. If this field is set to false or is not specified, only jobs that include precise addresses are returned by Commute Search. Note: If `allow_imprecise_addresses` is set to true, Commute Search is not able to calculate accurate commute times to jobs with city level and coarser address information. Jobs with imprecise addresses will return a `travel_duration` time of 0 regardless of distance from the job seeker.

      &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.

This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

                ],
                &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
                &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
                &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
                &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
                &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
                &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.
                  &quot;A String&quot;,
                ],
                &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See http://cldr.unicode.org/ and http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.
                &quot;revision&quot;: 42, # The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
                &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
                &quot;sublocality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.
              },
              &quot;radiusInMiles&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in miles of the job location. This value is derived from the location bounding box in which a circle with the specified radius centered from LatLng covers the area associated with the job location. For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 6.17 miles.
            },
          ],
        },
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.
        &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # Optional. The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;incentives&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
        &quot;jobBenefits&quot;: [ # Optional. The benefits included with the job.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;jobEndTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;jobLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The experience level associated with the job, such as &quot;Entry Level&quot;.
        &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;, for example, &quot;projects/api-test-project/jobs/1234&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
        &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
        &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional but strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be deleted or listed by the DeleteJob and ListJobs APIs, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company_name, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job will be treated as expired immediately. If this value is not provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value is not provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include expiry_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
        &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
        &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
        &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Input only. Options for job processing. # Optional. Options for job processing.
          &quot;disableStreetAddressResolution&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If set to `true`, the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job.
          &quot;htmlSanitization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation is not disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.
        },
        &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # Optional. A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
        &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
        &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job is not allowed to be created if there is another job with the same [company_name], language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
        &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The title of the job, such as &quot;Software Engineer&quot; The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.
        &quot;visibility&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Deprecated. The job is only visible to the owner. The visibility of the job. Defaults to Visibility.ACCOUNT_ONLY if not specified.

      &quot;jobTitleSnippet&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Contains snippets of text from the Job.job_title field most closely matching a search query&#x27;s keywords, if available. The matching query keywords are enclosed in HTML bold tags.
      &quot;searchTextSnippet&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Contains snippets of text from the Job.description and similar fields that most closely match a search query&#x27;s keywords, if available. All HTML tags in the original fields are stripped when returned in this field, and matching query keywords are enclosed in HTML bold tags.
