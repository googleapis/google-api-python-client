<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchDelete">batchDelete(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a list of Jobs by filter.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The resource name of the project under which the job is created.

The format is "projects/{project_id}", for example,
"projects/api-test-project". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only.
      # 
      # Batch delete jobs request.
    "filter": "A String", # Required.
        # 
        # The filter string specifies the jobs to be deleted.
        # 
        # Supported operator: =, AND
        # 
        # The fields eligible for filtering are:
        # 
        # * `companyName` (Required)
        # * `requisitionId` (Required)
        # 
        # Sample Query: companyName = "projects/api-test-project/companies/123" AND
        # requisitionId = "req-1"
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new job.

Typically, the job becomes searchable within 10 seconds, but it may take
up to 5 minutes.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The resource name of the project under which the job is created.

The format is "projects/{project_id}", for example,
"projects/api-test-project". (required)

                  # sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
                  # "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
                  # address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the
                  # address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is

                  # "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of

                  # Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and

  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest.

This call constrains the visibility of jobs
present in the database, and only returns jobs that the caller has
permission to search against.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The resource name of the project to search within.

The format is "projects/{project_id}", for example,
"projects/api-test-project". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only.
      # 
      # The Request body of the `SearchJobs` call.
    "orderBy": "A String", # Optional.
        # 
        # The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Default is
        # "relevance desc".
        # 
        # Supported options are:
        # 
        # * "relevance desc": By relevance descending, as determined by the API
        # algorithms. Relevance thresholding of query results is only available
        # with this ordering.
        # * "posting`_`publish`_`time desc": By Job.posting_publish_time
        # descending.
        # * "posting`_`update`_`time desc": By Job.posting_update_time
        # descending.
        # * "title": By Job.title ascending.
        # * "title desc": By Job.title descending.
        # * "annualized`_`base`_`compensation": By job's
        # CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range ascending. Jobs
        # whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of
        # search results.

  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest.

This API call is intended for the use case of targeting passive job
seekers (for example, job seekers who have signed up to receive email
alerts about potential job opportunities), and has different algorithmic
adjustments that are targeted to passive job seekers.

This call constrains the visibility of jobs
present in the database, and only returns jobs the caller has
permission to search against.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The resource name of the project to search within.

The format is "projects/{project_id}", for example,
"projects/api-test-project". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Input only.
      # 
      # The Request body of the `SearchJobs` call.
    "orderBy": "A String", # Optional.
        # 
        # The criteria determining how search results are sorted. Default is
        # "relevance desc".
        # 
        # Supported options are:
        # 
        # * "relevance desc": By relevance descending, as determined by the API
        # algorithms. Relevance thresholding of query results is only available
        # with this ordering.
        # * "posting`_`publish`_`time desc": By Job.posting_publish_time
        # descending.
        # * "posting`_`update`_`time desc": By Job.posting_update_time
        # descending.
        # * "title": By Job.title ascending.
        # * "title desc": By Job.title descending.
        # * "annualized`_`base`_`compensation": By job's
        # CompensationInfo.annualized_base_compensation_range ascending. Jobs
        # whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of
        # search results.
        # * "annualized`_`base`_`compensation desc": By job's

        # CompensationInfo.annualized_total_compensation_range descending. Jobs
        # whose annualized base compensation is unspecified are put at the end of
        # search results.
    "diversificationLevel": "A String", # Optional.
        # 
        # Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in
        # the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on
        # their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are
        # clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is
        # displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs
        # being displayed lower down in the results.
        # 
        # Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value
        # is specified.
    "disableKeywordMatch": True or False, # Optional.

        # Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.job_title,
        # Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.locations,
        # Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a
        # keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when
        # there are matching keywords. For example, the query "program manager," a
        # result is returned even if the job posting has the title "software
        # developer," which does not fall into "program manager" ontology, but does
        # have "program manager" appearing in its description.
        # 
        # For queries like "cloud" that does not contain title or
        # location specific ontology, jobs with "cloud" keyword matches are returned
        # regardless of this flag's value.
        # 
        # Please use Company.keyword_searchable_custom_fields or
        # Company.keyword_searchable_custom_attributes if company specific
        # globally matched custom field/attribute string values is needed. Enabling
        # keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests.

      "disableSpellCheck": True or False, # Optional.
          #
          # This flag controls the spell-check feature. If false, the
