Each resource type&#x27;s `parent` value format is described below: * [`projects.roles.create()`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles/create): `projects/{PROJECT_ID}`. This method creates project-level [custom roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles). Example request URL: `https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/roles` * [`organizations.roles.create()`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles/create): `organizations/{ORGANIZATION_ID}`.
