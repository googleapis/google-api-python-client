<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="start">start(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts a node.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for StartNode.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
