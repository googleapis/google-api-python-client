  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The immutable name of the TPU
  &quot;acceleratorType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of hardware accelerators associated with this node.
      # Required.

      # The network port for the TPU Node as visible to Compute Engine instances.
  &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The service account used to run the tensor flow services within the node.
      # To share resources, including Google Cloud Storage data, with the
      # Tensorflow job running in the Node, this account must have permissions to
