<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new BrowserDlpRule in a given organization and PartnerTenant.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the BrowserDlpRule parent using the form: `organizations/{organization_id}/locations/global/partnerTenants/{partner_tenant_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Browser DLP Rule for a PartnerTenant
  &quot;group&quot;: { # Message to capture group information # Required. The group to which this Rule should be applied to.
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The group email id
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Google group id
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Unique resource name. The name is ignored when creating BrowserDlpRule.
  &quot;ruleSetting&quot;: { # Message to capture settings for a BrowserDlpRule # Required. The policy settings to apply.
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The type of the Setting. .
    &quot;value&quot;: { # Required. The value of the Setting.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object.
    },
  },
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
