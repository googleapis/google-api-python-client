  imageImportId: string, Required. The image import identifier. This value maximum length is 63 characters, and valid characters are /a-z-/. It must start with an english letter and must not end with a hyphen.
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a single ImageImport.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The ImageImport name. (required)
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists ImageImports in a given project.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent, which owns this collection of targets. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. The filter request (according to https://google.aip.dev/160).
  orderBy: string, Optional. The order by fields for the result (according to https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering). Currently ordering is only possible by &quot;name&quot; field.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of targets to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 500 targets will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListImageImports` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListImageImports` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
