<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(courseStates=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, studentId=None, teacherId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns a list of courses that the requesting user is permitted to view, restricted to those that match the request. Returned courses are ordered by creation time, with the most recently created coming first. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` for access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the query argument is malformed. * `NOT_FOUND` if any users specified in the query arguments do not exist.

Args:
  courseStates: string, Restricts returned courses to those in one of the specified states The default value is ACTIVE, ARCHIVED, PROVISIONED, DECLINED. (repeated)
    Allowed values
      COURSE_STATE_UNSPECIFIED - No course state. No returned Course message will use this value.
      ACTIVE - The course is active.
      ARCHIVED - The course has been archived. You cannot modify it except to change it to a different state.
      PROVISIONED - The course has been created, but not yet activated. It is accessible by the primary teacher and domain administrators, who may modify it or change it to the `ACTIVE` or `DECLINED` states. A course may only be changed to `PROVISIONED` if it is in the `DECLINED` state.
      DECLINED - The course has been created, but declined. It is accessible by the course owner and domain administrators, though it will not be displayed in the web UI. You cannot modify the course except to change it to the `PROVISIONED` state. A course may only be changed to `DECLINED` if it is in the `PROVISIONED` state.
      SUSPENDED - The course has been suspended. You cannot modify the course, and only the user identified by the `owner_id` can view the course. A course may be placed in this state if it potentially violates the Terms of Service.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of items to return. Zero or unspecified indicates that the server may assign a maximum. The server may return fewer than the specified number of results.
  pageToken: string, nextPageToken value returned from a previous list call, indicating that the subsequent page of results should be returned. The list request must be otherwise identical to the one that resulted in this token.
  studentId: string, Restricts returned courses to those having a student with the specified identifier. The identifier can be one of the following: * the numeric identifier for the user * the email address of the user * the string literal `&quot;me&quot;`, indicating the requesting user
  teacherId: string, Restricts returned courses to those having a teacher with the specified identifier. The identifier can be one of the following: * the numeric identifier for the user * the email address of the user * the string literal `&quot;me&quot;`, indicating the requesting user
