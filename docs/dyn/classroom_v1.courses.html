  updateMask: string, Mask that identifies which fields on the course to update.
This field is required to do an update. The update will fail if invalid
fields are specified. The following fields are valid:

* `name`
* `section`
* `descriptionHeading`
* `description`
* `room`
* `courseState`
* `ownerId`

Note: patches to ownerId are treated as being effective immediately, but in
practice it may take some time for the ownership transfer of all affected
resources to complete.

When set in a query parameter, this field should be specified as

`updateMask=<field1>,<field2>,...`
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
