Args:
  endpoint: string, Required. The name of the Endpoint resource into which to deploy a Model. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/endpoints/{endpoint}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for EndpointService.DeployModel.
  &quot;deployedModel&quot;: { # A deployment of a Model. Endpoints contain one or more DeployedModels. # Required. The DeployedModel to be created within the Endpoint. Note that Endpoint.traffic_split must be updated for the DeployedModel to start receiving traffic, either as part of this call, or via EndpointService.UpdateEndpoint.

If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, a no upper bound for scaling under heavy traffic will be assume, though Vertex AI may be unable to scale beyond certain replica number.
      &quot;minReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The minimum number of replicas this DeployedModel will be always deployed on. If traffic against it increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas up to max_replica_count, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.

The metric specifications that overrides a resource utilization metric (CPU utilization, accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle, and so on) target value (default to 60 if not set). At most one entry is allowed per metric.

The default target value is 60 for both metrics. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target value 60 if not explicitly set. For example, in the case of Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU utilization to 80, you should set autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization` and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to `80`.

For best results the recommended value is about 10% - 20% of the standard deviation of the input feature. Refer to section 3.2 of the SmoothGrad paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf. Defaults to 0.1. If the distribution is different per feature, set feature_noise_sigma instead for each feature.

  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
