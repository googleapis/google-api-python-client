This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE.

This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE
                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the information type. Either a name of your choosing when creating a CustomInfoType, or one of the names listed at https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference when specifying a built-in type. When sending Cloud DLP results to Data Catalog, infoType names should conform to the pattern `[A-Za-z0-9$-_]{1,64}`.

This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE.

This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

For example, the dictionary word &quot;jen&quot; will match the first three letters of the text &quot;jen123&quot; but will return no matches for &quot;jennifer&quot;. Dictionary words containing a large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in unexpected findings because such characters are treated as whitespace. The [limits](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/limits) page contains details about the size limits of dictionaries. For dictionaries that do not fit within these constraints, consider using `LargeCustomDictionaryConfig` in the `StoredInfoType` API. # Dictionary which defines the rule.

One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE.

This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either - reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier - be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE.

This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE
                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the information type.

If the bound Value type differs from the type of data being transformed, we will first attempt converting the type of the data to be transformed to match the type of the bound before comparing. See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/concepts-bucketing to learn more. # Fixed size bucketing

So if `lower_bound` = 10, `upper_bound` = 89, and `bucket_size` = 10, then the following buckets would be used: -10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-89, 89+. Precision up to 2 decimals works.

For example, if &#x27;integer_value&#x27; is set to 123456789, the number of bytes would be counted as 9, even though an int64 only holds up to 8 bytes of data. # Required. Lower bound value of buckets. All values less than `lower_bound` are grouped together into a single bucket; for example if `lower_bound` = 10, then all values less than 10 are replaced with the value &quot;-10&quot;.
