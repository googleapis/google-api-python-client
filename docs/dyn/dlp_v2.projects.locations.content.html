When no InfoTypes or CustomInfoTypes are specified in this request, the
system will automatically choose what detectors to run. By default this may
be all types, but may change over time as detectors are updated.

Args:

  locationId: string, The geographic location to process de-identification. Reserved for future
extensions. (required)
