<p class="firstline">Adds Firebase resources to the specified existing [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) `Project`] (https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects). Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP `Project`, a `FirebaseProject` has the same underlying GCP identifiers (`projectNumber` and `projectId`). This allows for easy interop with Google APIs. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to a FirebaseProject; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. This method does not modify any billing account information on the underlying GCP `Project`. To call `AddFirebase`, a project member or service account must have the following permissions (the IAM roles of Editor and Owner contain these permissions): `firebase.projects.update`, `resourcemanager.projects.get`, `serviceusage.services.enable`, and `serviceusage.services.get`.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#addGoogleAnalytics">addGoogleAnalytics(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Links the specified FirebaseProject with an existing [Google Analytics account](http://www.google.com/analytics/). Using this call, you can either: - Specify an `analyticsAccountId` to provision a new Google Analytics property within the specified account and associate the new property with the `FirebaseProject`. - Specify an existing `analyticsPropertyId` to associate the property with the `FirebaseProject`. Note that when you call `AddGoogleAnalytics`: 1. The first check determines if any existing data streams in the Google Analytics property correspond to any existing Firebase Apps in the `FirebaseProject` (based on the `packageName` or `bundleId` associated with the data stream). Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property. Learn more about the hierarchy and structure of Google Analytics accounts in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9303323). The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to an AnalyticsDetails; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. To call `AddGoogleAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the existing `FirebaseProject` and have the [`Edit` permission](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) for the Google Analytics account. If the `FirebaseProject` already has Google Analytics enabled, and you call `AddGoogleAnalytics` using an `analyticsPropertyId` that's different from the currently associated property, then the call will fail. Analytics may have already been enabled in the Firebase console or by specifying `timeZone` and `regionCode` in the call to [`AddFirebase`](../../v1beta1/projects/addFirebase).</p>

  <pre>Lists each FirebaseProject accessible to the caller. The elements are returned in no particular order, but they will be a consistent view of the Projects when additional requests are made with a `pageToken`. This method is eventually consistent with Project mutations, which means newly provisioned Projects and recent modifications to existing Projects might not be reflected in the set of Projects. The list will include only ACTIVE Projects. Use GetFirebaseProject for consistent reads as well as for additional Project details.

Args:
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of Projects to return in the response. The server may return fewer than this at its discretion. If no value is specified (or too large a value is specified), the server will impose its own limit. This value cannot be negative.

  <pre>Unlinks the specified FirebaseProject from its Google Analytics account. This call removes the association of the specified `FirebaseProject` with its current Google Analytics property.

For Android Apps and iOS Apps, this call re-links data streams with their corresponding apps. However, for Web Apps, this call provisions a *new* data stream for each Web App. To call `RemoveAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the `FirebaseProject`.
