Args:
  app: string, Required. The relative resource name of the iOS app, in the format: ``` projects/{project_number}/apps/{app_id} ``` If necessary, the `project_number` element can be replaced with the project ID of the Firebase project. Learn more about using project identifiers in Google&#x27;s [AIP 2510](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510) standard. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the ExchangeAppAttestAssertion method.
  &quot;artifact&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The artifact returned by a previous call to ExchangeAppAttestAttestation.
  &quot;assertion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The CBOR-encoded assertion returned by the client-side App Attest API.
  &quot;challenge&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A one-time challenge returned by an immediately prior call to GenerateAppAttestChallenge.
  &quot;limitedUse&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether this attestation is for use in a *limited use* (`true`) or *session based* (`false`) context. To enable this attestation to be used with the *replay protection* feature, set this to `true`. The default value is `false`.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Encapsulates an *App Check token*, which are used to access Firebase services protected by App Check.
  &quot;attestationToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An App Check token. App Check tokens are signed [JWTs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) containing claims that identify the attested app and Firebase project. This token is used to access Firebase services protected by App Check.

  &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The duration from the time this token is minted until its expiration. This field is intended to ease client-side token management, since the client may have clock skew, but is still able to accurately measure a duration.
