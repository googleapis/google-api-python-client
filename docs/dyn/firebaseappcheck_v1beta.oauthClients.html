  <pre>Accepts an App Attest assertion and an artifact previously obtained from ExchangeAppAttestAttestation and verifies those with Apple. If valid, returns an AppCheckToken.

Args:
  app: string, Required. The relative resource name of the iOS app, in the format: ``` projects/{project_number}/apps/{app_id} ``` If necessary, the `project_number` element can be replaced with the project ID of the Firebase project. Learn more about using project identifiers in Google&#x27;s [AIP 2510](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510) standard. Alternatively, if this method is being called for an OAuth client protected by App Check, this field can also be in the format: ``` oauthClients/{oauth_client_id} ``` You can view the OAuth client ID for your OAuth clients in the Google Cloud console. Note that only iOS OAuth clients are supported at this time, and they must be linked to corresponding iOS Firebase apps. Please see [the documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/appcheck/get-started#project-setup) for more information. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the ExchangeAppAttestAssertion method.
  &quot;artifact&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The artifact returned by a previous call to ExchangeAppAttestAttestation.
  &quot;assertion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The CBOR-encoded assertion returned by the client-side App Attest API.
  &quot;challenge&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A one-time challenge returned by an immediately prior call to GenerateAppAttestChallenge.
  &quot;limitedUse&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether this attestation is for use in a *limited use* (`true`) or *session based* (`false`) context. To enable this attestation to be used with the *replay protection* feature, set this to `true`. The default value is `false`.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

  &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The duration from the time this token is minted until its expiration. This field is intended to ease client-side token management, since the client may have clock skew, but is still able to accurately measure a duration.
