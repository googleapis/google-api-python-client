Node pools are a set of nodes (i.e. VM&#x27;s), with a common configuration and specification, under the control of the cluster master. They may have a set of Kubernetes labels applied to them, which may be used to reference them during pod scheduling. They may also be resized up or down, to accommodate the workload. These upgrade settings control the level of parallelism and the level of disruption caused by an upgrade. maxUnavailable controls the number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable. maxSurge controls the number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool temporarily for the time of the upgrade to increase the number of available nodes. (maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many nodes are being upgraded at the same time). Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to be moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.) Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time.

Eg, if you wanted to have a 9-5 UTC-4 window every weekday, you&#x27;d use something like: ``` start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400 end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400 recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR ``` Windows can span multiple days. Eg, to make the window encompass every weekend from midnight Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC: ``` start time = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z end time = 2019-01-07T23:59:00Z recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA ``` Note the start and end time&#x27;s specific dates are largely arbitrary except to specify duration of the window and when it first starts.

Node pools are a set of nodes (i.e. VM&#x27;s), with a common configuration and specification, under the control of the cluster master. They may have a set of Kubernetes labels applied to them, which may be used to reference them during pod scheduling. They may also be resized up or down, to accommodate the workload. These upgrade settings control the level of parallelism and the level of disruption caused by an upgrade. maxUnavailable controls the number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable. maxSurge controls the number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool temporarily for the time of the upgrade to increase the number of available nodes. (maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many nodes are being upgraded at the same time). Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to be moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.) Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time. This ensures that there are always at least 4 nodes available.

Eg, if you wanted to have a 9-5 UTC-4 window every weekday, you&#x27;d use something like: ``` start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400 end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400 recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR ``` Windows can span multiple days. Eg, to make the window encompass every weekend from midnight Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC: ``` start time = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z end time = 2019-01-07T23:59:00Z recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA ``` Note the start and end time&#x27;s specific dates are largely arbitrary except to specify duration of the window and when it first starts.

Node pools are a set of nodes (i.e. VM&#x27;s), with a common configuration and specification, under the control of the cluster master. They may have a set of Kubernetes labels applied to them, which may be used to reference them during pod scheduling. They may also be resized up or down, to accommodate the workload. These upgrade settings control the level of parallelism and the level of disruption caused by an upgrade. maxUnavailable controls the number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable. maxSurge controls the number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool temporarily for the time of the upgrade to increase the number of available nodes. (maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how many nodes are being upgraded at the same time). Note: upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to be moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0, this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits of PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.) Consider a hypothetical node pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means the upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes simultaneously. It creates 2 additional (upgraded) nodes, then it brings down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at the same time. This ensures that there are always at least 4 nodes available.

Args:
  name: string, The name (project, location, cluster name) of the cluster to set maintenance policy. Specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*/clusters/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # SetMaintenancePolicyRequest sets the maintenance policy for a cluster.
  &quot;clusterId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the cluster to update.
  &quot;maintenancePolicy&quot;: { # MaintenancePolicy defines the maintenance policy to be used for the cluster. # Required. The maintenance policy to be set for the cluster. An empty field clears the existing maintenance policy.
    &quot;resourceVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A hash identifying the version of this policy, so that updates to fields of the policy won&#x27;t accidentally undo intermediate changes (and so that users of the API unaware of some fields won&#x27;t accidentally remove other fields). Make a `get()` request to the cluster to get the current resource version and include it with requests to set the policy.
    &quot;window&quot;: { # MaintenanceWindow defines the maintenance window to be used for the cluster. # Specifies the maintenance window in which maintenance may be performed.
      &quot;dailyMaintenanceWindow&quot;: { # Time window specified for daily maintenance operations. # DailyMaintenanceWindow specifies a daily maintenance operation window.

They go on for the span of time between the start and end time. For example, to have something repeat every weekday, you&#x27;d use: `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR` To repeat some window daily (equivalent to the DailyMaintenanceWindow): `FREQ=DAILY` For the first weekend of every month: `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=1;BYDAY=SA,SU` This specifies how frequently the window starts. Eg, if you wanted to have a 9-5 UTC-4 window every weekday, you&#x27;d use something like: ``` start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400 end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400 recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR ``` Windows can span multiple days. Eg, to make the window encompass every weekend from midnight Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC: ``` start time = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z end time = 2019-01-07T23:59:00Z recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA ``` Note the start and end time&#x27;s specific dates are largely arbitrary except to specify duration of the window and when it first starts. The FREQ values of HOURLY, MINUTELY, and SECONDLY are not supported.
        &quot;window&quot;: { # Represents an arbitrary window of time. # The window of the first recurrence.
          &quot;endTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time that the window ends. The end time should take place after the start time.
