  <pre>Gets multiple documents.

Documents returned by this method are not guaranteed to be returned in the
same order that they were requested.

Args:
  database: string, Required. The database name. In the format:
`projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

        # `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`.

    &quot;newTransaction&quot;: { # Options for creating a new transaction. # Starts a new transaction and reads the documents.
        # Defaults to a read-only transaction.

        # not be returned in the response.
        # Used to restrict a get or update operation on a document to a subset of its
        # fields.
        # This is different from standard field masks, as this is always scoped to a
        # Document, and takes in account the dynamic nature of Value.
