  <pre>Gets multiple documents. Documents returned by this method are not guaranteed to be returned in the same order that they were requested.

Args:
  database: string, Required. The database name. In the format: `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for Firestore.BatchGetDocuments.
  &quot;documents&quot;: [ # The names of the documents to retrieve. In the format: `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`. The request will fail if any of the document is not a child resource of the given `database`. Duplicate names will be elided.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;mask&quot;: { # A set of field paths on a document. Used to restrict a get or update operation on a document to a subset of its fields. This is different from standard field masks, as this is always scoped to a Document, and takes in account the dynamic nature of Value. # The fields to return. If not set, returns all fields. If a document has a field that is not present in this mask, that field will not be returned in the response.
    &quot;fieldPaths&quot;: [ # The list of field paths in the mask. See Document.fields for a field path syntax reference.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;newTransaction&quot;: { # Options for creating a new transaction. # Starts a new transaction and reads the documents. Defaults to a read-only transaction. The new transaction ID will be returned as the first response in the stream.
    &quot;readOnly&quot;: { # Options for a transaction that can only be used to read documents. # The transaction can only be used for read operations.
      &quot;readTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Reads documents at the given time. This must be a microsecond precision timestamp within the past one hour, or if Point-in-Time Recovery is enabled, can additionally be a whole minute timestamp within the past 7 days.
    },
    &quot;readWrite&quot;: { # Options for a transaction that can be used to read and write documents. Firestore does not allow 3rd party auth requests to create read-write. transactions. # The transaction can be used for both read and write operations.
      &quot;retryTransaction&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An optional transaction to retry.
    },
  },
  &quot;readTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Reads documents as they were at the given time. This must be a microsecond precision timestamp within the past one hour, or if Point-in-Time Recovery is enabled, can additionally be a whole minute timestamp within the past 7 days.
  &quot;transaction&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Reads documents in a transaction.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The streamed response for Firestore.BatchGetDocuments.
  &quot;found&quot;: { # A Firestore document. Must not exceed 1 MiB - 4 bytes. # A document that was requested.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the document was created. This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query.
    &quot;fields&quot;: { # The document&#x27;s fields. The map keys represent field names. Field names matching the regular expression `__.*__` are reserved. Reserved field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The field names, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be empty. Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by a dot-delimited (`.`) string of segments. Each segment is either a simple field name (defined below) or a quoted field name. For example, the structured field `&quot;foo&quot; : { map_value: { &quot;x&amp;y&quot; : { string_value: &quot;hello&quot; }}}` would be represented by the field path `` foo.`x&amp;y` ``. A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example, `foo_bar_17`. A quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be escaped using a `\`. For example, `` `x&amp;y` `` represents `x&amp;y` and `` `bak\`tik` `` represents `` bak`tik ``.

    <code class="details" id="partitionQuery">partitionQuery(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Partitions a query by returning partition cursors that can be used to run the query in parallel. The returned partition cursors are split points that can be used by RunQuery as starting/end points for the query results.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource name. In the format: `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents`. Document resource names are not supported; only database resource names can be specified. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for Firestore.PartitionQuery.
  &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of partitions to return in this call, subject to `partition_count`. For example, if `partition_count` = 10 and `page_size` = 8, the first call to PartitionQuery will return up to 8 partitions and a `next_page_token` if more results exist. A second call to PartitionQuery will return up to 2 partitions, to complete the total of 10 specified in `partition_count`.
  &quot;pageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The `next_page_token` value returned from a previous call to PartitionQuery that may be used to get an additional set of results. There are no ordering guarantees between sets of results. Thus, using multiple sets of results will require merging the different result sets. For example, two subsequent calls using a page_token may return: * cursor B, cursor M, cursor Q * cursor A, cursor U, cursor W To obtain a complete result set ordered with respect to the results of the query supplied to PartitionQuery, the results sets should be merged: cursor A, cursor B, cursor M, cursor Q, cursor U, cursor W

For example, the structured field `&quot;foo&quot; : { map_value: { &quot;x&amp;y&quot; : { string_value: &quot;hello&quot; }}}` would be represented by the field path `` foo.`x&amp;y` ``. A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example, `foo_bar_17`. A quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be escaped using a `\`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="write">write(database, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Streams batches of document updates and deletes, in order. This method is only available via gRPC or WebChannel (not REST).

Args:
  database: string, Required. The database name. In the format: `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}`. This is only required in the first message. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for Firestore.Write. The first request creates a stream, or resumes an existing one from a token. When creating a new stream, the server replies with a response containing only an ID and a token, to use in the next request. When resuming a stream, the server first streams any responses later than the given token, then a response containing only an up-to-date token, to use in the next request.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Labels associated with this write request.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;streamId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID of the write stream to resume. This may only be set in the first message. When left empty, a new write stream will be created.
  &quot;streamToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A stream token that was previously sent by the server. The client should set this field to the token from the most recent WriteResponse it has received. This acknowledges that the client has received responses up to this token. After sending this token, earlier tokens may not be used anymore. The server may close the stream if there are too many unacknowledged responses. Leave this field unset when creating a new stream. To resume a stream at a specific point, set this field and the `stream_id` field. Leave this field unset when creating a new stream.
  &quot;writes&quot;: [ # The writes to apply. Always executed atomically and in order. This must be empty on the first request. This may be empty on the last request. This must not be empty on all other requests.
    { # A write on a document.

        &quot;exists&quot;: True or False, # When set to `true`, the target document must exist. When set to `false`, the target document must not exist.
        &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # When set, the target document must exist and have been last updated at that time. Timestamp must be microsecond aligned.
      },
