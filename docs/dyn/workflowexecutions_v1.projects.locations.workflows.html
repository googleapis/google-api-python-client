  <pre>Triggers a new execution using the latest revision of the given workflow by a Pub/Sub push notification.

Args:
  workflow: string, Required. Name of the workflow for which an execution should be created. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workflows/{workflow} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the TriggerPubsubExecution method.
  &quot;GCPCloudEventsMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. LINT: LEGACY_NAMES The query parameter value for __GCP_CloudEventsMode, set by the Eventarc service when configuring triggers.
  &quot;message&quot;: { # A message that is published by publishers and consumed by subscribers. The message must contain either a non-empty data field or at least one attribute. Note that client libraries represent this object differently depending on the language. See the corresponding [client library documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries) for more information. See [quotas and limits] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/quotas) for more information about message limits. # Required. The message of the Pub/Sub push notification.
    &quot;attributes&quot;: { # Attributes for this message. If this field is empty, the message must contain non-empty data. This can be used to filter messages on the subscription.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
    &quot;data&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The message data field. If this field is empty, the message must contain at least one attribute.
    &quot;messageId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # ID of this message, assigned by the server when the message is published. Guaranteed to be unique within the topic. This value may be read by a subscriber that receives a `PubsubMessage` via a `Pull` call or a push delivery. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.
    &quot;orderingKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If non-empty, identifies related messages for which publish order should be respected. If a `Subscription` has `enable_message_ordering` set to `true`, messages published with the same non-empty `ordering_key` value will be delivered to subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. All `PubsubMessage`s published in a given `PublishRequest` must specify the same `ordering_key` value. For more information, see [ordering messages](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering).
    &quot;publishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time at which the message was published, populated by the server when it receives the `Publish` call. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.
  },
  &quot;subscription&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The subscription of the Pub/Sub push notification. Format: projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  &quot;argument&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Input parameters of the execution represented as a JSON string. The size limit is 32KB. *Note*: If you are using the REST API directly to run your workflow, you must escape any JSON string value of `argument`. Example: `&#x27;{&quot;argument&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;firstName\&quot;:\&quot;FIRST\&quot;,\&quot;lastName\&quot;:\&quot;LAST\&quot;}&quot;}&#x27;`
  &quot;callLogLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The call logging level associated to this execution.

    &quot;currentSteps&quot;: [ # A list of currently executing or last executed step names for the workflow execution currently running. If the workflow has succeeded or failed, this is the last attempted or executed step. Presently, if the current step is inside a subworkflow, the list only includes that step. In the future, the list will contain items for each step in the call stack, starting with the outermost step in the `main` subworkflow, and ending with the most deeply nested step.
      { # Represents a step of the workflow this execution is running.
        &quot;routine&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of a routine within the workflow.
