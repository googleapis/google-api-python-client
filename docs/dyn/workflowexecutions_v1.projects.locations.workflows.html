  <pre>Triggers a new execution using the latest revision of the given workflow by a Pub/Sub push notification.

Args:
  workflow: string, Required. Name of the workflow for which an execution should be created. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workflows/{workflow} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the TriggerPubsubExecution method.
  &quot;GCPCloudEventsMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. LINT: LEGACY_NAMES The query parameter value for __GCP_CloudEventsMode, set by the Eventarc service when configuring triggers.
  &quot;message&quot;: { # A message that is published by publishers and consumed by subscribers. The message must contain either a non-empty data field or at least one attribute. Note that client libraries represent this object differently depending on the language. See the corresponding [client library documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries) for more information. See [quotas and limits] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/quotas) for more information about message limits. # Required. The message of the Pub/Sub push notification.
    &quot;attributes&quot;: { # Attributes for this message. If this field is empty, the message must contain non-empty data. This can be used to filter messages on the subscription.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
    &quot;data&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The message data field. If this field is empty, the message must contain at least one attribute.
    &quot;messageId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # ID of this message, assigned by the server when the message is published. Guaranteed to be unique within the topic. This value may be read by a subscriber that receives a `PubsubMessage` via a `Pull` call or a push delivery. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.
    &quot;orderingKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If non-empty, identifies related messages for which publish order should be respected. If a `Subscription` has `enable_message_ordering` set to `true`, messages published with the same non-empty `ordering_key` value will be delivered to subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. All `PubsubMessage`s published in a given `PublishRequest` must specify the same `ordering_key` value. For more information, see [ordering messages](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering).
    &quot;publishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time at which the message was published, populated by the server when it receives the `Publish` call. It must not be populated by the publisher in a `Publish` call.
  },
  &quot;subscription&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The subscription of the Pub/Sub push notification. Format: projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
