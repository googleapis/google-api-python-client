      },
      &quot;workerLifecycleEvent&quot;: { # A report of an event in a worker&#x27;s lifecycle. The proto contains one event, because the worker is expected to asynchronously send each message immediately after the event. Due to this asynchrony, messages may arrive out of order (or missing), and it is up to the consumer to interpret. The timestamp of the event is in the enclosing WorkerMessage proto. # Record of worker lifecycle events.
        &quot;containerStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The start time of this container. All events will report this so that events can be grouped together across container/VM restarts.
        &quot;event&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The event being reported.

The service will take care of translating these into user understandable messages if necessary. Example use cases: 1. Worker processes reporting successful startup. 2. Worker processes reporting specific errors (e.g. package staging failure). # A worker message code.
        &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The code is a string intended for consumption by a machine that identifies the type of message being sent. Examples: 1. &quot;HARNESS_STARTED&quot; might be used to indicate the worker harness has started. 2. &quot;GCS_DOWNLOAD_ERROR&quot; might be used to indicate an error downloading a Cloud Storage file as part of the boot process of one of the worker containers. This is a string and not an enum to make it easy to add new codes without waiting for an API change.
        &quot;parameters&quot;: { # Parameters contains specific information about the code. This is a struct to allow parameters of different types. Examples: 1. For a &quot;HARNESS_STARTED&quot; message parameters might provide the name of the worker and additional data like timing information. 2. For a &quot;GCS_DOWNLOAD_ERROR&quot; parameters might contain fields listing the Cloud Storage objects being downloaded and fields containing errors. In general complex data structures should be avoided. If a worker needs to send a specific and complicated data structure then please consider defining a new proto and adding it to the data oneof in WorkerMessageResponse. Conventions: Parameters should only be used for information that isn&#x27;t typically passed as a label. hostname and other worker identifiers should almost always be passed as labels since they will be included on most messages.
