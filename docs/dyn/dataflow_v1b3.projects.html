<h3>Method Details</h3>

  <pre>Send a worker_message to the service.

Args:
  projectId: string, The project to send the WorkerMessages to. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request for sending worker messages to the service.
    "workerMessages": [ # The WorkerMessages to send.
      { # WorkerMessage provides information to the backend about a worker.
        "workerHealthReport": { # WorkerHealthReport contains information about the health of a worker. The VM should be identified by the labels attached to the WorkerMessage that this health ping belongs to. # The health of a worker.
          "pods": [ # The pods running on the worker. See: http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/api-reference/v1/definitions.html#_v1_pod This field is used by the worker to send the status of the indvidual containers running on each worker.
            {
              "a_key": "", # Properties of the object.
            },
          ],
          "reportInterval": "A String", # The interval at which the worker is sending health reports. The default value of 0 should be interpreted as the field is not being explicitly set by the worker.
          "vmStartupTime": "A String", # The time the VM was booted.
          "vmIsHealthy": True or False, # Whether the VM is healthy.
        },
        "labels": { # Labels are used to group WorkerMessages. For example, a worker_message about a particular container might have the labels: { "JOB_ID": "2015-04-22", "WORKER_ID": "wordcount-vm-2015â€¦" "CONTAINER_TYPE": "worker", "CONTAINER_ID": "ac1234def"} Label tags typically correspond to Label enum values. However, for ease of development other strings can be used as tags. LABEL_UNSPECIFIED should not be used here.
          "a_key": "A String",
        },
        "workerMessageCode": { # A message code is used to report status and error messages to the service. The message codes are intended to be machine readable. The service will take care of translating these into user understandable messages if necessary. Example use cases: 1. Worker processes reporting successful startup. 2. Worker processes reporting specific errors (e.g. package staging failure). # A worker message code.
          "code": "A String", # The code is a string intended for consumption by a machine that identifies the type of message being sent. Examples: 1. "HARNESS_STARTED" might be used to indicate the worker harness has started. 2. "GCS_DOWNLOAD_ERROR" might be used to indicate an error downloading a GCS file as part of the boot process of one of the worker containers. This is a string and not an enum to make it easy to add new codes without waiting for an API change.
          "parameters": { # Parameters contains specific information about the code. This is a struct to allow parameters of different types. Examples: 1. For a "HARNESS_STARTED" message parameters might provide the name of the worker and additional data like timing information. 2. For a "GCS_DOWNLOAD_ERROR" parameters might contain fields listing the GCS objects being downloaded and fields containing errors. In general complex data structures should be avoided. If a worker needs to send a specific and complicated data structure then please consider defining a new proto and adding it to the data oneof in WorkerMessageResponse. Conventions: Parameters should only be used for information that isn't typically passed as a label. hostname and other worker identifiers should almost always be passed as labels since they will be included on most messages.
            "a_key": "", # Properties of the object.
          },
        },
        "time": "A String", # The timestamp of the worker_message.
      },
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response to the worker messages.
    "workerMessageResponses": [ # The servers response to the worker messages.
      { # A worker_message response allows the server to pass information to the sender.
        "workerHealthReportResponse": { # WorkerHealthReportResponse contains information returned to the worker in response to a health ping. # The service's response to a worker's health report.
          "reportInterval": "A String", # A positive value indicates the worker should change its reporting interval to the specified value. The default value of zero means no change in report rate is requested by the server.
        },
      },
    ],
  }</pre>
