   at the top-level topic /devices/{device-id}/commands as well as commands
   for subfolders, like /devices/{device-id}/commands/subfolder.

If the command could not be delivered to the device, this method will
return an error; in particular, if the device is not subscribed, this

return OK. If the subscription is QoS 1, at least once delivery will be
guaranteed; for QoS 0, no acknowledgment will be expected from the device.
