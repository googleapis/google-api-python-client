  <pre>Sends a command to the specified device. In order for a device to be able
to receive commands, it must:
1) be connected to Cloud IoT Core using the MQTT protocol, and
2) be subscribed to the group of MQTT topics specified by
   /devices/{device-id}/commands/#. This subscription will receive commands
   at the top-level topic /devices/{device-id}/commands as well as commands
   for subfolders, like /devices/{device-id}/commands/subfolder.
   Note that subscribing to specific subfolders is not supported.
If the command could not be delivered to the device, this method will
return an error; in particular, if the device is not subscribed, this
method will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. Otherwise, this method will
return OK. If the subscription is QoS 1, at least once delivery will be
guaranteed; for QoS 0, no acknowledgment will be expected from the device.
