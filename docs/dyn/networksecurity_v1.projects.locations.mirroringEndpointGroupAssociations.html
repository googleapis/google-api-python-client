  <pre>Creates an association in a given project and location. See https://google.aip.dev/133.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Container (project and location) where the association will be created, e.g. `projects/123456789/locations/global`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An endpoint group association represents a link between a network and an endpoint group in the organization. Creating an association creates the networking infrastructure linking the network to the endpoint group, but does not enable mirroring by itself. To enable mirroring, the user must also create a network firewall policy containing mirroring rules and associate it with the network.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created. See https://google.aip.dev/148#timestamps.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels are key/value pairs that help to organize and filter resources.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;locationsDetails&quot;: [ # Output only. The list of locations where the association is present. This information is retrieved from the linked endpoint group, and not configured as part of the association itself.
    { # Contains details about the state of an association in a specific cloud location.
      &quot;location&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The cloud location, e.g. &quot;us-central1-a&quot; or &quot;asia-south1&quot;.
      &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the association in this location.
    },
  ],
  &quot;mirroringEndpointGroup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The endpoint group that this association is connected to, for example: `projects/123456789/locations/global/mirroringEndpointGroups/my-eg`. See https://google.aip.dev/124.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Identifier. The resource name of this endpoint group association, for example: `projects/123456789/locations/global/mirroringEndpointGroupAssociations/my-eg-association`. See https://google.aip.dev/122 for more details.
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The VPC network that is associated. for example: `projects/123456789/global/networks/my-network`. See https://google.aip.dev/124.
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. The current state of the resource does not match the user&#x27;s intended state, and the system is working to reconcile them. This part of the normal operation (e.g. adding a new location to the target deployment group). See https://google.aip.dev/128.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Current state of the endpoint group association.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the resource was most recently updated. See https://google.aip.dev/148#timestamps.
}

  mirroringEndpointGroupAssociationId: string, Optional. ID for the new association. If not provided, the server will generate a unique ID. The ID must be a valid RFC 1035 resource name. The ID must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`. The first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for the last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit. The last character must be a
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
