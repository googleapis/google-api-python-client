  &quot;access&quot;: [ # [Optional] An array of objects that define dataset access for one or more entities. You can set this property when inserting or updating a dataset in order to control who is allowed to access the data. If unspecified at dataset creation time, BigQuery adds default dataset access for the following entities: access.specialGroup: projectReaders; access.role: READER; access.specialGroup: projectWriters; access.role: WRITER; access.specialGroup: projectOwners; access.role: OWNER; access.userByEmail: [dataset creator email]; access.role: OWNER;

The storage in a partition will have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value. Setting this property overrides the use of defaultTableExpirationMs for partitioned tables: only one of defaultTableExpirationMs and defaultPartitionExpirationMs will be used for any new partitioned table. If you provide an explicit timePartitioning.expirationMs when creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.
  &quot;defaultTableExpirationMs&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. The minimum value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour).

When the expirationTime for a given table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically. If a table&#x27;s expirationTime is modified or removed before the table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default expiration time indicated by this property.

The storage in a partition will have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value. Setting this property overrides the use of defaultTableExpirationMs for partitioned tables: only one of defaultTableExpirationMs and defaultPartitionExpirationMs will be used for any new partitioned table.

When the expirationTime for a given table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically. If a table&#x27;s expirationTime is modified or removed before the table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default expiration time indicated by this property.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(projectId, datasetId, body=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates information in an existing dataset. The update method replaces the entire dataset resource, whereas the patch method only replaces fields that are provided in the submitted dataset resource.

Args:
  projectId: string, Project ID of the dataset being updated (required)
  datasetId: string, Dataset ID of the dataset being updated (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;access&quot;: [ # [Optional] An array of objects that define dataset access for one or more entities. You can set this property when inserting or updating a dataset in order to control who is allowed to access the data. If unspecified at dataset creation time, BigQuery adds default dataset access for the following entities: access.specialGroup: projectReaders; access.role: READER; access.specialGroup: projectWriters; access.role: WRITER; access.specialGroup: projectOwners; access.role: OWNER; access.userByEmail: [dataset creator email]; access.role: OWNER;

The following legacy mappings will be applied: OWNER  roles/bigquery.dataOwner WRITER  roles/bigquery.dataEditor READER  roles/bigquery.dataViewer This field will accept any of the above formats, but will return only the legacy format. For example, if you set this field to &quot;roles/bigquery.dataOwner&quot;, it will be returned back as &quot;OWNER&quot;.
      &quot;routine&quot;: { # [Pick one] A routine from a different dataset to grant access to. Queries executed against that routine will have read access to views/tables/routines in this dataset. Only UDF is supported for now. The role field is not required when this field is set. If that routine is updated by any user, access to the routine needs to be granted again via an update operation.
        &quot;datasetId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Required] The ID of the dataset containing this routine.
        &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Required] The ID of the project containing this routine.
        &quot;routineId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Required] The ID of the routine. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 256 characters.

Possible values include: projectOwners: Owners of the enclosing project. projectReaders: Readers of the enclosing project. projectWriters: Writers of the enclosing project. allAuthenticatedUsers: All authenticated BigQuery users. Maps to similarly-named IAM members.
      &quot;userByEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Pick one] An email address of a user to grant access to. For example: fred@example.com. Maps to IAM policy member &quot;user:EMAIL&quot; or &quot;serviceAccount:EMAIL&quot;.

  &quot;defaultPartitionExpirationMs&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The default partition expiration for all partitioned tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in the dataset will have an expirationMs property in the timePartitioning settings set to this value, and changing the value will only affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value. Setting this property overrides the use of defaultTableExpirationMs for partitioned tables: only one of defaultTableExpirationMs and defaultPartitionExpirationMs will be used for any new partitioned table. If you provide an explicit timePartitioning.expirationMs when creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.
  &quot;defaultTableExpirationMs&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. The minimum value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour). Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset will have an expirationTime property set to the creation time plus the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically. If a table&#x27;s expirationTime is modified or removed before the table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default expiration time indicated by this property.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] A user-friendly description of the dataset.

  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output-only] The fully-qualified unique name of the dataset in the format projectId:datasetId. The dataset name without the project name is given in the datasetId field. When creating a new dataset, leave this field blank, and instead specify the datasetId field.
  &quot;isCaseInsensitive&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if table names are case insensitive in the dataset.
