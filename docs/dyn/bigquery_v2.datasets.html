<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(projectId, datasetId, body)</code>
  <pre>Updates information in an existing dataset. The update method replaces the entire dataset resource, whereas the patch method only replaces fields that are provided in the submitted dataset resource.

Args:
  projectId: string, Project ID of the dataset being updated (required)
  datasetId: string, Dataset ID of the dataset being updated (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
