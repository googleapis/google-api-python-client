The {service} in the name is the listing service of the offer. It could be either the product service that the offer is referencing, or a generic private offer parent service. We recommend that you don&#x27;t build your integration to rely on the meaning of this {service} part. * If the entitlement is in ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVATION_REQUESTED state, this field will be populated with the upcoming offer. * If the entitlement is in ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE, ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION, ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE, or ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE_APPROVAL state, this field will be populated with the current offer. * If the entitlement is in ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED state, then this field will be populated with the latest offer the order was associated with.

Otherwise, this field will be empty.
  &quot;offerEndTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. End time for the Offer associated with this entitlement. Note that this field value can change over time. This occurs naturally even if the offer is not changed, due to auto renewal. * If the entitlement is in ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVATION_REQUESTED state, then: * If the entitlement is not yet approved, then this field will be populated with the expected end time of the upcoming offer (in the future) if the upcoming offer has a specified end date. Otherwise this field will be empty. * If the entitlement is approved, then this field will always be populated with the expected end time of the upcoming offer (in the future). This means both this field, and the offer_duration field, can co-exist. * If the entitlement is in ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE or ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION state, then this field will be populated with the actual expected end time of the current offer (in the futre). Meaning, this field will be set, regardless of whether the offer has a specific end date or a duration. This means both this field, and the offer_duration field, can co-exist. * If the entitlement is in ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE_APPROVAL or ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE state: * If the current offer has already ended and became pure PAYG, then this field reflects the ACTUAL end time of the current offer (in the past). * Otherwise, then this is the EXPECTED end date of the current offer (in the future). * If the entitlement is in ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED state, then this field will be populated with the ACTUAL end time of the latest offer the order was associated with (in the past). If the entitlement was cancelled before any offer started, then this field will be empty.

  &quot;product&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The identifier of the entity that was purchased. This may actually represent a product, quote, or offer. We strongly recommend that you use the following more explicit fields: productExternalName, quoteExternalName, or offer.
  &quot;productExternalName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The identifier of the product that was procured.
  &quot;provider&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The identifier of the service provider that this entitlement was created against. Each service provider is assigned a unique provider value when they onboard with Cloud Commerce platform.

  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the entitlement.

  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last update timestamp.
  &quot;usageReportingId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The consumerId to use when reporting usage through the Service Control API.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Entitlements for which the provider has read access.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource name. (required)
  filter: string, The filter that can be used to limit the list request. The filter is a query string that can match a selected set of attributes with string values. For example `account=E-1234-5678-ABCD-EFGH`, `state=pending_cancellation`, and `plan!=foo-plan`. Supported query attributes are * `account` * `customer_billing_account` with value in the format of: `billingAccounts/{id}` * `product_external_name` * `quote_external_name` * `offer` * `new_pending_offer` * `plan` * `newPendingPlan` or `new_pending_plan` * `state` * `services` * `consumers.project` * `change_history.new_offer` Note that the consumers and change_history.new_offer match works on repeated structures, so equality (`consumers.project=projects/123456789`) is not supported. Set membership can be expressed with the `:` operator. For example, `consumers.project:projects/123456789` finds entitlements with at least one consumer with project field equal to `projects/123456789`. `change_history.new_offer` retrieves all entitlements that were once associated or are currently active with the offer. Also note that the state name match is case-insensitive and query can omit the prefix &quot;ENTITLEMENT_&quot;. For example, `state=active` is equivalent to `state=ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE`. If the query contains some special characters other than letters, underscore, or digits, the phrase must be quoted with double quotes. For example, `product=&quot;providerId:productId&quot;`, where the product name needs to be quoted because it contains special character colon. Queries can be combined with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to form more complex queries. They can also be grouped to force a desired evaluation order. For example, `state=active AND (account=E-1234 OR account=5678) AND NOT (product=foo-product)`. Connective `AND` can be omitted between two predicates. For example `account=E-1234 state=active` is equivalent to `account=E-1234 AND state=active`.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of entries that are requested. The default page size is 200.
  pageToken: string, The token for fetching the next page.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
