  <pre>CreateSecurityAction creates a SecurityAction.

    The object takes the form of:

Across conditions elements are ANDed. For example if a SecurityAction has the following: api_keys: [&quot;key1&quot;, &quot;key2&quot;] and developers: [&quot;dev1&quot;, &quot;dev2&quot;] then this is interpreted as: enforce the action if the incoming request has ((api_key = &quot;key1&quot; OR api_key=&quot;key&quot;) AND (developer=&quot;dev1&quot; OR developer=&quot;dev2&quot;)) # Required.
