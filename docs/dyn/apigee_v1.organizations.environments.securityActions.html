  <pre>CreateSecurityAction creates a SecurityAction.

Args:

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  },
  &quot;conditionConfig&quot;: { # The following are a list of conditions. A valid SecurityAction must contain at least one condition. Within a condition, each element is ORed. Across conditions elements are ANDed. For example if a SecurityAction has the following: ip_address_ranges: [&quot;ip1&quot;, &quot;ip2&quot;] and bot_reasons: [&quot;Flooder&quot;, &quot;Robot Abuser&quot;] then this is interpreted as: enforce the action if the incoming request has ((ip_address_ranges = &quot;ip1&quot; OR ip_address_ranges = &quot;ip2&quot;) AND (bot_reasons=&quot;Flooder&quot; OR bot_reasons=&quot;Robot Abuser&quot;)).
