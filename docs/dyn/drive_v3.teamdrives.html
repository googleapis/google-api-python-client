  <pre>Deprecated use drives.create instead.

Args:
  requestId: string, An ID, such as a random UUID, which uniquely identifies this user's request for idempotent creation of a Team Drive. A repeated request by the same user and with the same request ID will avoid creating duplicates by attempting to create the same Team Drive. If the Team Drive already exists a 409 error will be returned. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:
