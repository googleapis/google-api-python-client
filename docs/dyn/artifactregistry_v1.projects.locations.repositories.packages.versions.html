  <pre>Deletes multiple versions across a repository. The returned operation will complete once the versions have been deleted.

Args:
  parent: string, The name of the repository holding all requested versions. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request to delete multiple versions across a repository.
  &quot;names&quot;: [ # Required. The names of the versions to delete. A maximum of 10000 versions can be deleted in a batch.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],

}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

For example, to filter the results of your request to versions with the annotation key-value pair [`external.link`:`https://example.com/my-version`], append the following filter expression to your request: * `` &quot;annotations.`external.link`:`https://example.com/my-version`&quot; `` You can also filter with annotations with a wildcard to match any number of characters before or after the value: * `` &quot;annotations.*_link:`*example.com*`&quot; ``
