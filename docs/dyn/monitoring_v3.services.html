<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>List Services for this Metrics Scope.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Resource name of the parent containing the listed services, either a project (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3#project_name) or a Monitoring Metrics Scope. The formats are: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER] workspaces/[HOST_PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]  (required)
  filter: string, A filter specifying what Services to return. The filter supports filtering on a particular service-identifier type or one of its attributes.To filter on a particular service-identifier type, the identifier_case refers to which option in the identifier field is populated. For example, the filter identifier_case = &quot;CUSTOM&quot; would match all services with a value for the custom field. Valid options include &quot;CUSTOM&quot;, &quot;APP_ENGINE&quot;, &quot;MESH_ISTIO&quot;, and the other options listed at https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services#ServiceTo filter on an attribute of a service-identifier type, apply the filter name by using the snake case of the service-identifier type and the attribute of that service-identifier type, and join the two with a period. For example, to filter by the meshUid field of the MeshIstio service-identifier type, you must filter on mesh_istio.mesh_uid = &quot;123&quot; to match all services with mesh UID &quot;123&quot;. Service-identifier types and their attributes are described at https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services#Service
  pageSize: integer, A non-negative number that is the maximum number of results to return. When 0, use default page size.
  pageToken: string, If this field is not empty then it must contain the nextPageToken value returned by a previous call to this method. Using this field causes the method to return additional results from the previous method call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
