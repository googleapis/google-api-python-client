<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">

  <pre>Creates a task and adds it to a queue.

Tasks cannot be updated after creation; there is no UpdateTask command.

* The maximum task size is 100KB.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The queue name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID`

The queue must already exist. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CreateTask.
    &quot;responseView&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
        # returned.
        # 
        # By default response_view is BASIC; not all
        # information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
        # payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
        # of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
        # contains.
        # 
        # Authorization for FULL requires
        # `cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)
        # permission on the Task resource.
    &quot;task&quot;: { # A unit of scheduled work. # Required. The task to add.
        # 
        # Task names have the following format:
        # `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID`.
        # The user can optionally specify a task name. If a
        # name is not specified then the system will generate a random
        # unique task id, which will be set in the task returned in the
        # response.
        # 
        # If schedule_time is not set or is in the
        # past then Cloud Tasks will set it to the current time.
        # 
        # Task De-duplication:
        # 
        # Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication.  If
        # a task&#x27;s ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task
        # that was deleted or executed recently then the call will fail
        # with ALREADY_EXISTS.
        # If the task&#x27;s queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with
        # the same name can&#x27;t be created for ~1hour after the original task was
        # deleted or executed. If the task&#x27;s queue was created using queue.yaml or
        # queue.xml, then another task with the same name can&#x27;t be created
        # for ~9days after the original task was deleted or executed.
        # 
        # Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task
        # names, these CreateTask calls have significantly
        # increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for
        # the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that
        # are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a
        # timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all
        # task commands. The infrastructure relies on an approximately
        # uniform distribution of task ids to store and serve tasks
        # efficiently.
      &quot;responseCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. The number of attempts which have received a response.
      &quot;appEngineHttpRequest&quot;: { # App Engine HTTP request. # HTTP request that is sent to the App Engine app handler.
          #
          # An App Engine task is a task that has AppEngineHttpRequest set.
          #
          # The message defines the HTTP request that is sent to an App Engine app when
          # the task is dispatched.
          #
          # Using AppEngineHttpRequest requires
          # [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control)
          # Google IAM permission for the project
          # and the following scope:
          #
          # `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`
          #
          # The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same
          # project as the queue. For more information, see
          # [How Requests are
          # Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed)
          # and how routing is affected by

          # files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
          # Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
          # Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
          # Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
          # The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP
          # protocol.
          #
          # The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is
          # delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level:
          #
          # * If set,
          #   app_engine_routing_override
          #   is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting
          #   is for the
          #   task-level app_engine_routing.
          #
          #
          # The `url` that the task will be sent to is:
          #
          # * `url =` host `+`
          #   relative_uri
          #
          # Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and
          # URIs restricted with
          # [`login:
          # admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref).
          # Because tasks are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs
          # restricted with
          # [`login:
          # required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref)
          # Task dispatches also do not follow redirects.
          #
          # The task attempt has succeeded if the app&#x27;s request handler returns an HTTP
          # response code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if
          # the app&#x27;s handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does
          # not receive response before the deadline. Failed
          # tasks will be retried according to the
          # retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is

          # will cause Cloud Tasks&#x27; traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle
          # the queue&#x27;s dispatches. Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many
          # Requests) response from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion
          # control to throttle the queue.
        &quot;httpMethod&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP method to use for the request. The default is POST.
            #
            # The app&#x27;s request handler for the task&#x27;s target URL must be able to handle
            # HTTP requests with this http_method, otherwise the task attempt fails with

            # A request body is allowed only if the HTTP method is POST or PUT. It is
            # an error to set a body on a task with an incompatible HttpMethod.
        &quot;relativeUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The relative URI.

            # The relative URI must begin with &quot;/&quot; and must be a valid HTTP relative URI.
            # It can contain a path and query string arguments.
            # If the relative URI is empty, then the root path &quot;/&quot; will be used.

            #   `&quot;AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)&quot;`.
            #   This header can be modified, but Cloud Tasks will append
            #   `&quot;AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)&quot;` to the
            #   modified `User-Agent`.
            #
            # If the task has a body, Cloud
            # Tasks sets the following headers:
            #
            # * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
            #   `&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;`. The default can be overridden by explicitly
            #   setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
            #   task is created.
            #   For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `&quot;application/json&quot;`.
            # * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is
            #   output only.   It cannot be changed.
            #
            # The headers below cannot be set or overridden:

        #
        # An HTTP task is a task that has HttpRequest set.
        #
        # The task will be pushed to the worker as an HTTP request. If the worker
        # or the redirected worker acknowledges the task by returning a successful HTTP
        # response code ([`200` - `299`]), the task will be removed from the queue. If
        # any other HTTP response code is returned or no response is received, the
        # task will be retried according to the following:
        #
        # * User-specified throttling: retry configuration,
        #   rate limits, and the queue&#x27;s state.
        #
        # * System throttling: To prevent the worker from overloading, Cloud Tasks may
        #   temporarily reduce the queue&#x27;s effective rate. User-specified settings
        #   will not be changed.
        #
        #  System throttling happens because:
        #
        #   * Cloud Tasks backs off on all errors. Normally the backoff specified in
        #     rate limits will be used. But if the worker returns
        #     `429` (Too Many Requests), `503` (Service Unavailable), or the rate of
        #     errors is high, Cloud Tasks will use a higher backoff rate. The retry
        #     specified in the `Retry-After` HTTP response header is considered.
        #
        #   * To prevent traffic spikes and to smooth sudden increases in traffic,
        #     dispatches ramp up slowly when the queue is newly created or idle and
        #     if large numbers of tasks suddenly become available to dispatch (due to
        #     spikes in create task rates, the queue being unpaused, or many tasks
        #     that are scheduled at the same time).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a task.

A task can be deleted if it is scheduled or dispatched. A task
cannot be deleted if it has executed successfully or permanently
failed.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The task name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID` (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, responseView=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a task.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The task name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID` (required)
  responseView: string, The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
returned.

By default response_view is BASIC; not all
information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
contains.

Authorization for FULL requires
`cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)
permission on the Task resource.

        # An App Engine task is a task that has AppEngineHttpRequest set.
        #
        # The message defines the HTTP request that is sent to an App Engine app when
        # the task is dispatched.
        #
        # Using AppEngineHttpRequest requires
        # [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control)
        # Google IAM permission for the project
        # and the following scope:
        #
        # `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`
        #
        # The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to the same
        # project as the queue. For more information, see
        # [How Requests are
        # Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-requests-are-routed)
        # and how routing is affected by
        # [dispatch
        # files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
        # Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
        # Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
        # Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
        # The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP
        # protocol.
        #
        # The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is
        # delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level:
        #
        # * If set,
        #   app_engine_routing_override
        #   is used for all tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting
        #   is for the
        #   task-level app_engine_routing.
        #
        #
        # The `url` that the task will be sent to is:
        #
        # * `url =` host `+`
        #   relative_uri
        #
        # Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers, unsecure app handlers, and
        # URIs restricted with
        # [`login:
        # admin`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref).

          #   modified `User-Agent`.
          #
          # If the task has a body, Cloud
          # Tasks sets the following headers:
          #
          # * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
          #   `&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;`. The default can be overridden by explicitly
          #   setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
          #   task is created.
          #   For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `&quot;application/json&quot;`.

          #   output only.   It cannot be changed.
          #
          # The headers below cannot be set or overridden:

        #
        #  System throttling happens because:
        #
        #   * Cloud Tasks backs off on all errors. Normally the backoff specified in

        #     specified in the `Retry-After` HTTP response header is considered.
        #

        #     dispatches ramp up slowly when the queue is newly created or idle and
        #     if large numbers of tasks suddenly become available to dispatch (due to

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, responseView=None, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the tasks in a queue.

By default, only the BASIC view is retrieved
due to performance considerations;
response_view controls the
subset of information which is returned.

The tasks may be returned in any order. The ordering may change at any
time.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The queue name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` (required)
  responseView: string, The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
returned.

By default response_view is BASIC; not all
information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
contains.

Authorization for FULL requires
`cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)
permission on the Task resource.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying the page of results to return.

To request the first page results, page_token must be empty. To
request the next page of results, page_token must be the value of
next_page_token returned
from the previous call to ListTasks
method.

The page token is valid for only 2 hours.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum page size.

Fewer tasks than requested might be returned, even if more tasks exist; use
next_page_token in the response to
determine if more tasks exist.

The maximum page size is 1000. If unspecified, the page size will be the
maximum.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for listing tasks using ListTasks.
    &quot;tasks&quot;: [ # The list of tasks.

            # An HTTP task is a task that has HttpRequest set.
            #
            # The task will be pushed to the worker as an HTTP request. If the worker
            # or the redirected worker acknowledges the task by returning a successful HTTP
            # response code ([`200` - `299`]), the task will be removed from the queue. If
            # any other HTTP response code is returned or no response is received, the
            # task will be retried according to the following:
            #
            # * User-specified throttling: retry configuration,
            #   rate limits, and the queue&#x27;s state.
            #
            # * System throttling: To prevent the worker from overloading, Cloud Tasks may
            #   temporarily reduce the queue&#x27;s effective rate. User-specified settings
            #   will not be changed.
            #
            #  System throttling happens because:
            #
            #   * Cloud Tasks backs off on all errors. Normally the backoff specified in
            #     rate limits will be used. But if the worker returns
            #     `429` (Too Many Requests), `503` (Service Unavailable), or the rate of
            #     errors is high, Cloud Tasks will use a higher backoff rate. The retry
            #     specified in the `Retry-After` HTTP response header is considered.
            #
            #   * To prevent traffic spikes and to smooth sudden increases in traffic,
            #     dispatches ramp up slowly when the queue is newly created or idle and
            #     if large numbers of tasks suddenly become available to dispatch (due to
            #     spikes in create task rates, the queue being unpaused, or many tasks
            #     that are scheduled at the same time).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="run">run(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Forces a task to run now.

When this method is called, Cloud Tasks will dispatch the task, even if
the task is already running, the queue has reached its RateLimits or
is PAUSED.

This command is meant to be used for manual debugging. For
example, RunTask can be used to retry a failed
task after a fix has been made or to manually force a task to be
dispatched now.

The dispatched task is returned. That is, the task that is returned
contains the status after the task is dispatched but
before the task is received by its target.

If Cloud Tasks receives a successful response from the task&#x27;s
target, then the task will be deleted; otherwise the task&#x27;s
schedule_time will be reset to the time that
RunTask was called plus the retry delay specified
in the queue&#x27;s RetryConfig.

RunTask returns
NOT_FOUND when it is called on a
task that has already succeeded or permanently failed.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The task name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for forcing a task to run now using
      # RunTask.
    &quot;responseView&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
        # returned.
        # 
        # By default response_view is BASIC; not all
        # information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
        # payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
        # of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
        # contains.
        # 
        # Authorization for FULL requires
        # `cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)

  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
