<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="approve">approve(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Approve an account service proposal.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the account service to approve. Format: `accounts/{account}/services/{service}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to approve an account service.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The `AccountService` message represents a specific service that a provider account offers to a Merchant Center account. `AccountService` defines the permissions and capabilities granted to the provider, allowing for operations such as product management or campaign management. The lifecycle of an `AccountService` involves a proposal phase, where one party suggests the service, and an approval phase, where the other party accepts or rejects it. This handshake mechanism ensures mutual consent before any access is granted. This mechanism safeguards both parties by ensuring that access rights are granted appropriately and that both the business and provider are aware of the services enabled. In scenarios where a user is an admin of both accounts, the approval can happen automatically. The mutability of a service is also managed through `AccountService`. Some services might be immutable, for example, if they were established through other systems or APIs, and you cannot alter them through this API.
  &quot;accountAggregation&quot;: { # `AccountAggregation` payload. # Service type for account aggregation. This enables the provider, which is an advanced account, to manage multiple sub-accounts (client accounts). Through this service, the advanced account provider can perform administrative and operational tasks across all linked sub-accounts. This is useful for agencies, aggregators, or large retailers that need centralized control over many Merchant Center accounts.
  },
  &quot;accountManagement&quot;: { # `AccountManagement` payload. # Service type for account management. Enables the provider to perform administrative actions on the business&#x27;s account, such as configuring account settings, managing users, or updating business information.

  &quot;campaignsManagement&quot;: { # `CampaignManagement` payload. # Service type for managing advertising campaigns. Grants the provider access to create and manage the business&#x27;s ad campaigns, including setting up campaigns, adjusting bids, and optimizing performance.
  },
  &quot;externalAccountId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. An optional, immutable identifier that Google uses to refer to this account when communicating with the provider. This should be the unique account ID within the provider&#x27;s system (for example, your shop ID in Shopify). If you have multiple accounts with the same provider - for instance, different accounts for various regions â€” the `external_account_id` differentiates between them, ensuring accurate linking and integration between Google and the provider.

    &quot;approvalState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The approval state of this handshake.
  },
  &quot;localListingManagement&quot;: { # `LocalListingManagement` payload. # Service type for local listings management. The business group associated with the external account id will be used to provide local inventory to this Merchant Center account.
