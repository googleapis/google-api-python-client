Args:
  parent: string, This field contains the project Id for example: &quot;projects/{project_id}&quot; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # `Occurrence` includes information about analysis occurrences for an image.
  &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an Attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the AttestationAuthority to which this Attestation is attached is primarily useful for look-up (how to find this Attestation if you already know the Authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (which authority was this attestation intended to sign for). # Describes an attestation of an artifact.
    &quot;pgpSignedAttestation&quot;: { # An attestation wrapper with a PGP-compatible signature. This message only supports `ATTACHED` signatures, where the payload that is signed is included alongside the signature itself in the same file.
      &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Type (for example schema) of the attestation payload that was signed. The verifier must ensure that the provided type is one that the verifier supports, and that the attestation payload is a valid instantiation of that type (for example by validating a JSON schema).
      &quot;pgpKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The cryptographic fingerprint of the key used to generate the signature, as output by, e.g. `gpg --list-keys`. This should be the version 4, full 160-bit fingerprint, expressed as a 40 character hexadecimal string. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-12.2 for details. Implementations may choose to acknowledge &quot;LONG&quot;, &quot;SHORT&quot;, or other abbreviated key IDs, but only the full fingerprint is guaranteed to work. In gpg, the full fingerprint can be retrieved from the `fpr` field returned when calling --list-keys with --with-colons. For example: ``` gpg --with-colons --with-fingerprint --force-v4-certs \ --list-keys attester@example.com tru::1:1513631572:0:3:1:5 pub:...... fpr:::::::::24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB: ``` Above, the fingerprint is `24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB`.
      &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The raw content of the signature, as output by GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) or equivalent. Since this message only supports attached signatures, the payload that was signed must be attached. While the signature format supported is dependent on the verification implementation, currently only ASCII-armored (`--armor` to gpg), non-clearsigned (`--sign` rather than `--clearsign` to gpg) are supported. Concretely, `gpg --sign --armor --output=signature.gpg payload.json` will create the signature content expected in this field in `signature.gpg` for the `payload.json` attestation payload.

  name: string, The name of the occurrence of the form &quot;projects/{project_id}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}&quot; (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # `Occurrence` includes information about analysis occurrences for an image.
  &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an Attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the AttestationAuthority to which this Attestation is attached is primarily useful for look-up (how to find this Attestation if you already know the Authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (which authority was this attestation intended to sign for). # Describes an attestation of an artifact.
    &quot;pgpSignedAttestation&quot;: { # An attestation wrapper with a PGP-compatible signature. This message only supports `ATTACHED` signatures, where the payload that is signed is included alongside the signature itself in the same file.
      &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Type (for example schema) of the attestation payload that was signed. The verifier must ensure that the provided type is one that the verifier supports, and that the attestation payload is a valid instantiation of that type (for example by validating a JSON schema).
      &quot;pgpKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The cryptographic fingerprint of the key used to generate the signature, as output by, e.g. `gpg --list-keys`. This should be the version 4, full 160-bit fingerprint, expressed as a 40 character hexadecimal string. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-12.2 for details. Implementations may choose to acknowledge &quot;LONG&quot;, &quot;SHORT&quot;, or other abbreviated key IDs, but only the full fingerprint is guaranteed to work. In gpg, the full fingerprint can be retrieved from the `fpr` field returned when calling --list-keys with --with-colons. For example: ``` gpg --with-colons --with-fingerprint --force-v4-certs \ --list-keys attester@example.com tru::1:1513631572:0:3:1:5 pub:...... fpr:::::::::24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB: ``` Above, the fingerprint is `24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB`.
      &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The raw content of the signature, as output by GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) or equivalent. Since this message only supports attached signatures, the payload that was signed must be attached. While the signature format supported is dependent on the verification implementation, currently only ASCII-armored (`--armor` to gpg), non-clearsigned (`--sign` rather than `--clearsign` to gpg) are supported. Concretely, `gpg --sign --armor --output=signature.gpg payload.json` will create the signature content expected in this field in `signature.gpg` for the `payload.json` attestation payload.

    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a note or an `Occurrence` resource. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a note or occurrence, respectively. Attempting to call this method on a resource without the required permission will result in a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error. Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}` for occurrences and projects/{PROJECT_ID}/notes/{NOTE_ID} for notes

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

Concretely, `gpg --sign --armor --output=signature.gpg payload.json` will create the signature content expected in this field in `signature.gpg` for the `payload.json` attestation payload.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates an existing occurrence.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the occurrence. Should be of the form &quot;projects/{project_id}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # `Occurrence` includes information about analysis occurrences for an image.
  &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an Attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the AttestationAuthority to which this Attestation is attached is primarily useful for look-up (how to find this Attestation if you already know the Authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (which authority was this attestation intended to sign for). # Describes an attestation of an artifact.
    &quot;pgpSignedAttestation&quot;: { # An attestation wrapper with a PGP-compatible signature. This message only supports `ATTACHED` signatures, where the payload that is signed is included alongside the signature itself in the same file.
      &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Type (for example schema) of the attestation payload that was signed. The verifier must ensure that the provided type is one that the verifier supports, and that the attestation payload is a valid instantiation of that type (for example by validating a JSON schema).
      &quot;pgpKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The cryptographic fingerprint of the key used to generate the signature, as output by, e.g. `gpg --list-keys`. This should be the version 4, full 160-bit fingerprint, expressed as a 40 character hexadecimal string. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-12.2 for details. Implementations may choose to acknowledge &quot;LONG&quot;, &quot;SHORT&quot;, or other abbreviated key IDs, but only the full fingerprint is guaranteed to work. In gpg, the full fingerprint can be retrieved from the `fpr` field returned when calling --list-keys with --with-colons. For example: ``` gpg --with-colons --with-fingerprint --force-v4-certs \ --list-keys attester@example.com tru::1:1513631572:0:3:1:5 pub:...... fpr:::::::::24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB: ``` Above, the fingerprint is `24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB`.
      &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The raw content of the signature, as output by GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) or equivalent. Since this message only supports attached signatures, the payload that was signed must be attached. While the signature format supported is dependent on the verification implementation, currently only ASCII-armored (`--armor` to gpg), non-clearsigned (`--sign` rather than `--clearsign` to gpg) are supported. Concretely, `gpg --sign --armor --output=signature.gpg payload.json` will create the signature content expected in this field in `signature.gpg` for the `payload.json` attestation payload.

    { # `Occurrence` includes information about analysis occurrences for an image.
  &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an Attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the AttestationAuthority to which this Attestation is attached is primarily useful for look-up (how to find this Attestation if you already know the Authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (which authority was this attestation intended to sign for). # Describes an attestation of an artifact.
    &quot;pgpSignedAttestation&quot;: { # An attestation wrapper with a PGP-compatible signature. This message only supports `ATTACHED` signatures, where the payload that is signed is included alongside the signature itself in the same file.
      &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Type (for example schema) of the attestation payload that was signed. The verifier must ensure that the provided type is one that the verifier supports, and that the attestation payload is a valid instantiation of that type (for example by validating a JSON schema).
      &quot;pgpKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The cryptographic fingerprint of the key used to generate the signature, as output by, e.g. `gpg --list-keys`. This should be the version 4, full 160-bit fingerprint, expressed as a 40 character hexadecimal string. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-12.2 for details. Implementations may choose to acknowledge &quot;LONG&quot;, &quot;SHORT&quot;, or other abbreviated key IDs, but only the full fingerprint is guaranteed to work. In gpg, the full fingerprint can be retrieved from the `fpr` field returned when calling --list-keys with --with-colons. For example: ``` gpg --with-colons --with-fingerprint --force-v4-certs \ --list-keys attester@example.com tru::1:1513631572:0:3:1:5 pub:...... fpr:::::::::24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB: ``` Above, the fingerprint is `24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB`.
      &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The raw content of the signature, as output by GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) or equivalent. Since this message only supports attached signatures, the payload that was signed must be attached. While the signature format supported is dependent on the verification implementation, currently only ASCII-armored (`--armor` to gpg), non-clearsigned (`--sign` rather than `--clearsign` to gpg) are supported. Concretely, `gpg --sign --armor --output=signature.gpg payload.json` will create the signature content expected in this field in `signature.gpg` for the `payload.json` attestation payload.

    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified `Note` or `Occurrence`. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a `Note` or an `Occurrence`, respectively. Attempting to call this method without these permissions will result in a ` `PERMISSION_DENIED` error. Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has `containeranalysis.notes.list` permission on a `Note` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.list` on an `Occurrence`, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{projectid}/occurrences/{occurrenceid}` for occurrences and projects/{projectid}/notes/{noteid} for notes

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the permissions that a caller has on the specified note or occurrence resource. Requires list permission on the project (for example, &quot;storage.objects.list&quot; on the containing bucket for testing permission of an object). Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID}` for `Occurrences` and `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/notes/{NOTE_ID}` for `Notes`

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
