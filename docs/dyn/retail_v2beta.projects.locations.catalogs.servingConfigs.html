<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="predict">predict(placement, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Makes a recommendation prediction.

Args:
  placement: string, Required. Full resource name of the format: `{placement=projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/*}` or `{placement=projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/placements/*}`. We recommend using the `servingConfigs` resource. `placements` is a legacy resource. The ID of the Recommendations AI serving config or placement. Before you can request predictions from your model, you must create at least one serving config or placement for it. For more information, see [Manage serving configs] (https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/manage-configs). The full list of available serving configs can be seen at https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/retail/catalogs/default_catalog/configs (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for Predict method.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Filter for restricting prediction results with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Accepts values for tags and the `filterOutOfStockItems` flag. * Tag expressions. Restricts predictions to products that match all of the specified tags. Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the expression is enclosed in parentheses, and must be separated from the tag values by a space. `-&quot;tagA&quot;` is also supported and is equivalent to `NOT &quot;tagA&quot;`. Tag values must be double quoted UTF-8 encoded strings with a size limit of 1,000 characters. Note: &quot;Recently viewed&quot; models don&#x27;t support tag filtering at the moment. * filterOutOfStockItems. Restricts predictions to products that do not have a stockState value of OUT_OF_STOCK. Examples: * tag=(&quot;Red&quot; OR &quot;Blue&quot;) tag=&quot;New-Arrival&quot; tag=(NOT &quot;promotional&quot;) * filterOutOfStockItems tag=(-&quot;promotional&quot;) * filterOutOfStockItems If your filter blocks all prediction results, the API will return *no* results. If instead you want empty result sets to return generic (unfiltered) popular products, set `strictFiltering` to False in `PredictRequest.params`. Note that the API will never return items with storageStatus of &quot;EXPIRED&quot; or &quot;DELETED&quot; regardless of filter choices. If `filterSyntaxV2` is set to true under the `params` field, then attribute-based expressions are expected instead of the above described tag-based syntax. Examples: * (colors: ANY(&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;)) AND NOT (categories: ANY(&quot;Phones&quot;)) * (availability: ANY(&quot;IN_STOCK&quot;)) AND (colors: ANY(&quot;Red&quot;) OR categories: ANY(&quot;Phones&quot;)) For more information, see [Filter recommendations](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/filter-recs).
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # The labels applied to a resource must meet the following requirements: * Each resource can have multiple labels, up to a maximum of 64. * Each label must be a key-value pair. * Keys have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 63 characters and cannot be empty. Values can be empty and have a maximum length of 63 characters. * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. * The key portion of a label must be unique. However, you can use the same key with multiple resources. * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character. See [Google Cloud Document](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels#requirements) for more details.

If set to true, the prediction &#x27;score&#x27; corresponding to each returned product will be set in the `results.metadata` field in the prediction response. The given &#x27;score&#x27; indicates the probability of a product being clicked/purchased given the user&#x27;s context and history. * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to false, the service will return generic (unfiltered) popular products instead of empty if your filter blocks all prediction results. * `priceRerankLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then it needs to be one of {&#x27;no-price-reranking&#x27;, &#x27;low-price-reranking&#x27;, &#x27;medium-price-reranking&#x27;, &#x27;high-price-reranking&#x27;}. This gives request-level control and adjusts prediction results based on product price. * `diversityLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then it needs to be one of {&#x27;no-diversity&#x27;, &#x27;low-diversity&#x27;, &#x27;medium-diversity&#x27;, &#x27;high-diversity&#x27;, &#x27;auto-diversity&#x27;}.

    <code class="details" id="search">search(placement, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Performs a search. This feature is only available for users who have Retail Search enabled. Enable Retail Search on Cloud Console before using this feature.

Args:
  placement: string, Required. The resource name of the Retail Search serving config, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/default_serving_config` or the name of the legacy placement resource, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/placements/default_search`. This field is used to identify the serving config name and the set of models that are used to make the search. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for SearchService.Search method.
  &quot;boostSpec&quot;: { # Boost specification to boost certain items. # Boost specification to boost certain products. For more information, see [Boost results](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/boosting).

However, it does not necessarily mean that the boosted item will be the top result at all times, nor that other items will be excluded. Results could still be shown even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your heavily favored but irrelevant items. Setting to -1.0 gives the item a big demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant might still be shown. The item will have an upstream battle to get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely. Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored.
        &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An expression which specifies a boost condition. The syntax and supported fields are the same as a filter expression. See SearchRequest.filter for detail syntax and limitations. Examples: * To boost products with product ID &quot;product_1&quot; or &quot;product_2&quot;, and color &quot;Red&quot; or &quot;Blue&quot;: * (id: ANY(&quot;product_1&quot;, &quot;product_2&quot;)) AND (colorFamilies: ANY(&quot;Red&quot;,&quot;Blue&quot;))
      },
    ],
    &quot;skipBoostSpecValidation&quot;: True or False, # Whether to skip boostspec validation. If this field is set to true, invalid BoostSpec.condition_boost_specs will be ignored and valid BoostSpec.condition_boost_specs will still be applied.
  },
  &quot;branch&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The branch resource name, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0`. Use &quot;default_branch&quot; as the branch ID or leave this field empty, to search products under the default branch.
  &quot;canonicalFilter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The default filter that is applied when a user performs a search without checking any filters on the search page. The filter applied to every search request when quality improvement such as query expansion is needed. In the case a query does not have a sufficient amount of results this filter will be used to determine whether or not to enable the query expansion flow. The original filter will still be used for the query expanded search. This field is strongly recommended to achieve high search quality.

  &quot;dynamicFacetSpec&quot;: { # The specifications of dynamically generated facets. # Deprecated. Refer to https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/configs#dynamic to enable dynamic facets.

If set to true, the position of this facet among all facets in the response is determined by Google Retail Search. It is ordered together with dynamic facets if dynamic facets is enabled. If set to false, the position of this facet in the response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before the facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets. For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it&#x27;s not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response is determined by Google Retail Search. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * &quot;rating&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = true * &quot;price&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false * &quot;brands&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enable, which generates a facet &quot;gender&quot;. Then, the final order of the facets in the response can be (&quot;price&quot;, &quot;brands&quot;, &quot;rating&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;) or (&quot;price&quot;, &quot;brands&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;rating&quot;) depends on how Google Retail Search orders &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;rating&quot; facets. However, notice that &quot;price&quot; and &quot;brands&quot; are always ranked at first and second position because their enable_dynamic_position values are false.
      &quot;excludedFilterKeys&quot;: [ # List of keys to exclude when faceting. By default, FacetKey.key is not excluded from the filter unless it is listed in this field. Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results. Using this field does not affect what search results are returned. For example, suppose there are 100 products with the color facet &quot;Red&quot; and 200 products with the color facet &quot;Blue&quot;. A query containing the filter &quot;colorFamilies:ANY(&quot;Red&quot;)&quot; and having &quot;colorFamilies&quot; as FacetKey.key would by default return only &quot;Red&quot; products in the search results, and also return &quot;Red&quot; with count 100 as the only color facet. Although there are also blue products available, &quot;Blue&quot; would not be shown as an available facet value. If &quot;colorFamilies&quot; is listed in &quot;excludedFilterKeys&quot;, then the query returns the facet values &quot;Red&quot; with count 100 and &quot;Blue&quot; with count 200, because the &quot;colorFamilies&quot; key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field doesn&#x27;t affect search results, the search results are still correctly filtered to return only &quot;Red&quot; products. A maximum of 100 values are allowed. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

The derived expire_time is returned in the output and ttl is left blank when retrieving the Product. If it is set, the product is not available for SearchService.Search after current timestamp plus ttl. However, the product can still be retrieved by ProductService.GetProduct and ProductService.ListProducts.
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of the product. Default to Catalog.product_level_config.ingestion_product_type if unset.
        &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Canonical URL directly linking to the product detail page. It is strongly recommended to provide a valid uri for the product, otherwise the service performance could be significantly degraded. This field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

        &quot;variants&quot;: [ # Output only. Product variants grouped together on primary product which share similar product attributes. It&#x27;s automatically grouped by primary_product_id for all the product variants. Only populated for Type.PRIMARY Products. Note: This field is OUTPUT_ONLY for ProductService.GetProduct. Do not set this field in API requests.

      },
      &quot;variantRollupValues&quot;: { # The rollup matching variant Product attributes. The key is one of the SearchRequest.variant_rollup_keys. The values are the merged and de-duplicated Product attributes. Notice that the rollup values are respect filter. For example, when filtering by &quot;colorFamilies:ANY(\&quot;red\&quot;)&quot; and rollup &quot;colorFamilies&quot;, only &quot;red&quot; is returned. For textual and numerical attributes, the rollup values is a list of string or double values with type google.protobuf.ListValue. For example, if there are two variants with colors &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;, the rollup values are { key: &quot;colorFamilies&quot; value { list_value { values { string_value: &quot;red&quot; } values { string_value: &quot;blue&quot; } } } } For FulfillmentInfo, the rollup values is a double value with type google.protobuf.Value. For example, `{key: &quot;pickupInStore.store1&quot; value { number_value: 10 }}` means a there are 10 variants in this product are available in the store &quot;store1&quot;.
