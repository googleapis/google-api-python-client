<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="removeControl">removeControl(servingConfig, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Disables a Control on the specified ServingConfig. The control is removed from the ServingConfig. Returns a NOT_FOUND error if the Control is not enabled for the ServingConfig.

Args:
  servingConfig: string, Required. The source ServingConfig resource name . Format: projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/catalogs/{catalog_id}/servingConfigs/{serving_config_id} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for RemoveControl method.
  &quot;controlId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The id of the control to apply. Assumed to be in the same catalog as the serving config.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Configures metadata that is used to generate serving time results (e.g. search results or recommendation predictions). The ServingConfig is passed in the search and predict request and together with the Catalog.default_branch, generates results.
  &quot;boostControlIds&quot;: [ # Condition boost specifications. If a product matches multiple conditions in the specifications, boost scores from these specifications are all applied and combined in a non-linear way. Maximum number of specifications is 100. Notice that if both ServingConfig.boost_control_ids and [SearchRequest.boost_spec] are set, the boost conditions from both places are evaluated. If a search request matches multiple boost conditions, the final boost score is equal to the sum of the boost scores from all matched boost conditions.
