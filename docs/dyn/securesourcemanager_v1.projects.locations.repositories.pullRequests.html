    &quot;ref&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Name of the branch.
    &quot;sha&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The commit at the tip of the branch.
  },
  &quot;body&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The pull request body. Provides a detailed description of the changes.
  &quot;closeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Close timestamp (if closed or merged). Cleared when pull request is re-opened.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation timestamp.
  &quot;head&quot;: { # Branch represents a branch involved in a pull request. # Immutable. The branch containing the changes to be merged.
    &quot;ref&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Name of the branch.
    &quot;sha&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The commit at the tip of the branch.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A unique identifier for a PullRequest. The number appended at the end is generated by the server. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/repositories/{repository}/pullRequests/{pull_request_id}`
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the pull request (open, closed or merged).
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The pull request title.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last updated timestamp.
}

  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the pull request resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. The special value &quot;*&quot; means full replacement.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
