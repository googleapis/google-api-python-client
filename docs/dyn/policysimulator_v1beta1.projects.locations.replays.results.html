  <pre>Lists the results of running a Replay.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The Replay whose results are listed, in the following format: `{projects|folders|organizations}/{resource-id}/locations/global/replays/{replay-id}` Example: `projects/my-project/locations/global/replays/506a5f7f-38ce-4d7d-8e03-479ce1833c36` (required)
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of ReplayResult objects to return. Defaults to 5000. The maximum value is 5000; values above 5000 are rounded down to 5000.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous Simulator.ListReplayResults call. Provide this token to retrieve the next page of results. When paginating, all other parameters provided to [Simulator.ListReplayResults[] must match the call that provided the page token.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
