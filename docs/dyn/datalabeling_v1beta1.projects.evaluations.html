  <pre>Searches evaluations within a project.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Evaluation search parent (project ID). Format: &quot;projects/ {project_id}&quot; (required)
  filter: string, Optional. To search evaluations, you can filter by the following: * evaluation_job.evaluation_job_id (the last part of EvaluationJob.name) * evaluation_job.model_id (the {model_name} portion of EvaluationJob.modelVersion) * evaluation_job.evaluation_job_run_time_start (Minimum threshold for the evaluationJobRunTime that created the evaluation) * evaluation_job.evaluation_job_run_time_end (Maximum threshold for the evaluationJobRunTime that created the evaluation) * evaluation_job.job_state (EvaluationJob.state) * annotation_spec.display_name (the Evaluation contains a metric for the annotation spec with this displayName) To filter by multiple critiera, use the `AND` operator or the `OR` operator. The following examples shows a string that filters by several critiera: &quot;evaluation_job.evaluation_job_id = {evaluation_job_id} AND evaluation_job.model_id = {model_name} AND evaluation_job.evaluation_job_run_time_start = {timestamp_1} AND evaluation_job.evaluation_job_run_time_end = {timestamp_2} AND annotation_spec.display_name = {display_name}&quot;
  pageSize: integer, Optional. Requested page size. Server may return fewer results than requested. Default value is 100.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A token identifying a page of results for the server to return. Typically obtained by the nextPageToken of the response to a previous search request. If you don&#x27;t specify this field, the API call requests the first page of the search.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
