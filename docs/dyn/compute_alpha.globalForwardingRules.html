  <pre>Deletes the specified GlobalForwardingRule resource.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  forwardingRule: string, Name of the ForwardingRule resource to delete. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents a Forwarding Rule resource. Forwarding rule resources in Google Cloud can be either regional or global in scope: * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/globalForwardingRules) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/forwardingRules) A forwarding rule and its corresponding IP address represent the frontend configuration of a Google Cloud Platform load balancer. Forwarding rules can also reference target instances and Cloud VPN Classic gateways (targetVpnGateway). For more information, read Forwarding rule concepts and Using protocol forwarding.
  &quot;IPAddress&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required under the following circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy and validateForProxyless is set to true, the IPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule&#x27;s target or backendService, and in most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). When reading an IPAddress, the API always returns the IP address number.
  &quot;IPProtocol&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol forwarding, valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP and L3_DEFAULT. The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products as described in [Load balancing features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).
  &quot;allPorts&quot;: True or False, # This field can only be used: - If IPProtocol is one of TCP, UDP, or SCTP. - By internal TCP/UDP load balancers, backend service-based network load balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding. Set this field to true to allow packets addressed to any port or packets lacking destination port information (for example, UDP fragments after the first fragment) to be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The ports, port_range, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
  &quot;allowGlobalAccess&quot;: True or False, # This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. If the field is set to TRUE, clients can access ILB from all regions. Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the internal load balancer.
  &quot;allowPscGlobalAccess&quot;: True or False, # This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
  &quot;backendService&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic. Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing; must be omitted for all other load balancer types.
  &quot;baseForwardingRule&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL for the corresponding base Forwarding Rule. By base Forwarding Rule, we mean the Forwarding Rule that has the same IP address, protocol, and port settings with the current Forwarding Rule, but without sourceIPRanges specified. Always empty if the current Forwarding Rule does not have sourceIPRanges specified.
  &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
  &quot;fingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when inserting a ForwardingRule. Include the fingerprint in patch request to ensure that you do not overwrite changes that were applied from another concurrent request. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
  &quot;ipVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The IP Version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid options are IPV4 or IPV6.
  &quot;isMirroringCollector&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#forwardingRule&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#forwardingRule for Forwarding Rule resources.
  &quot;labelFingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this resource, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.

  &quot;metadataFilters&quot;: [ # Opaque filter criteria used by load balancer to restrict routing configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In their xDS requests to load balancer, xDS clients present node metadata. When there is a match, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies. Otherwise, all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy, UrlMap) referenced by the ForwardingRule are not visible to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are specified, all of them need to be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters specified here will be applifed before those specified in the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    { # Opaque filter criteria used by load balancers to restrict routing configuration to a limited set of load balancing proxies. Proxies and sidecars involved in load balancing would typically present metadata to the load balancers that need to match criteria specified here. If a match takes place, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata. An example for using metadataFilters would be: if load balancing involves Envoys, they receive routing configuration when values in metadataFilters match values supplied in of their XDS requests to loadbalancers.
      &quot;filterLabels&quot;: [ # The list of label value pairs that must match labels in the provided metadata based on filterMatchCriteria This list must not be empty and can have at the most 64 entries.

      ],
      &quot;filterMatchCriteria&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies how individual filter label matches within the list of filterLabels and contributes toward the overall metadataFilter match. Supported values are: - MATCH_ANY: at least one of the filterLabels must have a matching label in the provided metadata. - MATCH_ALL: all filterLabels must have matching labels in the provided metadata.
    },
  ],
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter.
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This field is not used for external load balancing. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If this field is not specified, the default network will be used. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, a network must be provided.
  &quot;networkTier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD. For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM. If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the Address.
  &quot;noAutomateDnsZone&quot;: True or False, # This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field.
  &quot;portRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This field can only be used: - If IPProtocol is one of TCP, UDP, or SCTP. - By backend service-based network load balancers, target pool-based network load balancers, internal proxy load balancers, external proxy load balancers, Traffic Director, external protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN. Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See port specifications for details.

  <pre>Creates a GlobalForwardingRule resource in the specified project using the data included in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a Forwarding Rule resource. Forwarding rule resources in Google Cloud can be either regional or global in scope: * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/globalForwardingRules) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/forwardingRules) A forwarding rule and its corresponding IP address represent the frontend configuration of a Google Cloud Platform load balancer. Forwarding rules can also reference target instances and Cloud VPN Classic gateways (targetVpnGateway). For more information, read Forwarding rule concepts and Using protocol forwarding.
  &quot;IPAddress&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required under the following circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy and validateForProxyless is set to true, the IPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule&#x27;s target or backendService, and in most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). When reading an IPAddress, the API always returns the IP address number.
  &quot;IPProtocol&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol forwarding, valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP and L3_DEFAULT. The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products as described in [Load balancing features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).
  &quot;allPorts&quot;: True or False, # This field can only be used: - If IPProtocol is one of TCP, UDP, or SCTP. - By internal TCP/UDP load balancers, backend service-based network load balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding. Set this field to true to allow packets addressed to any port or packets lacking destination port information (for example, UDP fragments after the first fragment) to be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The ports, port_range, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
  &quot;allowGlobalAccess&quot;: True or False, # This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. If the field is set to TRUE, clients can access ILB from all regions. Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the internal load balancer.
  &quot;allowPscGlobalAccess&quot;: True or False, # This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region.
  &quot;backendService&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic. Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing; must be omitted for all other load balancer types.
  &quot;baseForwardingRule&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL for the corresponding base Forwarding Rule. By base Forwarding Rule, we mean the Forwarding Rule that has the same IP address, protocol, and port settings with the current Forwarding Rule, but without sourceIPRanges specified. Always empty if the current Forwarding Rule does not have sourceIPRanges specified.
  &quot;creationTimestamp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
  &quot;fingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when inserting a ForwardingRule. Include the fingerprint in patch request to ensure that you do not overwrite changes that were applied from another concurrent request. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
  &quot;ipVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The IP Version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid options are IPV4 or IPV6.
  &quot;isMirroringCollector&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#forwardingRule&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#forwardingRule for Forwarding Rule resources.
  &quot;labelFingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this resource, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  &quot;metadataFilters&quot;: [ # Opaque filter criteria used by load balancer to restrict routing configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In their xDS requests to load balancer, xDS clients present node metadata. When there is a match, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies. Otherwise, all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy, UrlMap) referenced by the ForwardingRule are not visible to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are specified, all of them need to be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters specified here will be applifed before those specified in the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    { # Opaque filter criteria used by load balancers to restrict routing configuration to a limited set of load balancing proxies. Proxies and sidecars involved in load balancing would typically present metadata to the load balancers that need to match criteria specified here. If a match takes place, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata. An example for using metadataFilters would be: if load balancing involves Envoys, they receive routing configuration when values in metadataFilters match values supplied in of their XDS requests to loadbalancers.
      &quot;filterLabels&quot;: [ # The list of label value pairs that must match labels in the provided metadata based on filterMatchCriteria This list must not be empty and can have at the most 64 entries.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of GlobalForwardingRule resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;items&quot;: [ # A list of ForwardingRule resources.
    { # Represents a Forwarding Rule resource. Forwarding rule resources in Google Cloud can be either regional or global in scope: * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/globalForwardingRules) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/forwardingRules) A forwarding rule and its corresponding IP address represent the frontend configuration of a Google Cloud Platform load balancer. Forwarding rules can also reference target instances and Cloud VPN Classic gateways (targetVpnGateway). For more information, read Forwarding rule concepts and Using protocol forwarding.
      &quot;IPAddress&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required under the following circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy and validateForProxyless is set to true, the IPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule&#x27;s target or backendService, and in most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). When reading an IPAddress, the API always returns the IP address number.

      &quot;baseForwardingRule&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL for the corresponding base Forwarding Rule. By base Forwarding Rule, we mean the Forwarding Rule that has the same IP address, protocol, and port settings with the current Forwarding Rule, but without sourceIPRanges specified.

This field will be ignored when inserting a ForwardingRule. Include the fingerprint in patch request to ensure that you do not overwrite changes that were applied from another concurrent request. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.

      &quot;isMirroringCollector&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.

The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.

For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are specified, all of them need to be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters specified here will be applifed before those specified in the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata.

Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule&#x27;s target or backendService, and in most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). When reading an IPAddress, the API always returns the IP address number.
  &quot;IPProtocol&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol forwarding, valid options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP and L3_DEFAULT. The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products as described in [Load balancing features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).

The ports, port_range, and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive.
  &quot;allowGlobalAccess&quot;: True or False, # This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance.

For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are specified, all of them need to be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters specified here will be applifed before those specified in the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setTarget">setTarget(project, forwardingRule, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Changes target URL for the GlobalForwardingRule resource. The new target should be of the same type as the old target.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  forwardingRule: string, Name of the ForwardingRule resource in which target is to be set. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;target&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
