The account may provide access to managed Google Play only, or to other Google services, depending on the identity model: - The Google managed domain identity model requires synchronization to Google account sources (via primaryEmail). - The managed Google Play Accounts identity model provides a dynamic means for enterprises to create user or device accounts as needed. These accounts provide access to managed Google Play.
  &quot;accountIdentifier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique identifier you create for this user, such as &quot;user342&quot; or &quot;asset#44418&quot;. Do not use personally identifiable information (PII) for this property. Must always be set for EMM-managed users. Not set for Google-managed users.
  &quot;accountType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of account that this user represents. A userAccount can be installed on multiple devices, but a deviceAccount is specific to a single device. An EMM-managed user (emmManaged) can be either type (userAccount, deviceAccount), but a Google-managed user (googleManaged) is always a userAccount.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name that will appear in user interfaces. Setting this property is optional when creating EMM-managed users. If you do set this property, use something generic about the organization (such as &quot;Example, Inc.&quot;) or your name (as EMM). Not used for Google-managed user accounts. @mutable androidenterprise.users.update
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique ID for the user.
  &quot;managementType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The entity that manages the user. With googleManaged users, the source of truth is Google so EMMs have to make sure a Google Account exists for the user. With emmManaged users, the EMM is in charge.
  &quot;primaryEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The user&#x27;s primary email address, for example, &quot;jsmith@example.com&quot;. Will always be set for Google managed users and not set for EMM managed users.
