<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(project, zone)</code>
  <pre>Returns the specified Zone resource. Get a list of available zones by making a list() request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, Name of the zone resource to return. (required)

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A Zone resource.
    "status": "A String", # [Output Only] Status of the zone, either UP or DOWN.
    "kind": "compute#zone", # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#zone for zones.
    "description": "A String", # [Output Only] Textual description of the resource.
    "deprecated": { # Deprecation status for a public resource. # [Output Only] The deprecation status associated with this zone.
      "deleted": "A String", # An optional RFC3339 timestamp on or after which the state of this resource is intended to change to DELETED. This is only informational and the status will not change unless the client explicitly changes it.
      "deprecated": "A String", # An optional RFC3339 timestamp on or after which the state of this resource is intended to change to DEPRECATED. This is only informational and the status will not change unless the client explicitly changes it.
      "state": "A String", # The deprecation state of this resource. This can be DEPRECATED, OBSOLETE, or DELETED. Operations which create a new resource using a DEPRECATED resource will return successfully, but with a warning indicating the deprecated resource and recommending its replacement. Operations which use OBSOLETE or DELETED resources will be rejected and result in an error.
      "obsolete": "A String", # An optional RFC3339 timestamp on or after which the state of this resource is intended to change to OBSOLETE. This is only informational and the status will not change unless the client explicitly changes it.
      "replacement": "A String", # The URL of the suggested replacement for a deprecated resource. The suggested replacement resource must be the same kind of resource as the deprecated resource.
    },
    "region": "A String", # [Output Only] Full URL reference to the region which hosts the zone.
    "creationTimestamp": "A String", # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
    "id": "A String", # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
    "selfLink": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    "name": "A String", # [Output Only] Name of the resource.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of Zone resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Contains a list of zone resources.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.
    "items": [ # [Output Only] A list of Zone resources.
      { # A Zone resource.
        "status": "A String", # [Output Only] Status of the zone, either UP or DOWN.
