Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast.

If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there&#x27;s usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="restore">restore(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Restores the specified agent from a binary file. Replaces the current agent with a new one. Note that all existing resources in agent (e.g. intents, entity types, flows) will be removed. This method is a [long-running operation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/how/long-running-operation). The returned `Operation` type has the following method-specific fields: - `metadata`: An empty [Struct message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#struct) - `response`: An [Empty message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#empty) Note: You should always train flows prior to sending them queries. See the [training documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/training).

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the agent to restore into. Format: `projects//locations//agents/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for Agents.RestoreAgent.
  &quot;agentContent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Uncompressed raw byte content for agent.
  &quot;agentUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/) URI to restore agent from. The format of this URI must be `gs:///`. Dialogflow performs a read operation for the Cloud Storage object on the caller&#x27;s behalf, so your request authentication must have read permissions for the object. For more information, see [Dialogflow access control](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/access-control#storage).
  &quot;restoreOption&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Agent restore mode. If not specified, `KEEP` is assumed.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {

    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
