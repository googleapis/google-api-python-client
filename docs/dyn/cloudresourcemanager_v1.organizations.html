<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">

  <pre>Clears a `Policy` from a resource.

Args:
  resource: string, Name of the resource for the `Policy` to clear. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to the ClearOrgPolicy method.
    "etag": "A String", # The current version, for concurrency control. Not sending an `etag`
        # will cause the `Policy` to be cleared blindly.

  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request

      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getEffectiveOrgPolicy">getEffectiveOrgPolicy(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the effective `Policy` on a resource. This is the result of merging
`Policies` in the resource hierarchy. The returned `Policy` will not have

        # fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes.
        # The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values.
        # The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only
        # if the value contains a ":". Values prefixed with "is:" are treated the
        # same as values with no prefix.

        # `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is
        # `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all

          # resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are
          # added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.
          #
          # Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied
          # values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration
          # simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
          # `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
          # In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
          # not present in `denied_values`.

          # `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.
          # Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that
          # restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a
          # `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has
          # `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,
          # then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.

Authorization requires the Google IAM permission
`resourcemanager.organizations.getIamPolicy` on the specified organization

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

        # `etag` will be unset.
        #
        # When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value
        # that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a
        # read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the `etag`in a
