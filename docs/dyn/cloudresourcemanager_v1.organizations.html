  <pre>Clears a `Policy` from a resource.

Args:
  resource: string, Name of the resource for the `Policy` to clear. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to the ClearOrgPolicy method.
    "etag": "A String", # The current version, for concurrency control. Not sending an `etag`

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request

      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified Organization.
The `resource` field should be the organization's resource name,
e.g. "organizations/123".

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
  }</pre>
