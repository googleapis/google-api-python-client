  <pre>Clears a `Policy` from a resource.

Args:
  resource: string, Name of the resource for the `Policy` to clear. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to the ClearOrgPolicy method.
    &quot;constraint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the `Constraint` of the `Policy` to clear.
    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The current version, for concurrency control. Not sending an `etag`

  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:

      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getEffectiveOrgPolicy">getEffectiveOrgPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the effective `Policy` on a resource. This is the result of merging
`Policies` in the resource hierarchy. The returned `Policy` will not have
an `etag`set because it is a computed `Policy` across multiple resources.
Subtrees of Resource Manager resource hierarchy with &#x27;under:&#x27; prefix will
not be expanded.

Args:
  resource: string, The name of the resource to start computing the effective `Policy`. (required)

        # fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes.
        # The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values.
        # The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only
        # if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the
        # same as values with no prefix.

      ],
      &quot;suggestedValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The Google Cloud Console will try to default to a configuration
          # that matches the value specified in this `Policy`. If `suggested_value`
          # is not set, it will inherit the value specified higher in the hierarchy,
          # unless `inherit_from_parent` is `false`.
      &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`.
          #
          # By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supercedes any `Policy` set
          # anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is
          # set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent
          # resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are
          # added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.
          #
          # Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied
          # values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration
          # simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
          # `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
          # In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
          # not present in `denied_values`.
          #
          # For example, suppose you have a `Constraint`
          # `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of
          # `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.
          # Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that
          # restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a
          # `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has
          # `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,
          # then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.

    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for an Organization resource. May be empty
if no such policy or resource exists. The `resource` field should be the
organization&#x27;s resource name, e.g. &quot;organizations/123&quot;.

Authorization requires the Google IAM permission
`resourcemanager.organizations.getIamPolicy` on the specified organization

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.
    &quot;options&quot;: { # Encapsulates settings provided to GetIamPolicy. # OPTIONAL: A `GetPolicyOptions` object for specifying options to
        # `GetIamPolicy`.
      &quot;requestedPolicyVersion&quot;: 42, # Optional. The policy format version to be returned.
          #
          # Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
          # rejected.
          #
          # Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.
          # Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
          # leave the field unset.
          #
          # To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.

        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may

If no `Policy` is set on the resource, a `Policy` is returned with default
values including `POLICY_TYPE_NOT_SET` for the `policy_type oneof`. The
`etag` value can be used with `SetOrgPolicy()` to create or update a
`Policy` during read-modify-write.

Args:
  resource: string, Name of the resource the `Policy` is set on. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request sent to the GetOrgPolicy method.
    &quot;constraint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the `Constraint` to get the `Policy`.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

        # are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values`
        # fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes.
        # The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values.
        # The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only
        # if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the
        # same as values with no prefix.
        # Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats:
        #     - &quot;projects/&lt;project-id&gt;&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot;
        #     - &quot;folders/&lt;folder-id&gt;&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot;
        #     - &quot;organizations/&lt;organization-id&gt;&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot;
        # The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint`  defines whether
        # ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and
        # `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is
        # `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all
        # values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`,
        # `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset.
      &quot;allValues&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The policy all_values state.
      &quot;allowedValues&quot;: [ # List of values allowed  at this resource. Can only be set if `all_values`
          # is set to `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;suggestedValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The Google Cloud Console will try to default to a configuration
          # that matches the value specified in this `Policy`. If `suggested_value`
          # is not set, it will inherit the value specified higher in the hierarchy,
          # unless `inherit_from_parent` is `false`.
      &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`.
          #
          # By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supercedes any `Policy` set
          # anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is
          # set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent
          # resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are
          # added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.
          #
          # Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied
          # values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration
          # simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
          # `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
          # In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
          # not present in `denied_values`.
          #
          # For example, suppose you have a `Constraint`
          # `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of
          # `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.
          # Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that
          # restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a
          # `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has
          # `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,
          # then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.

              # Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied
              # values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration

              # In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and
              # not present in `denied_values`.

              # For example, suppose you have a `Constraint`

              # `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`.

              # `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY,

        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
        # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
        # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
        # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
        # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
        # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

      &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
          # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
          # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
          # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
          # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
          # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
          # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
          #
          # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
          # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
          # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
          # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
      &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.
          #
          # Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value
          # are rejected.
          #
          # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
          # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
          #
          # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
          # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
          # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
          # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
          #   that includes conditions
          #
          # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
          # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
          # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
          # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
          #
          # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
          # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.
        #

        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

          # Suppose you have a `Constraint`
          # `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default`
          # set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following
          # behavior:
          #   - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial
          #     port connection attempts will be allowed.
          #   - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial
          #     port connection attempts will be refused.
          #   - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port
          #     connection attempts will be allowed.
          #   - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the
          #     resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed.
          #   - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the
          #     resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at
          #     this resource.
          #
          # The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings:
          #
          # Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins):
          #   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {enforced: false}
          #   `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set.
          # The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be
          # enforced.
          #
          # Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced):
          #   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {enforced: false}
          #   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {enforced: true}
          # The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced.
          # The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced.
          #
          # Example 3 (RestoreDefault):
          #   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {enforced: true}
          #   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
          #     {RestoreDefault: {}}
          # The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified Organization.
The `resource` field should be the organization&#x27;s resource name,
e.g. &quot;organizations/123&quot;.

There are no permissions required for making this API call.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],

      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
