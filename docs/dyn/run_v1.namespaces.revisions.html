  <pre>Delete a revision.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the revision to delete. For Cloud Run (fully managed), replace {namespace} with the project ID or number. It takes the form namespaces/{namespace}. For example: namespaces/PROJECT_ID (required)
  apiVersion: string, Cloud Run currently ignores this parameter.
  dryRun: string, Indicates that the server should validate the request and populate default values without persisting the request. Supported values: `all`
  kind: string, Cloud Run currently ignores this parameter.
  propagationPolicy: string, Specifies the propagation policy of delete. Cloud Run currently ignores this setting, and deletes in the background.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
