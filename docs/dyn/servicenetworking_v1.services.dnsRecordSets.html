    <code class="details" id="add">add(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Service producers can use this method to add DNS record sets to private DNS zones in the shared producer host project.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The service that is managing peering connectivity for a service producer&#x27;s organization. For Google services that support this functionality, this value is `services/servicenetworking.googleapis.com`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to add a record set to a private managed DNS zone in the shared producer host project.
  &quot;consumerNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The network that the consumer is using to connect with services. Must be in the form of projects/{project}/global/networks/{network} {project} is the project number, as in &#x27;12345&#x27; {network} is the network name.
  &quot;dnsRecordSet&quot;: { # Represents a DNS record set resource. # Required. The DNS record set to add.
    &quot;data&quot;: [ # Required. As defined in RFC 1035 (section 5) and RFC 1034 (section 3.6.1) for examples see https://cloud.google.com/dns/records/json-record.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The DNS or domain name of the record set, e.g. `test.example.com`.
    &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The period of time for which this RecordSet can be cached by resolvers.
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The identifier of a supported record type.
  },
  &quot;zone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the private DNS zone in the shared producer host project to which the record set will be added.
}

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
