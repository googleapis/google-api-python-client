<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates an instance and begins preparing it to begin serving. The
returned long-running operation
can be used to track the progress of preparing the new
instance. The instance name is assigned by the caller. If the
named instance already exists, `CreateInstance` returns
`ALREADY_EXISTS`.

Immediately upon completion of this request:

  * The instance is readable via the API, with all requested attributes
    but no allocated resources. Its state is `CREATING`.

Until completion of the returned operation:

  * Cancelling the operation renders the instance immediately unreadable
    via the API.
  * The instance can be deleted.
  * All other attempts to modify the instance are rejected.

Upon completion of the returned operation:

  * Billing for all successfully-allocated resources begins (some types
    may have lower than the requested levels).
  * Databases can be created in the instance.
  * The instance&#x27;s allocated resource levels are readable via the API.
  * The instance&#x27;s state becomes `READY`.

The returned long-running operation will
have a name of the format `&lt;instance_name&gt;/operations/&lt;operation_id&gt;` and
can be used to track creation of the instance.  The
metadata field type is
CreateInstanceMetadata.
The response field type is
Instance, if successful.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project in which to create the instance. Values
are of the form `projects/&lt;project&gt;`. (required)

  <pre>Sets the access control policy on an instance resource. Replaces any
existing policy.

Authorization requires `spanner.instances.setIamPolicy` on
resource.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The Cloud Spanner resource for which the policy is being set. The format is `projects/&lt;project ID&gt;/instances/&lt;instance ID&gt;` for instance resources and `projects/&lt;project ID&gt;/instances/&lt;instance ID&gt;/databases/&lt;database ID&gt;` for databases resources. (required)

    The object takes the form of:

        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the

        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows

        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions

        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that the caller has on the specified instance resource.

Attempting this RPC on a non-existent Cloud Spanner instance resource will
result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has `spanner.instances.list`
permission on the containing Google Cloud Project. Otherwise returns an
empty set of permissions.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The Cloud Spanner resource for which permissions are being tested. The format is `projects/&lt;project ID&gt;/instances/&lt;instance ID&gt;` for instance resources and `projects/&lt;project ID&gt;/instances/&lt;instance ID&gt;/databases/&lt;database ID&gt;` for database resources. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # REQUIRED: The set of permissions to check for &#x27;resource&#x27;.
        # Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.instances.*&#x27;) are not allowed.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
