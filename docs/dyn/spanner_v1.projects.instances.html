<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates an instance and begins preparing it to begin serving. The
returned long-running operation
can be used to track the progress of preparing the new
instance. The instance name is assigned by the caller. If the
named instance already exists, `CreateInstance` returns
`ALREADY_EXISTS`.

Immediately upon completion of this request:

  * The instance is readable via the API, with all requested attributes
    but no allocated resources. Its state is `CREATING`.

Until completion of the returned operation:

  * Cancelling the operation renders the instance immediately unreadable
    via the API.
  * The instance can be deleted.
  * All other attempts to modify the instance are rejected.

Upon completion of the returned operation:

  * Billing for all successfully-allocated resources begins (some types
    may have lower than the requested levels).
  * Databases can be created in the instance.
  * The instance's allocated resource levels are readable via the API.
  * The instance's state becomes `READY`.

The returned long-running operation will
have a name of the format `<instance_name>/operations/<operation_id>` and
can be used to track creation of the instance.  The
metadata field type is
CreateInstanceMetadata.
The response field type is
Instance, if successful.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
        # message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of

        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates an instance, and begins allocating or releasing resources
as requested. The returned long-running
operation can be used to track the
progress of updating the instance. If the named instance does not
exist, returns `NOT_FOUND`.

Immediately upon completion of this request:

  * For resource types for which a decrease in the instance's allocation
    has been requested, billing is based on the newly-requested level.

Until completion of the returned operation:

  * Cancelling the operation sets its metadata's
    cancel_time, and begins
    restoring resources to their pre-request values. The operation
    is guaranteed to succeed at undoing all resource changes,
    after which point it terminates with a `CANCELLED` status.
  * All other attempts to modify the instance are rejected.
  * Reading the instance via the API continues to give the pre-request
    resource levels.

Upon completion of the returned operation:

  * Billing begins for all successfully-allocated resources (some types
    may have lower than the requested levels).
  * All newly-reserved resources are available for serving the instance's
    tables.
  * The instance's new resource levels are readable via the API.

metadata field type is
UpdateInstanceMetadata.
The response field type is

    },
    "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
        # message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that the caller has on the specified instance resource.

Attempting this RPC on a non-existent Cloud Spanner instance resource will
result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has `spanner.instances.list`
permission on the containing Google Cloud Project. Otherwise returns an
empty set of permissions.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The Cloud Spanner resource for which permissions are being tested. The format is `projects/<project ID>/instances/<instance ID>` for instance resources and `projects/<project ID>/instances/<instance ID>/databases/<database ID>` for database resources. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # REQUIRED: The set of permissions to check for 'resource'.
        # Permissions with wildcards (such as '*', 'spanner.*', 'spanner.instances.*') are not allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
