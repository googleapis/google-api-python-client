    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the instance was created.
    &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The descriptive name for this instance as it appears in UIs. Must be unique per project and between 4 and 30 characters in length.

      &quot;expireBehavior&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the expiration behavior of a free instance. The default of ExpireBehavior is `REMOVE_AFTER_GRACE_PERIOD`. This can be modified during or after creation, and before expiration.
      &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp after which the instance will either be upgraded or scheduled for deletion after a grace period. ExpireBehavior is used to choose between upgrading or scheduling the free instance for deletion. This timestamp is set during the creation of a free instance.
      &quot;upgradeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. If present, the timestamp at which the free instance was upgraded to a provisioned instance.

Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.

  <pre>Gets the access control policy for an instance resource. Returns an empty policy if an instance exists but does not have a policy set. Authorization requires `spanner.instances.getIamPolicy` on resource.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The Cloud Spanner resource for which the policy is being retrieved. The format is `projects//instances/` for instance resources and `projects//instances//databases/` for database resources. (required)

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
