    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project for which a list of instances is requested. Values are of the form `projects/`. (required)
  filter: string, An expression for filtering the results of the request. Filter rules are case insensitive. The fields eligible for filtering are: * `name` * `display_name` * `labels.key` where key is the name of a label Some examples of using filters are: * `name:*` --&gt; The instance has a name. * `name:Howl` --&gt; The instance&#x27;s name contains the string &quot;howl&quot;. * `name:HOWL` --&gt; Equivalent to above. * `NAME:howl` --&gt; Equivalent to above. * `labels.env:*` --&gt; The instance has the label &quot;env&quot;. * `labels.env:dev` --&gt; The instance has the label &quot;env&quot; and the value of the label contains the string &quot;dev&quot;. * `name:howl labels.env:dev` --&gt; The instance&#x27;s name contains &quot;howl&quot; and it has the label &quot;env&quot; with its value containing &quot;dev&quot;.

For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted.

For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that the caller has on the specified instance resource. Attempting this RPC on a non-existent Cloud Spanner instance resource will result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has `spanner.instances.list` permission on the containing Google Cloud Project. Otherwise returns an empty set of permissions.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The Cloud Spanner resource for which permissions are being tested. The format is `projects//instances/` for instance resources and `projects//instances//databases/` for database resources. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # REQUIRED: The set of permissions to check for &#x27;resource&#x27;. Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.instances.*&#x27;) are not allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
