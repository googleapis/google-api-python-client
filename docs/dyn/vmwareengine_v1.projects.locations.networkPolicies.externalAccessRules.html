  <pre>Creates a new external access rule in a given network policy.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the network policy to create a new external access firewall rule in. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/networkPolicies/my-policy` (required)

The specified IP addresses must have reserved external IP addresses in the scope of the parent network policy. To match all external IP addresses in the scope of the parent network policy, specify `0.0.0.0/0`. To match a specific external IP address, specify it using the `IpRange.external_address` property.
    { # An IP range provided in any one of the supported formats.
      &quot;externalAddress&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of an `ExternalAddress` resource. The external address must have been reserved in the scope of this external access rule&#x27;s parent network policy. Provide the external address name in the form of `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/privateClouds/{private_cloud}/externalAddresses/{external_address}`.

    &quot;A String&quot;,

  &quot;ipProtocol&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The IP protocol to which the external access rule applies. This value can be one of the following three protocol strings (not case-sensitive): `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp`.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of this external access rule. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/networkPolicies/my-policy/externalAccessRules/my-rule`
  &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # External access rule priority, which determines the external access rule to use when multiple rules apply. If multiple rules have the same priority, their ordering is non-deterministic. If specific ordering is required, assign unique priorities to enforce such ordering. The external access rule priority is an integer from 100 to 4096, both inclusive. Lower integers indicate higher precedence. For example, a rule with priority `100` has higher precedence than a rule with priority `101`.
  &quot;sourceIpRanges&quot;: [ # If source ranges are specified, the external access rule applies only to traffic that has a source IP address in these ranges. These ranges can either be expressed in the CIDR format or as an IP address. As only inbound rules are supported, `ExternalAddress` resources cannot be the source IP addresses of an external access rule. To match all source addresses, specify `0.0.0.0/0`.

  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of this resource.
}

  externalAccessRuleId: string, Required. The user-provided identifier of the `ExternalAccessRule` to be created. This identifier must be unique among `ExternalAccessRule` resources within the parent and becomes the final token in the name URI. The identifier must meet the following requirements: * Only contains 1-63 alphanumeric characters and hyphens * Begins with an alphabetical character * Ends with a non-hyphen character * Not formatted as a UUID * Complies with [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) (section 3.5)
  requestId: string, A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`. For example, if you are filtering a list of external access rules, you can exclude the ones named `example-rule` by specifying `name != &quot;example-rule&quot;`. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = &quot;example-rule&quot;) (createTime &gt; &quot;2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (name = &quot;example-rule-1&quot;) AND (createTime &gt; &quot;2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z&quot;) OR (name = &quot;example-rule-2&quot;) ```
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned results are ordered by `name` in ascending order. You can also sort results in descending order based on the `name` value using `orderBy=&quot;name desc&quot;`. Currently, only ordering by `name` is supported.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of external access rules to return in one page. The service may return fewer than this value. The maximum value is coerced to 1000. The default value of this field is 500.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListExternalAccessRulesRequest` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListExternalAccessRulesRequest` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

}

  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `ExternalAccessRule` resource by the update. The fields specified in the `update_mask` are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
