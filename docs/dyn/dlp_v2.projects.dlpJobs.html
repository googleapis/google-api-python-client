  <pre>Lists DlpJobs that match the specified filter in the request. See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/inspecting-storage and https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/compute-risk-analysis to learn more.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. The format of this value varies depending on whether you have [specified a processing location](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/specifying-location): + Projects scope, location specified: `projects/`PROJECT_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID + Projects scope, no location specified (defaults to global): `projects/`PROJECT_ID The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  filter: string, Allows filtering. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * Supported fields/values for inspect jobs: - `state` - PENDING|RUNNING|CANCELED|FINISHED|FAILED - `inspected_storage` - DATASTORE|CLOUD_STORAGE|BIGQUERY - `trigger_name` - The name of the trigger that created the job. - &#x27;end_time` - Corresponds to the time the job finished. - &#x27;start_time` - Corresponds to the time the job finished. * Supported fields for risk analysis jobs: - `state` - RUNNING|CANCELED|FINISHED|FAILED - &#x27;end_time` - Corresponds to the time the job finished. - &#x27;start_time` - Corresponds to the time the job finished. * The operator must be `=` or `!=`. Examples: * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND state = done * inspected_storage = cloud_storage OR inspected_storage = bigquery * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND (state = done OR state = canceled) * end_time &gt; \&quot;2017-12-12T00:00:00+00:00\&quot; The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
  locationId: string, Deprecated. This field has no effect.
  orderBy: string, Comma separated list of fields to order by, followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case-insensitive, default sorting order is ascending, redundant space characters are insignificant. Example: `name asc, end_time asc, create_time desc` Supported fields are: - `create_time`: corresponds to the time the job was created. - `end_time`: corresponds to the time the job ended. - `name`: corresponds to the job&#x27;s name. - `state`: corresponds to `state`
  pageSize: integer, The standard list page size.
  pageToken: string, The standard list page token.
  type: string, The type of job. Defaults to `DlpJobType.INSPECT`
    Allowed values
      DLP_JOB_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED - Defaults to INSPECT_JOB.
      INSPECT_JOB - The job inspected Google Cloud for sensitive data.
      RISK_ANALYSIS_JOB - The job executed a Risk Analysis computation.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Additionally, the characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to non-letters and digits next to non-digits.
