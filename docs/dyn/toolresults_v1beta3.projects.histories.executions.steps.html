Steps can overlap (for instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are done in parallel). Here is an example, let&#x27;s consider that we have a continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates an TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE A Step can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable.

Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&amp;foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &amp;pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &amp;pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use &#x27;type.googleapis.com/full.type.name&#x27; as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last &#x27;/&#x27; in the type URL, for example &quot;foo.bar.com/x/y.z&quot; will yield type name &quot;y.z&quot;. # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person&quot;, &quot;firstName&quot;: , &quot;lastName&quot;: } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1.212s&quot; } # Warning message with additional details of the issue.

This string must contain at least one &quot;/&quot; character. The last segment of the URL&#x27;s path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading &quot;.&quot; is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.

Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&amp;foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &amp;pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &amp;pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use &#x27;type.googleapis.com/full.type.name&#x27; as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last &#x27;/&#x27; in the type URL, for example &quot;foo.bar.com/x/y.z&quot; will yield type name &quot;y.z&quot;. # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person&quot;, &quot;firstName&quot;: , &quot;lastName&quot;: } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1.212s&quot; } # Warning message with additional details of the issue.

The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading &quot;.&quot; is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.

    { # A Step represents a single operation performed as part of Execution. A step can be used to represent the execution of a tool ( for example a test runner execution or an execution of a compiler). Steps can overlap (for instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are done in parallel). Here is an example, let&#x27;s consider that we have a continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates an TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE A Step can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable.

        &quot;warning&quot;: { #  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message. Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&amp;foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &amp;pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &amp;pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use &#x27;type.googleapis.com/full.type.name&#x27; as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last &#x27;/&#x27; in the type URL, for example &quot;foo.bar.com/x/y.z&quot; will yield type name &quot;y.z&quot;. # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person&quot;, &quot;firstName&quot;: , &quot;lastName&quot;: } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1.212s&quot; } # Warning message with additional details of the issue. Should always be a message from com.google.devtools.toolresults.v1.warnings
          &quot;typeUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least one &quot;/&quot; character. The last segment of the URL&#x27;s path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading &quot;.&quot; is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.

  <pre>Lists Steps for a given Execution. The steps are sorted by creation_time in descending order. The step_id key will be used to order the steps with the same creation_time. May return any of the following canonical error codes: - PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to read project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - FAILED_PRECONDITION - if an argument in the request happens to be invalid; e.g. if an attempt is made to list the children of a nonexistent Step - NOT_FOUND - if the containing Execution does not exist

Args:
  projectId: string, A Project id. Required. (required)
  historyId: string, A History id. Required. (required)
  executionId: string, A Execution id. Required. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of Steps to fetch. Default value: 25. The server will use this default if the field is not set or has a value of 0. Optional.
  pageToken: string, A continuation token to resume the query at the next item. Optional.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for StepService.List.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A continuation token to resume the query at the next item. If set, indicates that there are more steps to read, by calling list again with this value in the page_token field.

    { # A Step represents a single operation performed as part of Execution. A step can be used to represent the execution of a tool ( for example a test runner execution or an execution of a compiler). Steps can overlap (for instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are done in parallel). Here is an example, let&#x27;s consider that we have a continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates an TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE A Step can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable.

Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&amp;foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &amp;pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &amp;pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use &#x27;type.googleapis.com/full.type.name&#x27; as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last &#x27;/&#x27; in the type URL, for example &quot;foo.bar.com/x/y.z&quot; will yield type name &quot;y.z&quot;. # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person&quot;, &quot;firstName&quot;: , &quot;lastName&quot;: } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1.212s&quot; } # Warning message with additional details of the issue.

The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading &quot;.&quot; is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.

Steps can overlap (for instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are done in parallel). Here is an example, let&#x27;s consider that we have a continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates an TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE A Step can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable.

Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&amp;foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &amp;pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &amp;pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use &#x27;type.googleapis.com/full.type.name&#x27; as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last &#x27;/&#x27; in the type URL, for example &quot;foo.bar.com/x/y.z&quot; will yield type name &quot;y.z&quot;. # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person&quot;, &quot;firstName&quot;: , &quot;lastName&quot;: } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1.212s&quot; } # Warning message with additional details of the issue.

This string must contain at least one &quot;/&quot; character. The last segment of the URL&#x27;s path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading &quot;.&quot; is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.

    { # A Step represents a single operation performed as part of Execution. A step can be used to represent the execution of a tool ( for example a test runner execution or an execution of a compiler). Steps can overlap (for instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are done in parallel). Here is an example, let&#x27;s consider that we have a continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates an TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE A Step can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable.

Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&amp;foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &amp;pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &amp;pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use &#x27;type.googleapis.com/full.type.name&#x27; as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last &#x27;/&#x27; in the type URL, for example &quot;foo.bar.com/x/y.z&quot; will yield type name &quot;y.z&quot;. # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person&quot;, &quot;firstName&quot;: , &quot;lastName&quot;: } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1.212s&quot; } # Warning message with additional details of the issue.

The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading &quot;.&quot; is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.

    { # A Step represents a single operation performed as part of Execution. A step can be used to represent the execution of a tool ( for example a test runner execution or an execution of a compiler). Steps can overlap (for instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are done in parallel). Here is an example, let&#x27;s consider that we have a continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates an TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE A Step can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable.

        &quot;warning&quot;: { #  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message. Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&amp;foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &amp;pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &amp;pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use &#x27;type.googleapis.com/full.type.name&#x27; as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last &#x27;/&#x27; in the type URL, for example &quot;foo.bar.com/x/y.z&quot; will yield type name &quot;y.z&quot;. # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person&quot;, &quot;firstName&quot;: , &quot;lastName&quot;: } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message google.protobuf.Duration): { &quot;@type&quot;: &quot;type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;1.212s&quot; } # Warning message with additional details of the issue.

          &quot;typeUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least one &quot;/&quot; character. The last segment of the URL&#x27;s path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading &quot;.&quot; is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.
