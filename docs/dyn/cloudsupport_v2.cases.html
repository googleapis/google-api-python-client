You can specify multiple values for priority using the `OR` operator. For example, `priority=P1 OR priority=P2`. - `creator.email`: The email address of the case creator. EXAMPLES: - `state=CLOSED` - `state=OPEN AND creator.email=&quot;tester@example.com&quot;` - `state=OPEN AND (priority=P0 OR priority=P1)`

  updateMask: string, A list of attributes of the case that should be updated. Supported values are `priority`, `display_name`, and `subscriber_email_addresses`. If no fields are specified, all supported fields are updated. Be careful - if you do not provide a field mask, then you might accidentally clear some fields. For example, if you leave the field mask empty and do not provide a value for `subscriber_email_addresses`, then `subscriber_email_addresses` is updated to empty.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A Case is an object that contains the details of a support case. It contains fields for the time it was created, its priority, its classification, and more. Cases can also have comments and attachments that get added over time. A case is parented by a Google Cloud organization or project. Organizations are identified by a number, so the name of a case parented by an organization would look like this: ``` organizations/123/cases/456 ``` Projects have two unique identifiers, an ID and a number, and they look like this: ``` projects/abc/cases/456 ``` ``` projects/123/cases/456 ``` You can use either of them when calling the API. To learn more about project identifiers, see [AIP-2510](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510).
  &quot;classification&quot;: { # A Case Classification represents the topic that a case is about. It&#x27;s very important to use accurate classifications, because they&#x27;re used to route your cases to specialists who can help you.

    &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A display name for the classification. The display name is not static and can change. To uniquely and consistently identify classifications, use the `CaseClassification.id` field.
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique ID for a classification. Must be specified for case creation. To retrieve valid classification IDs for case creation, use `caseClassifications.search`. Classification IDs returned by `caseClassifications.search` are guaranteed to be valid for at least 6 months. If a given classification is deactiveated, it will immediately stop being returned. After 6 months, `case.create` requests using the classification ID will fail.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="search">search(parent, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, query=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Search for cases using a query. EXAMPLES: cURL: ```shell parent=&quot;projects/some-project&quot; curl \ --header &quot;Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)&quot; \ &quot;https://cloudsupport.googleapis.com/v2/$parent/cases:search&quot; ``` Python: ```python import googleapiclient.discovery api_version = &quot;v2&quot; supportApiService = googleapiclient.discovery.build( serviceName=&quot;cloudsupport&quot;, version=api_version, discoveryServiceUrl=f&quot;https://cloudsupport.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version={api_version}&quot;, ) request = supportApiService.cases().search( parent=&quot;projects/some-project&quot;, query=&quot;state=OPEN&quot; ) print(request.execute()) ```

Args:
  parent: string, The name of the parent resource to search for cases under. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of cases fetched with each request. The default page size is 10.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying the page of results to return. If unspecified, the first page is retrieved.
  query: string, An expression used to filter cases. Expressions use the following fields separated by `AND` and specified with `=`: - `organization`: An organization name in the form `organizations/`. - `project`: A project name in the form `projects/`. - `state`: Can be `OPEN` or `CLOSED`. - `priority`: Can be `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, or `P4`. You can specify multiple values for priority using the `OR` operator. For example, `priority=P1 OR priority=P2`. - `creator.email`: The email address of the case creator. You must specify either `organization` or `project`. To search across `displayName`, `description`, and comments, use a global restriction with no keyword or operator. For example, `&quot;my search&quot;`. To search only cases updated after a certain date, use `update_time` restricted with that particular date, time, and timezone in ISO datetime format. For example, `update_time&gt;&quot;2020-01-01T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. `update_time` only supports the greater than operator (`&gt;`). Examples: - `organization=&quot;organizations/123456789&quot;` - `project=&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;` - `project=&quot;projects/123456789&quot;` - `organization=&quot;organizations/123456789&quot; AND state=CLOSED` - `project=&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot; AND creator.email=&quot;tester@example.com&quot;` - `project=&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot; AND (priority=P0 OR priority=P1)`
