<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, uniqueWriterIdentity=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a sink that exports specified log entries to a destination. The export of newly-ingested log entries begins immediately, unless the current time is outside the sink's start and end times or the sink's writer_identity is not permitted to write to the destination. A sink can export log entries only from the resource owning the sink.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource in which to create the sink:
"projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
"organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]"
Examples: "projects/my-logging-project", "organizations/123456789". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a sink used to export log entries to one of the following destinations in any project: a Cloud Storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, or a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. A logs filter controls which log entries are exported. The sink must be created within a project or organization.
    "endTime": "A String", # Optional. The time at which this sink will stop exporting log entries. Log entries are exported only if their timestamp is earlier than the end time. If this field is not supplied, there is no end time. If both a start time and an end time are provided, then the end time must be later than the start time.
    "name": "A String", # Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example: "my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub". Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
    "destination": "A String", # Required. The export destination:
        # "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"
        # "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]"
        # "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"
        # The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs With Sinks.
    "filter": "A String", # Optional. An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter. The filter must use the log entry format specified by the output_version_format parameter. For example, in the v2 format:
        # logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND severity>=ERROR
    "startTime": "A String", # Optional. The time at which this sink will begin exporting log entries. Log entries are exported only if their timestamp is not earlier than the start time. The default value of this field is the time the sink is created or updated.
    "outputVersionFormat": "A String", # Optional. The log entry format to use for this sink's exported log entries. The v2 format is used by default. The v1 format is deprecated and should be used only as part of a migration effort to v2. See Migration to the v2 API.
    "writerIdentity": "A String", # Output only. An IAM identity&mdash;a service account or group&mdash;under which Stackdriver Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update, based on the setting of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting access for a resource. Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.
  }

  uniqueWriterIdentity: boolean, Optional. Determines the kind of IAM identity returned as writer_identity in the new sink. If this value is omitted or set to false, and if the sink's parent is a project, then the value returned as writer_identity is cloud-logs@google.com, the same identity used before the addition of writer identities to this API. The sink's destination must be in the same project as the sink itself.If this field is set to true, or if the sink is owned by a non-project resource such as an organization, then the value of writer_identity will be a unique service account used only for exports from the new sink. For more information, see writer_identity in LogSink.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

      1 - v1 error format

  uniqueWriterIdentity: boolean, Optional. See sinks.create for a description of this field. When updating a sink, the effect of this field on the value of writer_identity in the updated sink depends on both the old and new values of this field:
