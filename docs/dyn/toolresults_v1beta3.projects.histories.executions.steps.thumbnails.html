  <pre>Lists thumbnails of images attached to a step. May return any of the following canonical error codes: - PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to read from the project, or from any of the images - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - NOT_FOUND - if the step does not exist, or if any of the images do not exist

Args:
  projectId: string, A Project id. Required. (required)
  historyId: string, A History id. Required. (required)
  executionId: string, An Execution id. Required. (required)
  stepId: string, A Step id. Required. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of thumbnails to fetch. Default value: 50. The server will use this default if the field is not set or has a value of 0. Optional.
  pageToken: string, A continuation token to resume the query at the next item. Optional.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A response containing the thumbnails in a step.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A continuation token to resume the query at the next item. If set, indicates that there are more thumbnails to read, by calling list again with this value in the page_token field.
  &quot;thumbnails&quot;: [ # A list of image data. Images are returned in a deterministic order; they are ordered by these factors, in order of importance: * First, by their associated test case. Images without a test case are considered greater than images with one. * Second, by their creation time. Images without a creation time are greater than images with one. * Third, by the order in which they were added to the step (by calls to CreateStep or UpdateStep).
    { # An image, with a link to the main image and a thumbnail.
      &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # An error explaining why the thumbnail could not be rendered.
        &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
        &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

            &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
          },
        ],
        &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      },
      &quot;sourceImage&quot;: { # A reference to a ToolExecution output file. # A reference to the full-size, original image. This is the same as the tool_outputs entry for the image under its Step. Always set.
        &quot;creationTime&quot;: { # A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are &quot;smeared&quot; so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear). The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings. # The creation time of the file. - In response: present if set by create/update request - In create/update request: optional
          &quot;nanos&quot;: 42, # Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. Negative second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values that count forward in time. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
          &quot;seconds&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Represents seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Must be from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z inclusive.

        },
        &quot;testCase&quot;: { # A reference to a test case. Test case references are canonically ordered lexicographically by these three factors: * First, by test_suite_name. * Second, by class_name. * Third, by name. # The test case to which this output file belongs. - In response: present if set by create/update request - In create/update request: optional
          &quot;className&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the class.
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the test case. Required.

        &quot;data&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The thumbnail file itself. That is, the bytes here are precisely the bytes that make up the thumbnail file; they can be served as an image as-is (with the appropriate content type.) Always set.
        &quot;heightPx&quot;: 42, # The height of the thumbnail, in pixels. Always set.
