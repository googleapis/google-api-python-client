<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, wipeDataFlags=None, wipeReasonMessage=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a device. This operation wipes the device.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the device in the form enterprises/{enterpriseId}/devices/{deviceId}. (required)
  wipeDataFlags: string, Optional flags that control the device wiping behavior. (repeated)
  wipeReasonMessage: string, Optional. A short message displayed to the user before wiping the work profile on personal devices. This has no effect on company owned devices. The maximum message length is 200 characters.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      # service Foo {
      #   rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      # }
      # The JSON representation for Empty is empty JSON object {}.
