  <pre>Deletes a device. This operation wipes the device. Deleted devices do not show up in enterprises.devices.list calls and a 404 is returned from enterprises.devices.get.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the device in the form enterprises/{enterpriseId}/devices/{deviceId}. (required)
  wipeDataFlags: string, Optional flags that control the device wiping behavior. (repeated)
    Allowed values
      WIPE_DATA_FLAG_UNSPECIFIED - This value is ignored.
      PRESERVE_RESET_PROTECTION_DATA - Preserve the factory reset protection data on the device.
      WIPE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Additionally wipe the device&#x27;s external storage (such as SD cards).
  wipeReasonMessage: string, Optional. A short message displayed to the user before wiping the work profile on personal devices. This has no effect on company owned devices. The maximum message length is 200 characters.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
