<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of HttpsHealthCheck resources available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

Compute Engine Beta API Only: When filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(project, httpsHealthCheck, body)</code>
  <pre>Updates a HttpsHealthCheck resource in the specified project using the data included in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  httpsHealthCheck: string, Name of the HttpsHealthCheck resource to update. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An HttpsHealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how individual instances should be checked for health, via HTTPS.
    "kind": "compute#httpsHealthCheck", # Type of the resource.
    "description": "A String", # An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
    "timeoutSec": 42, # How long (in seconds) to wait before claiming failure. The default value is 5 seconds. It is invalid for timeoutSec to have a greater value than checkIntervalSec.
    "checkIntervalSec": 42, # How often (in seconds) to send a health check. The default value is 5 seconds.
    "port": 42, # The TCP port number for the HTTPS health check request. The default value is 443.
    "healthyThreshold": 42, # A so-far unhealthy instance will be marked healthy after this many consecutive successes. The default value is 2.
    "host": "A String", # The value of the host header in the HTTPS health check request. If left empty (default value), the public IP on behalf of which this health check is performed will be used.
    "requestPath": "A String", # The request path of the HTTPS health check request. The default value is "/".
    "unhealthyThreshold": 42, # A so-far healthy instance will be marked unhealthy after this many consecutive failures. The default value is 2.
    "creationTimestamp": "A String", # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
    "id": "A String", # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
    "selfLink": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    "name": "A String", # Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
  }


Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Operation resource, used to manage asynchronous API requests.
    "targetId": "A String", # [Output Only] The unique target ID, which identifies a specific incarnation of the target resource.
    "clientOperationId": "A String", # [Output Only] Reserved for future use.
