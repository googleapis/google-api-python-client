  <pre>Creates a new shared drive.

Args:
  requestId: string, An ID, such as a random UUID, which uniquely identifies this user&#x27;s request for idempotent creation of a shared drive. A repeated request by the same user and with the same request ID will avoid creating duplicates by attempting to create the same shared drive. If the shared drive already exists a 409 error will be returned. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
