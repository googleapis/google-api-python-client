  <pre>Creates a Snooze that will prevent alerts, which match the provided criteria, from being opened. The Snooze applies for a specific time interval.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3#project_name) in which a Snooze should be created. The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]  (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Snooze will prevent any alerts from being opened, and close any that are already open. The Snooze will work on alerts that match the criteria defined in the Snooze. The Snooze will be active from interval.start_time through interval.end_time.
  &quot;criteria&quot;: { # Criteria specific to the AlertPolicys that this Snooze applies to. The Snooze will suppress alerts that come from one of the AlertPolicys whose names are supplied. # Required. This defines the criteria for applying the Snooze. See Criteria for more information.
    &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The filter string to match on Alert fields when silencing the alerts. It follows the standard https://google.aip.dev/160 syntax. A filter string used to apply the snooze to specific incidents that have matching filter values. Filters can be defined for snoozes that apply to one alerting policy. Filters must be a string formatted as one or more resource labels with specific label values. If multiple resource labels are used, then they must be connected with an AND operator. For example, the following filter applies the snooze to incidents that have an instance ID of 1234567890 and a zone of us-central1-a: resource.labels.instance_id=&quot;1234567890&quot; AND resource.labels.zone=&quot;us-central1-a&quot;
    &quot;policies&quot;: [ # The specific AlertPolicy names for the alert that should be snoozed. The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[POLICY_ID] There is a limit of 16 policies per snooze. This limit is checked during snooze creation. Exactly 1 alert policy is required if filter is specified at the same time.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A display name for the Snooze. This can be, at most, 512 unicode characters.
  &quot;interval&quot;: { # Describes a time interval: Reads: A half-open time interval. It includes the end time but excludes the start time: (startTime, endTime]. The start time must be specified, must be earlier than the end time, and should be no older than the data retention period for the metric. Writes: A closed time interval. It extends from the start time to the end time, and includes both: [startTime, endTime]. Valid time intervals depend on the MetricKind (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors#MetricKind) of the metric value. The end time must not be earlier than the start time, and the end time must not be more than 25 hours in the past or more than five minutes in the future. For GAUGE metrics, the startTime value is technically optional; if no value is specified, the start time defaults to the value of the end time, and the interval represents a single point in time. If both start and end times are specified, they must be identical. Such an interval is valid only for GAUGE metrics, which are point-in-time measurements. The end time of a new interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For DELTA metrics, the start time and end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying contiguous and non-overlapping intervals. For DELTA metrics, the start time of the next interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For CUMULATIVE metrics, the start time and end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying the same start time and increasing end times, until an event resets the cumulative value to zero and sets a new start time for the following points. The new start time must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. The start time of a new interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval because intervals are closed. If the start time of a new interval is the same as the end time of the previous interval, then data written at the new start time could overwrite data written at the previous end time. # Required. The Snooze will be active from interval.start_time through interval.end_time. interval.start_time cannot be in the past. There is a 15 second clock skew to account for the time it takes for a request to reach the API from the UI.
    &quot;endTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The end of the time interval.
    &quot;startTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The beginning of the time interval. The default value for the start time is the end time. The start time must not be later than the end time.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Identifier. The name of the Snooze. The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/snoozes/[SNOOZE_ID] The ID of the Snooze will be generated by the system.

  updateMask: string, Required. The fields to update.For each field listed in update_mask: If the Snooze object supplied in the UpdateSnoozeRequest has a value for that field, the value of the field in the existing Snooze will be set to the value of the field in the supplied Snooze. If the field does not have a value in the supplied Snooze, the field in the existing Snooze is set to its default value.Fields not listed retain their existing value.The following are the field names that are accepted in update_mask: display_name interval.start_time interval.end_timeThat said, the start time and end time of the Snooze determines which fields can legally be updated. Before attempting an update, users should consult the documentation for UpdateSnoozeRequest, which talks about which fields can be updated.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A Snooze will prevent any alerts from being opened, and close any that are already open. The Snooze will work on alerts that match the criteria defined in the Snooze. The Snooze will be active from interval.start_time through interval.end_time.
  &quot;criteria&quot;: { # Criteria specific to the AlertPolicys that this Snooze applies to. The Snooze will suppress alerts that come from one of the AlertPolicys whose names are supplied. # Required. This defines the criteria for applying the Snooze. See Criteria for more information.
    &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The filter string to match on Alert fields when silencing the alerts. It follows the standard https://google.aip.dev/160 syntax. A filter string used to apply the snooze to specific incidents that have matching filter values. Filters can be defined for snoozes that apply to one alerting policy. Filters must be a string formatted as one or more resource labels with specific label values. If multiple resource labels are used, then they must be connected with an AND operator. For example, the following filter applies the snooze to incidents that have an instance ID of 1234567890 and a zone of us-central1-a: resource.labels.instance_id=&quot;1234567890&quot; AND resource.labels.zone=&quot;us-central1-a&quot;
    &quot;policies&quot;: [ # The specific AlertPolicy names for the alert that should be snoozed. The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[POLICY_ID] There is a limit of 16 policies per snooze. This limit is checked during snooze creation. Exactly 1 alert policy is required if filter is specified at the same time.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A display name for the Snooze. This can be, at most, 512 unicode characters.
  &quot;interval&quot;: { # Describes a time interval: Reads: A half-open time interval. It includes the end time but excludes the start time: (startTime, endTime]. The start time must be specified, must be earlier than the end time, and should be no older than the data retention period for the metric. Writes: A closed time interval. It extends from the start time to the end time, and includes both: [startTime, endTime]. Valid time intervals depend on the MetricKind (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors#MetricKind) of the metric value. The end time must not be earlier than the start time, and the end time must not be more than 25 hours in the past or more than five minutes in the future. For GAUGE metrics, the startTime value is technically optional; if no value is specified, the start time defaults to the value of the end time, and the interval represents a single point in time. If both start and end times are specified, they must be identical. Such an interval is valid only for GAUGE metrics, which are point-in-time measurements. The end time of a new interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For DELTA metrics, the start time and end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying contiguous and non-overlapping intervals. For DELTA metrics, the start time of the next interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For CUMULATIVE metrics, the start time and end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying the same start time and increasing end times, until an event resets the cumulative value to zero and sets a new start time for the following points. The new start time must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. The start time of a new interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval because intervals are closed. If the start time of a new interval is the same as the end time of the previous interval, then data written at the new start time could overwrite data written at the previous end time. # Required. The Snooze will be active from interval.start_time through interval.end_time. interval.start_time cannot be in the past. There is a 15 second clock skew to account for the time it takes for a request to reach the API from the UI.
    &quot;endTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The end of the time interval.
    &quot;startTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The beginning of the time interval. The default value for the start time is the end time. The start time must not be later than the end time.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Identifier. The name of the Snooze. The format is: projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/snoozes/[SNOOZE_ID] The ID of the Snooze will be generated by the system.
