Args:
  parent: string, Required. A parent name of the form `projects/{project_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Cloud Firestore Database. Currently only one database is allowed per cloud project; this database must have a `database_id` of &#x27;(default)&#x27;.
  &quot;appEngineIntegrationMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The App Engine integration mode to use for this database.
  &quot;concurrencyMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The concurrency control mode to use for this database.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;keyPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The key_prefix for this database. This key_prefix is used, in combination with the project id (&quot;~&quot;) to construct the application id that is returned from the Cloud Datastore APIs in Google App Engine first generation runtimes. This value may be empty in which case the appid to use for URL-encoded keys is the project_id (eg: foo instead of v~foo).
  &quot;locationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The location of the database. Available databases are listed at https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/locations.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the Database. Format: `projects/{project}/databases/{database}`
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of the database. See https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/firestore-or-datastore for information about how to choose.
}

  databaseId: string, Required. The ID to use for the database, which will become the final component of the database&#x27;s resource name. This value should be 4-63 characters. Valid characters are /a-z-/ with first character a letter and the last a letter or a number. Must not be UUID-like /[0-9a-f]{8}(-[0-9a-f]{4}){3}-[0-9a-f]{12}/. &quot;(default)&quot; database id is also valid.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

Args:
  name: string, Required. A name of the form `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}` (required)
  allowMissing: boolean, If set to true and the Database is not found, the request will succeed but no action will be taken.
  etag: string, The current etag of the Database. If an etag is provided and does not match the current etag of the database, deletion will be blocked and a FAILED_PRECONDITION error will be returned.
  freeId: boolean, If set, will free the database_id associated with this database. uid will be used as the resource id to identify this deleted database.
  validateOnly: boolean, If set, validate the request and preview the response, but do not actually delete the database.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
