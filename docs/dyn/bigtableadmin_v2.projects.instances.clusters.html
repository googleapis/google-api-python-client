  <pre>Creates a cluster within an instance. Note that exactly one of Cluster.serve_nodes and Cluster.cluster_config.cluster_autoscaling_config can be set. If serve_nodes is set to non-zero, then the cluster is manually scaled. If cluster_config.cluster_autoscaling_config is non-empty, then autoscaling is enabled.

  <pre>Updates a cluster within an instance. Note that UpdateCluster does not support updating cluster_config.cluster_autoscaling_config. In order to update it, you must use PartialUpdateCluster.

Args:
  name: string, The unique name of the cluster. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/a-z*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A resizable group of nodes in a particular cloud location, capable of serving all Tables in the parent Instance.
  &quot;clusterConfig&quot;: { # Configuration for a cluster. # Configuration for this cluster.
    &quot;clusterAutoscalingConfig&quot;: { # Autoscaling config for a cluster. # Autoscaling configuration for this cluster.
      &quot;autoscalingLimits&quot;: { # Limits for the number of nodes a Cluster can autoscale up/down to. # Required. Autoscaling limits for this cluster.
        &quot;maxServeNodes&quot;: 42, # Required. Maximum number of nodes to scale up to.
        &quot;minServeNodes&quot;: 42, # Required. Minimum number of nodes to scale down to.
      },
      &quot;autoscalingTargets&quot;: { # The Autoscaling targets for a Cluster. These determine the recommended nodes. # Required. Autoscaling targets for this cluster.
        &quot;cpuUtilizationPercent&quot;: 42, # The cpu utilization that the Autoscaler should be trying to achieve. This number is on a scale from 0 (no utilization) to 100 (total utilization), and is limited between 10 and 80, otherwise it will return INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
        &quot;storageUtilizationGibPerNode&quot;: 42, # The storage utilization that the Autoscaler should be trying to achieve. This number is limited between 2560 (2.5TiB) and 5120 (5TiB) for a SSD cluster and between 8192 (8TiB) and 16384 (16TiB) for an HDD cluster, otherwise it will return INVALID_ARGUMENT error. If this value is set to 0, it will be treated as if it were set to the default value: 2560 for SSD, 8192 for HDD.
      },
    },
  },
  &quot;defaultStorageType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of storage used by this cluster to serve its parent instance&#x27;s tables, unless explicitly overridden.
  &quot;encryptionConfig&quot;: { # Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) settings for a CMEK-protected cluster. # Immutable. The encryption configuration for CMEK-protected clusters.
    &quot;kmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect the destination Bigtable cluster. The requirements for this key are: 1) The Cloud Bigtable service account associated with the project that contains this cluster must be granted the `cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` role on the CMEK key. 2) Only regional keys can be used and the region of the CMEK key must match the region of the cluster. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyring}/cryptoKeys/{key}`
  },
  &quot;location&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The location where this cluster&#x27;s nodes and storage reside. For best performance, clients should be located as close as possible to this cluster. Currently only zones are supported, so values should be of the form `projects/{project}/locations/{zone}`.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique name of the cluster. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/a-z*`.
  &quot;serveNodes&quot;: 42, # The number of nodes allocated to this cluster. More nodes enable higher throughput and more consistent performance.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the cluster.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
