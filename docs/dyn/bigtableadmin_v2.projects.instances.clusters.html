<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, clusterId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a cluster within an instance.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The unique name of the instance in which to create the new cluster. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A resizable group of nodes in a particular cloud location, capable of serving all Tables in the parent Instance.
  &quot;defaultStorageType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of storage used by this cluster to serve its parent instance&#x27;s tables, unless explicitly overridden.
  &quot;encryptionConfig&quot;: { # Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) settings for a CMEK-protected cluster. # Immutable. The encryption configuration for CMEK-protected clusters.
    &quot;kmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect the destination Bigtable cluster. The requirements for this key are: 1) The Cloud Bigtable service account associated with the project that contains this cluster must be granted the `cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` role on the CMEK key. 2) Only regional keys can be used and the region of the CMEK key must match the region of the cluster. 3) All clusters within an instance must use the same CMEK key. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyring}/cryptoKeys/{key}`
  },
  &quot;location&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The location where this cluster&#x27;s nodes and storage reside. For best performance, clients should be located as close as possible to this cluster. Currently only zones are supported, so values should be of the form `projects/{project}/locations/{zone}`.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique name of the cluster. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}/clusters/a-z*`.
  &quot;serveNodes&quot;: 42, # Required. The number of nodes allocated to this cluster. More nodes enable higher throughput and more consistent performance.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the cluster.
}

  clusterId: string, Required. The ID to be used when referring to the new cluster within its instance, e.g., just `mycluster` rather than `projects/myproject/instances/myinstance/clusters/mycluster`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
