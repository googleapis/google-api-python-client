  <pre>Creates an Apigee runtime instance. The instance is accessible from the authorized network configured on the organization. **Note:** Not supported for Apigee hybrid.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the organization. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Apigee runtime instance.
  &quot;consumerAcceptList&quot;: [ # Optional. Customer accept list represents the list of projects (id/number) on customer side that can privately connect to the service attachment. It is an optional field which the customers can provide during the instance creation. By default, the customer project associated with the Apigee organization will be included to the list.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time the instance was created in milliseconds since epoch.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Description of the instance.
  &quot;diskEncryptionKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Customer Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) used for disk and volume encryption. Required for Apigee paid subscriptions only. Use the following format: `projects/([^/]+)/locations/([^/]+)/keyRings/([^/]+)/cryptoKeys/([^/]+)`
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Display name for the instance.
  &quot;host&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Internal hostname or IP address of the Apigee endpoint used by clients to connect to the service.
  &quot;ipRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Comma-separated list of CIDR blocks of length 22 and/or 28 used to create the Apigee instance. Providing CIDR ranges is optional. You can provide just /22 or /28 or both (or neither). Ranges you provide should be freely available as part of a larger named range you have allocated to the Service Networking peering. If this parameter is not provided, Apigee automatically requests an available /22 and /28 CIDR block from Service Networking. Use the /22 CIDR block for configuring your firewall needs to allow traffic from Apigee. Input formats: `a.b.c.d/22` or `e.f.g.h/28` or `a.b.c.d/22,e.f.g.h/28`
  &quot;lastModifiedAt&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time the instance was last modified in milliseconds since epoch.
  &quot;location&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Compute Engine location where the instance resides.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Resource ID of the instance. Values must match the regular expression `^a-z{0,30}[a-z\d]$`.
  &quot;peeringCidrRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Size of the CIDR block range that will be reserved by the instance. PAID organizations support `SLASH_16` to `SLASH_20` and defaults to `SLASH_16`. Evaluation organizations support only `SLASH_23`.
  &quot;port&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Port number of the exposed Apigee endpoint.
  &quot;runtimeVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Version of the runtime system running in the instance. The runtime system is the set of components that serve the API Proxy traffic in your Environments.
  &quot;serviceAttachment&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Resource name of the service attachment created for the instance in the format: `projects/*/regions/*/serviceAttachments/*` Apigee customers can privately forward traffic to this service attachment using the PSC endpoints.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the instance. Values other than `ACTIVE` means the resource is not ready to use.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="reportStatus">reportStatus(instance, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Reports the latest status for a runtime instance.

Args:
  instance: string, The name of the instance reporting this status. For SaaS the request will be rejected if no instance exists under this name. Format is organizations/{org}/instances/{instance} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for ReportInstanceStatus.
  &quot;instanceUid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique ID for the instance which is guaranteed to be unique in case the user installs multiple hybrid runtimes with the same instance ID.
  &quot;reportTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time the report was generated in the runtime. Used to prevent an old status from overwriting a newer one. An instance should space out it&#x27;s status reports so that clock skew does not play a factor.
  &quot;resources&quot;: [ # Status for config resources
    { # The status of a resource loaded in the runtime.
      &quot;resource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name. Currently only two resources are supported: EnvironmentGroup - organizations/{org}/envgroups/{envgroup} EnvironmentConfig - organizations/{org}/environments/{environment}/deployedConfig
      &quot;revisions&quot;: [ # Revisions of the resource currently deployed in the instance.
        { # The status of a specific resource revision.
          &quot;errors&quot;: [ # Errors reported when attempting to load this revision.
            { # Details on why a resource update failed in the runtime.
              &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Status code.
              &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User-friendly error message.
              &quot;resource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The sub resource specific to this error (e.g. a proxy deployed within the EnvironmentConfig). If empty the error refers to the top level resource.
              &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A string that uniquely identifies the type of error. This provides a more reliable means to deduplicate errors across revisions and instances.
            },
          ],
          &quot;jsonSpec&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The json content of the resource revision. Large specs should be sent individually via the spec field to avoid hitting request size limits.
          &quot;replicas&quot;: 42, # The number of replicas that have successfully loaded this revision.
          &quot;revisionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The revision of the resource.
        },
      ],
      &quot;totalReplicas&quot;: 42, # The total number of replicas that should have this resource.
      &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The uid of the resource. In the unexpected case that the instance has multiple uids for the same name, they should be reported under separate ResourceStatuses.
    },
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Placeholder for future enhancements to status reporting protocol
