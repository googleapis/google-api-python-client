  <pre>Gets the current system policy in the specified location.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name, in the format `locations/*/policy`. Note that the system policy is not associated with a project. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A policy for container image binary authorization.
  &quot;admissionWhitelistPatterns&quot;: [ # Optional. Admission policy allowlisting. A matching admission request will always be permitted. This feature is typically used to exclude Google or third-party infrastructure images from Binary Authorization policies.
    { # An admission allowlist pattern exempts images from checks by admission rules.
      &quot;namePattern&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An image name pattern to allowlist, in the form `registry/path/to/image`. This supports a trailing `*` wildcard, but this is allowed only in text after the `registry/` part. This also supports a trailing `**` wildcard which matches subdirectories of a given entry.

  &quot;clusterAdmissionRules&quot;: { # Optional. Per-cluster admission rules. Cluster spec format: `location.clusterId`. There can be at most one admission rule per cluster spec. A `location` is either a compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) or a region (e.g. us-central1). For `clusterId` syntax restrictions see https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters.

Images matching an admission allowlist pattern are exempted from admission rules and will never block a pod creation.
      &quot;enforcementMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The action when a pod creation is denied by the admission rule.
      &quot;evaluationMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. How this admission rule will be evaluated.
      &quot;requireAttestationsBy&quot;: [ # Optional. The resource names of the attestors that must attest to a container image, in the format `projects/*/attestors/*`. Each attestor must exist before a policy can reference it. To add an attestor to a policy the principal issuing the policy change request must be able to read the attestor resource.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A checksum, returned by the server, that can be sent on update requests to ensure the policy has an up-to-date value before attempting to update it. See https://google.aip.dev/154.
  &quot;globalPolicyEvaluationMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Controls the evaluation of a Google-maintained global admission policy for common system-level images. Images not covered by the global policy will be subject to the project admission policy. This setting has no effect when specified inside a global admission policy.
  &quot;istioServiceIdentityAdmissionRules&quot;: { # Optional. Per-istio-service-identity admission rules. Istio service identity spec format: `spiffe:///ns//sa/` or `/ns//sa/` e.g. `spiffe://example.com/ns/test-ns/sa/default`
