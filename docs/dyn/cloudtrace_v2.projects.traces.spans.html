Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the span in the following format: projects/[PROJECT_ID]/traces/[TRACE_ID]/spans/SPAN_ID is a unique identifier for a trace within a project; it is a 32-character hexadecimal encoding of a 16-byte array. [SPAN_ID] is a unique identifier for a span within a trace; it is a 16-character hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array. It should not be zero. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes the end-to-end latency, and one or more subspans for its sub-operations. A trace can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all. Spans do not need to be contiguous—there may be gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.
  &quot;attributes&quot;: { # A set of attributes, each in the format `[KEY]:[VALUE]`. # A set of attributes on the span. You can have up to 32 attributes per span.
    &quot;attributeMap&quot;: { # The set of attributes. Each attribute&#x27;s key can be up to 128 bytes long. The value can be a string up to 256 bytes, a signed 64-bit integer, or the Boolean values `true` and `false`. For example: &quot;/instance_id&quot;: { &quot;string_value&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: &quot;my-instance&quot; } } &quot;/http/request_bytes&quot;: { &quot;int_value&quot;: 300 } &quot;abc.com/myattribute&quot;: { &quot;bool_value&quot;: false }
      &quot;a_key&quot;: { # The allowed types for [VALUE] in a `[KEY]:[VALUE]` attribute.
        &quot;boolValue&quot;: True or False, # A Boolean value represented by `true` or `false`.

          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The shortened string. For example, if the original string is 500 bytes long and the limit of the string is 128 bytes, then `value` contains the first 128 bytes of the 500-byte string. Truncation always happens on a UTF8 character boundary. If there are multi-byte characters in the string, then the length of the shortened string might be less than the size limit.
