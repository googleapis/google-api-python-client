Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the span in the following format:

    projects/[PROJECT_ID]/traces/[TRACE_ID]/spans/SPAN_ID is a unique identifier for a trace within a project;
it is a 32-character hexadecimal encoding of a 16-byte array.

[SPAN_ID] is a unique identifier for a span within a trace; it
is a 16-character hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    # nested to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span
    # that describes the end-to-end latency, and one or more subspans for
    # its sub-operations. A trace can also contain multiple root spans,
    # or none at all. Spans do not need to be contiguous&amp;mdash;there may be
    # gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.
