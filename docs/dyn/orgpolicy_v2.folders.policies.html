<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getEffectivePolicy">getEffectivePolicy(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the effective `Policy` on a resource. This is the result of merging `Policies` in the resource hierarchy and evaluating conditions. The returned `Policy` will not have an `etag` or `condition` set because it is a computed `Policy` across multiple resources. Subtrees of Resource Manager resource hierarchy with &#x27;under:&#x27; prefix will not be expanded.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The effective policy to compute. See `Policy` for naming rules. (required)

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The resource name of the Policy. Must be one of the following forms, where constraint_name is the name of the constraint which this Policy configures: * `projects/{project_number}/policies/{constraint_name}` * `folders/{folder_id}/policies/{constraint_name}` * `organizations/{organization_id}/policies/{constraint_name}` For example, &quot;projects/123/policies/compute.disableSerialPortAccess&quot;. Note: `projects/{project_id}/policies/{constraint_name}` is also an acceptable name for API requests, but responses will return the name using the equivalent project number.
  &quot;spec&quot;: { # Defines a Cloud Organization `PolicySpec` which is used to specify `Constraints` for configurations of Cloud Platform resources. # Basic information about the Organization Policy.
    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An opaque tag indicating the current version of the `Policy`, used for concurrency control. This field is ignored if used in a `CreatePolicy` request. When the `Policy` is returned from either a `GetPolicy` or a `ListPolicies` request, this `etag` indicates the version of the current `Policy` to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset.
    &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`. If `inherit_from_parent` is true, PolicyRules set higher up in the hierarchy (up to the closest root) are inherited and present in the effective policy. If it is false, then no rules are inherited, and this Policy becomes the new root for evaluation. This field can be set only for Policies which configure list constraints.
    &quot;reset&quot;: True or False, # Ignores policies set above this resource and restores the `constraint_default` enforcement behavior of the specific `Constraint` at this resource. This field can be set in policies for either list or boolean constraints. If set, `rules` must be empty and `inherit_from_parent` must be set to false.
    &quot;rules&quot;: [ # Up to 10 PolicyRules are allowed. In Policies for boolean constraints, the following requirements apply: - There must be one and only one PolicyRule where condition is unset. - BooleanPolicyRules with conditions must set `enforced` to the opposite of the PolicyRule without a condition. - During policy evaluation, PolicyRules with conditions that are true for a target resource take precedence.
      { # A rule used to express this policy.
        &quot;allowAll&quot;: True or False, # Setting this to true means that all values are allowed. This field can be set only in Policies for list constraints.
        &quot;condition&quot;: { # Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: &quot;Summary size limit&quot; description: &quot;Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars&quot; expression: &quot;document.summary.size() &lt; 100&quot; Example (Equality): title: &quot;Requestor is owner&quot; description: &quot;Determines if requestor is the document owner&quot; expression: &quot;document.owner == request.auth.claims.email&quot; Example (Logic): title: &quot;Public documents&quot; description: &quot;Determine whether the document should be publicly visible&quot; expression: &quot;document.type != &#x27;private&#x27; &amp;&amp; document.type != &#x27;internal&#x27;&quot; Example (Data Manipulation): title: &quot;Notification string&quot; description: &quot;Create a notification string with a timestamp.&quot; expression: &quot;&#x27;New message received at &#x27; + string(document.create_time)&quot; The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information. # A condition which determines whether this rule is used in the evaluation of the policy. When set, the `expression` field in the `Expr&#x27; must include from 1 to 10 subexpressions, joined by the &quot;||&quot; or &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; operators. Each subexpression must be of the form &quot;resource.matchTag(&#x27;/tag_key_short_name, &#x27;tag_value_short_name&#x27;)&quot;. or &quot;resource.matchTagId(&#x27;tagKeys/key_id&#x27;, &#x27;tagValues/value_id&#x27;)&quot;. where key_name and value_name are the resource names for Label Keys and Values. These names are available from the Tag Manager Service. An example expression is: &quot;resource.matchTag(&#x27;123456789/environment, &#x27;prod&#x27;)&quot;. or &quot;resource.matchTagId(&#x27;tagKeys/123&#x27;, &#x27;tagValues/456&#x27;)&quot;.

          &quot;location&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
          &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.
        },
        &quot;denyAll&quot;: True or False, # Setting this to true means that all values are denied. This field can be set only in Policies for list constraints.
        &quot;enforce&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, then the `Policy` is enforced. If `false`, then any configuration is acceptable. This field can be set only in Policies for boolean constraints.
        &quot;values&quot;: { # A message that holds specific allowed and denied values. This message can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - &quot;projects/&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot; - &quot;folders/&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot; - &quot;organizations/&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot; The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. # List of values to be used for this PolicyRule. This field can be set only in Policies for list constraints.
