Args:
  parent: string, Required. The Google Cloud resource that will parent the new policy. Must be in one of the following forms: * `projects/{project_number}` * `projects/{project_id}` * `folders/{folder_id}` * `organizations/{organization_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  <pre>Deletes a policy. Returns a `google.rpc.Status` with `google.rpc.Code.NOT_FOUND` if the constraint or organization policy does not exist.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the policy to delete. See the policy entry for naming rules. (required)
  etag: string, Optional. The current etag of policy. If an etag is provided and does not match the current etag of the policy, deletion will be blocked and an ABORTED error will be returned.

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getEffectivePolicy">getEffectivePolicy(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the effective policy on a resource. This is the result of merging policies in the resource hierarchy and evaluating conditions. The returned policy will not have an `etag` or `condition` set because it is an evaluated policy across multiple resources. Subtrees of Resource Manager resource hierarchy with &#x27;under:&#x27; prefix will not be expanded.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The effective policy to compute. See Policy for naming requirements. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

This message can define specific values and subtrees of the Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - `projects/` (for example, `projects/tokyo-rain-123`) - `folders/` (for example, `folders/1234`) - `organizations/` (for example, `organizations/1234`) The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. # List of values to be used for this policy rule. This field can be set only in policies for list constraints.

The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison): title: &quot;Summary size limit&quot; description: &quot;Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars&quot; expression: &quot;document.summary.size() &lt; 100&quot; Example (Equality): title: &quot;Requestor is owner&quot; description: &quot;Determines if requestor is the document owner&quot; expression: &quot;document.owner == request.auth.claims.email&quot; Example (Logic): title: &quot;Public documents&quot; description: &quot;Determine whether the document should be publicly visible&quot; expression: &quot;document.type != &#x27;private&#x27; &amp;&amp; document.type != &#x27;internal&#x27;&quot; Example (Data Manipulation): title: &quot;Notification string&quot; description: &quot;Create a notification string with a timestamp.&quot; expression: &quot;&#x27;New message received at &#x27; + string(document.create_time)&quot; The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information. # A condition which determines whether this rule is used in the evaluation of the policy. When set, the `expression` field in the `Expr&#x27; must include from 1 to 10 subexpressions, joined by the &quot;||&quot; or &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; operators. Each subexpression must be of the form &quot;resource.matchTag(&#x27;/tag_key_short_name, &#x27;tag_value_short_name&#x27;)&quot;. or &quot;resource.matchTagId(&#x27;tagKeys/key_id&#x27;, &#x27;tagValues/value_id&#x27;)&quot;. where key_name and value_name are the resource names for Label Keys and Values. These names are available from the Tag Manager Service. An example expression is: &quot;resource.matchTag(&#x27;123456789/environment, &#x27;prod&#x27;)&quot;. or &quot;resource.matchTagId(&#x27;tagKeys/123&#x27;, &#x27;tagValues/456&#x27;)&quot;.
          &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
          &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.
          &quot;location&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
          &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.
        },
        &quot;denyAll&quot;: True or False, # Setting this to true means that all values are denied. This field can be set only in policies for list constraints.
        &quot;enforce&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, then the policy is enforced. If `false`, then any configuration is acceptable. This field can be set only in policies for boolean constraints.
        &quot;parameters&quot;: { # Optional. Required for GMCs if parameters defined in constraints. Pass parameter values when policy enforcement is enabled. Ensure that parameter value types match those defined in the constraint definition. For example: { &quot;allowedLocations&quot; : [&quot;us-east1&quot;, &quot;us-west1&quot;], &quot;allowAll&quot; : true }
          &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object.
        },
        &quot;values&quot;: { # A message that holds specific allowed and denied values. This message can define specific values and subtrees of the Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - `projects/` (for example, `projects/tokyo-rain-123`) - `folders/` (for example, `folders/1234`) - `organizations/` (for example, `organizations/1234`) The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. # List of values to be used for this policy rule. This field can be set only in policies for list constraints.
          &quot;allowedValues&quot;: [ # List of values allowed at this resource.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;deniedValues&quot;: [ # List of values denied at this resource.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
        },
      },
    ],
    &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time stamp this was previously updated. This represents the last time a call to `CreatePolicy` or `UpdatePolicy` was made for that policy.
