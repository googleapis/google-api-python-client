      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

  cutoverJobId: string, Required. The cutover job identifier.
  requestId: string, A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  <pre>Lists the CutoverJobs of a migrating VM. Only 25 most recent CutoverJobs are listed.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent, which owns this collection of migrating VMs. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. The filter request.
  orderBy: string, Optional. the order by fields for the result.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of cutover jobs to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 500 cutover jobs will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.
  pageToken: string, Required. A page token, received from a previous `ListCutoverJobs` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListCutoverJobs` must match the call that provided the page token.
