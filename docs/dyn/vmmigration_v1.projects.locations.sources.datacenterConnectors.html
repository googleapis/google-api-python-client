  <pre>Creates a new DatacenterConnector in a given Source.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The DatacenterConnector&#x27;s parent. Required. The Source in where the new DatacenterConnector will be created. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/sources/my-source` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # DatacenterConnector message describes a connector between the Source and GCP, which is installed on a vmware datacenter (an OVA vm installed by the user) to connect the Datacenter to GCP and support vm migration data transfer.
  &quot;bucket&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The communication channel between the datacenter connector and GCP.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the connector was created (as an API call, not when it was actually installed).
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Output only. Provides details on the state of the Datacenter Connector in case of an error.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The connector&#x27;s name.
  &quot;registrationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. A unique key for this connector. This key is internal to the OVA connector and is supplied with its creation during the registration process and can not be modified.
  &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The service account to use in the connector when communicating with the cloud.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the DatacenterConnector, as determined by the health checks.
  &quot;stateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the state was last set.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last time the connector was updated with an API call.
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The version running in the DatacenterConnector. This is supplied by the OVA connector during the registration process and can not be modified.
}

  datacenterConnectorId: string, Required. The datacenterConnector identifier.
  requestId: string, A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name.
