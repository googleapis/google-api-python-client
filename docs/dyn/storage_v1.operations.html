<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="cancel">cancel(bucket, operationId)</code>
  <pre>Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed.

Args:
  bucket: string, The parent bucket of the operation resource. (required)
  operationId: string, The ID of the operation resource. (required)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="close">close()</code>
  <pre>Close httplib2 connections.</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(bucket, operationId)</code>
  <pre>Gets the latest state of a long-running operation.

Args:
  bucket: string, The parent bucket of the operation resource. (required)
  operationId: string, The ID of the operation resource. (required)

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is &quot;false&quot;, it means the operation is still in progress. If &quot;true&quot;, the operation is completed, and either &quot;error&quot; or &quot;response&quot; is available.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(bucket, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request.

Args:
  bucket: string, Name of the bucket in which to look for operations. (required)
  filter: string, A filter to narrow down results to a preferred subset. The filtering language is documented in more detail in [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160).
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of items to return in a single page of responses. Fewer total results may be returned than requested. The service uses this parameter or 100 items, whichever is smaller.
  pageToken: string, A previously-returned page token representing part of the larger set of results to view.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response message for storage.buckets.operations.list.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
