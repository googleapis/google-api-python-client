Operation &lt;response: google.protobuf.Empty&gt;

Args:

`projects/&lt;Project ID&gt;/agent`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for Intents.BatchDeleteIntents.
    &quot;intents&quot;: [ # Required. The collection of intents to delete. Only intent `name` must be
        # filled in.
      { # Represents an intent.
          # Intents convert a number of user expressions or patterns into an action. An
          # action is an extraction of a user command or sentence semantics.
        &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of this intent.
        &quot;rootFollowupIntentName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of the root intent in the chain of
            # followup intents. It identifies the correct followup intents chain for
            # this intent.
            #
            # Format: `projects/&lt;Project ID&gt;/agent/intents/&lt;Intent ID&gt;`.
        &quot;mlDisabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether Machine Learning is disabled for the intent.
            # Note: If `ml_disabled` setting is set to true, then this intent is not
            # taken into account during inference in `ML ONLY` match mode. Also,
            # auto-markup in the UI is turned off.
        &quot;isFallback&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether this is a fallback intent.
        &quot;mlEnabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether Machine Learning is enabled for the intent.

            # taken into account during inference in `ML ONLY` match mode. Also,
            # auto-markup in the UI is turned off.
            # DEPRECATED! Please use `ml_disabled` field instead.
            # NOTE: If both `ml_enabled` and `ml_disabled` are either not set or false,
            # then the default value is determined as follows:
            # - Before April 15th, 2018 the default is:
            #   ml_enabled = false / ml_disabled = true.

                # If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters,
                # you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set.
                #
                # If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple
                # parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways:
