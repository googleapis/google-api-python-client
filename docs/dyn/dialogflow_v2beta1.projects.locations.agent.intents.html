  &quot;intents&quot;: [ # Required. The collection of intents to delete. Only intent `name` must be filled in.
    { # An intent categorizes an end-user&#x27;s intention for one conversation turn. For each agent, you define many intents, where your combined intents can handle a complete conversation. When an end-user writes or says something, referred to as an end-user expression or end-user input, Dialogflow matches the end-user input to the best intent in your agent. Matching an intent is also known as intent classification. For more information, see the [intent guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/intents-overview).
      &quot;action&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the action associated with the intent. Note: The action name must not contain whitespaces.

        { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
          &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.

If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow.

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

  <pre>Updates/Creates multiple intents in the specified agent. This method is a [long-running operation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/how/long-running-operations). The returned `Operation` type has the following method-specific fields: - `metadata`: An empty [Struct message](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#struct) - `response`: BatchUpdateIntentsResponse Note: You should always train an agent prior to sending it queries. See the [training documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/training).

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the agent to update or create intents in. Supported formats: - `projects//agent` - `projects//locations//agent` (required)

If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
            &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.

If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow.

If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`, and `user_defined` fields are all set.

    { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
      &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.

Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`, and `user_defined` fields are all set.

Setting the `lifespan_count` to 0 will reset the context when the intent is matched. Format: `projects//agent/sessions/-/contexts/`.
    { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
      &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.

Supported formats: - `projects//agent/sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//locations//agent/sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//locations//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`, The `Context ID` is always converted to lowercase, may only contain characters in a-zA-Z0-9_-% and may be at most 250 bytes long. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow. You should not use these contexts or create contexts with these names: * `__system_counters__` * `*_id_dialog_context` * `*_dialog_params_size`
      &quot;parameters&quot;: { # Optional. The collection of parameters associated with this context.

  &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Optional. The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities. - If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the `Normal` priority in the console. - If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.

Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`, and `user_defined` fields are all set.
        { # Represents a part of a training phrase.

    { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
      &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.

If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user.

        { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
          &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.

If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow.

Setting the `lifespan_count` to 0 will reset the context when the intent is matched. Format: `projects//agent/sessions/-/contexts/`.
    { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
      &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.

Supported formats: - `projects//agent/sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//locations//agent/sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//locations//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`, The `Context ID` is always converted to lowercase, may only contain characters in a-zA-Z0-9_-% and may be at most 250 bytes long. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow. You should not use these contexts or create contexts with these names: * `__system_counters__` * `*_id_dialog_context` * `*_dialog_params_size`
      &quot;parameters&quot;: { # Optional. The collection of parameters associated with this context.

Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`, and `user_defined` fields are all set.

    },
  ],
  &quot;mlDisabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether Machine Learning is disabled for the intent. Note: If `ml_disabled` setting is set to true, then this intent is not taken into account during inference in `ML ONLY` match mode. Also, auto-markup in the UI is turned off.
  &quot;mlEnabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether Machine Learning is enabled for the intent. Note: If `ml_enabled` setting is set to false, then this intent is not taken into account during inference in `ML ONLY` match mode. Also, auto-markup in the UI is turned off. DEPRECATED! Please use `ml_disabled` field instead. NOTE: If both `ml_enabled` and `ml_disabled` are either not set or false, then the default value is determined as follows: - Before April 15th, 2018 the default is: ml_enabled = false / ml_disabled = true. - After April 15th, 2018 the default is: ml_enabled = true / ml_disabled = false.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The unique identifier of this intent. Required for Intents.UpdateIntent and Intents.BatchUpdateIntents methods. Supported formats: - `projects//agent/intents/` - `projects//locations//agent/intents/`
  &quot;outputContexts&quot;: [ # Optional. The collection of contexts that are activated when the intent is matched. Context messages in this collection should not set the parameters field. Setting the `lifespan_count` to 0 will reset the context when the intent is matched. Format: `projects//agent/sessions/-/contexts/`.
    { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
      &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The unique identifier of the context. Supported formats: - `projects//agent/sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//locations//agent/sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//locations//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`, The `Context ID` is always converted to lowercase, may only contain characters in a-zA-Z0-9_-% and may be at most 250 bytes long. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow. You should not use these contexts or create contexts with these names: * `__system_counters__` * `*_id_dialog_context` * `*_dialog_params_size`
      &quot;parameters&quot;: { # Optional. The collection of parameters associated with this context. Depending on your protocol or client library language, this is a map, associative array, symbol table, dictionary, or JSON object composed of a collection of (MapKey, MapValue) pairs: - MapKey type: string - MapKey value: parameter name - MapValue type: - If parameter&#x27;s entity type is a composite entity: map - Else: depending on parameter value type, could be one of string, number, boolean, null, list or map - MapValue value: - If parameter&#x27;s entity type is a composite entity: map from composite entity property names to property values - Else: parameter value
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object.
      },
    },
  ],
  &quot;parameters&quot;: [ # Optional. The collection of parameters associated with the intent.
    { # Represents intent parameters.
      &quot;defaultValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The default value to use when the `value` yields an empty result. Default values can be extracted from contexts by using the following syntax: `#context_name.parameter_name`.
      &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the parameter.
      &quot;entityTypeDisplayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the entity type, prefixed with `@`, that describes values of the parameter. If the parameter is required, this must be provided.
      &quot;isList&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether the parameter represents a list of values.
      &quot;mandatory&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether the parameter is required. That is, whether the intent cannot be completed without collecting the parameter value.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique identifier of this parameter.
      &quot;prompts&quot;: [ # Optional. The collection of prompts that the agent can present to the user in order to collect a value for the parameter.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The definition of the parameter value. It can be: - a constant string, - a parameter value defined as `$parameter_name`, - an original parameter value defined as `$parameter_name.original`, - a parameter value from some context defined as `#context_name.parameter_name`.
    },
  ],
  &quot;parentFollowupIntentName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The unique identifier of the parent intent in the chain of followup intents. You can set this field when creating an intent, for example with CreateIntent or BatchUpdateIntents, in order to make this intent a followup intent. It identifies the parent followup intent. Format: `projects//agent/intents/`.
  &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Optional. The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities. - If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the `Normal` priority in the console. - If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.
  &quot;resetContexts&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether to delete all contexts in the current session when this intent is matched.
  &quot;rootFollowupIntentName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of the root intent in the chain of followup intents. It identifies the correct followup intents chain for this intent. Format: `projects//agent/intents/`.
  &quot;trainingPhrases&quot;: [ # Optional. The collection of examples that the agent is trained on.
    { # Represents an example that the agent is trained on.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of this training phrase.
      &quot;parts&quot;: [ # Required. The ordered list of training phrase parts. The parts are concatenated in order to form the training phrase. Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`, and `user_defined` fields are all set.
        { # Represents a part of a training phrase.
          &quot;alias&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The parameter name for the value extracted from the annotated part of the example. This field is required for annotated parts of the training phrase.
          &quot;entityType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The entity type name prefixed with `@`. This field is required for annotated parts of the training phrase.
          &quot;text&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The text for this part.
          &quot;userDefined&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether the text was manually annotated. This field is set to true when the Dialogflow Console is used to manually annotate the part. When creating an annotated part with the API, you must set this to true.
        },
      ],
      &quot;timesAddedCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. Indicates how many times this example was added to the intent. Each time a developer adds an existing sample by editing an intent or training, this counter is increased.
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The type of the training phrase.
    },
  ],
  &quot;webhookState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Indicates whether webhooks are enabled for the intent.
