    <code class="details" id="create">create(appsId, body=None, overrideStrategy=None, noManagedCertificate=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Maps a domain to an application. A user must be authorized to administer a domain in order to map it to an application. For a list of available authorized domains, see AuthorizedDomains.ListAuthorizedDomains.

Args:
  appsId: string, Part of `parent`. Name of the parent Application resource. Example: apps/myapp. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A domain serving an App Engine application.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Full path to the DomainMapping resource in the API. Example: apps/myapp/domainMapping/example.com.@OutputOnly
  &quot;sslSettings&quot;: { # SSL configuration for a DomainMapping resource. # SSL configuration for this domain. If unconfigured, this domain will not serve with SSL.
    &quot;isManagedCertificate&quot;: True or False, # Whether the mapped certificate is an App Engine managed certificate. Managed certificates are created by default with a domain mapping. To opt out, specify no_managed_certificate on a CREATE or UPDATE request.@OutputOnly
    &quot;certificateId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # ID of the AuthorizedCertificate resource configuring SSL for the application. Clearing this field will remove SSL support.By default, a managed certificate is automatically created for every domain mapping. To omit SSL support or to configure SSL manually, specify no_managed_certificate on a CREATE or UPDATE request. You must be authorized to administer the AuthorizedCertificate resource to manually map it to a DomainMapping resource. Example: 12345.
  },
