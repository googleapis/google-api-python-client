<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="abandonInstances">abandonInstances(project, zone, instanceGroupManager, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Flags the specified instances to be removed from the managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the status of the abandoning action with the listmanagedinstances method.

If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, The name of the managed instance group. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "instances": [ # The URLs of one or more instances to abandon. This can be a full URL or a partial URL, such as zones/[ZONE]/instances/[INSTANCE_NAME].
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of managed instance groups and groups them by zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

              "key": "A String", # [Output Only] A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned. For example, for warnings where there are no results in a list request for a particular zone, this key might be scope and the key value might be the zone name. Other examples might be a key indicating a deprecated resource and a suggested replacement, or a warning about invalid network settings (for example, if an instance attempts to perform IP forwarding but is not enabled for IP forwarding).

  <pre>Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are created using the specified instance template. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listmanagedinstances method.

A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group. Please contact Cloud Support if you need an increase in this limit.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where you want to create the managed instance group. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a Managed Instance Group resource.

      # For regional Managed Instance Group, use the regionInstanceGroupManagers resource. (== resource_for beta.instanceGroupManagers ==) (== resource_for v1.instanceGroupManagers ==) (== resource_for beta.regionInstanceGroupManagers ==) (== resource_for v1.regionInstanceGroupManagers ==)
    "status": { # [Output Only] The status of this managed instance group.
      "isStable": True or False, # [Output Only] A bit indicating whether the managed instance group is in a stable state. A stable state means that: none of the instances in the managed instance group is currently undergoing any type of change (for example, creation, restart, or deletion); no future changes are scheduled for instances in the managed instance group; and the managed instance group itself is not being modified.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of managed instance groups that are contained within the specified project and zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # [Output Only] A list of managed instance groups.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

When resizing down, the instance group arbitrarily chooses the order in which VMs are deleted. The group takes into account some VM attributes when making the selection including:

+ The status of the VM instance. + The health of the VM instance. + The instance template version the VM is based on. + For regional managed instance groups, the location of the VM instance.

This list is subject to change.

If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, The name of the managed instance group. (required)
  size: integer, The number of running instances that the managed instance group should maintain at any given time. The group automatically adds or removes instances to maintain the number of instances specified by this parameter. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
