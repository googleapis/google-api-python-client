<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body, parent=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a Folder in the resource hierarchy.
Returns an Operation which can be used to track the progress of the
folder creation workflow.
Upon success the Operation.response field will be populated with the
created Folder.

In order to succeed, the addition of this new Folder must not violate
the Folder naming, height or fanout constraints.

+ The Folder's display_name must be distinct from all other Folder's that
share its parent.
+ The addition of the Folder must not cause the active Folder hierarchy
to exceed a height of 4. Note, the full active + deleted Folder hierarchy
is allowed to reach a height of 8; this provides additional headroom when
moving folders that contain deleted folders.
+ The addition of the Folder must not cause the total number of Folders
under its parent to exceed 100.

If the operation fails due to a folder constraint violation, some errors
may be returned by the CreateFolder request, with status code
FAILED_PRECONDITION and an error description. Other folder constraint
violations will be communicated in the Operation, with the specific
PreconditionFailure returned via the details list in the Operation.error
field.

The caller must have `resourcemanager.folders.create` permission on the
identified parent.

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

      # no two folders with the same parent can share the same display name.
      # The display name must start and end with a letter or digit, may contain
      # letters, digits, spaces, hyphens and underscores and can be no longer
      # than 30 characters. This is captured by the regular expression:
