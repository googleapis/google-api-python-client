  <pre>Imports a list of externally generated EvaluatedAnnotations.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the parent ModelEvaluationSlice resource. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/models/{model}/evaluations/{evaluation}/slices/{slice}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for ModelService.BatchImportEvaluatedAnnotations
  &quot;evaluatedAnnotations&quot;: [ # Required. Evaluated annotations resource to be imported.
    { # True positive, false positive, or false negative. EvaluatedAnnotation is only available under ModelEvaluationSlice with slice of `annotationSpec` dimension.
      &quot;dataItemPayload&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Output only. The data item payload that the Model predicted this EvaluatedAnnotation on.
      &quot;errorAnalysisAnnotations&quot;: [ # Annotations of model error analysis results.
        { # Model error analysis for each annotation.
          &quot;attributedItems&quot;: [ # Attributed items for a given annotation, typically representing neighbors from the training sets constrained by the query type.
            { # Attributed items for a given annotation, typically representing neighbors from the training sets constrained by the query type.
              &quot;annotationResourceName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique ID for each annotation. Used by FE to allocate the annotation in DB.
              &quot;distance&quot;: 3.14, # The distance of this item to the annotation.
            },
          ],
          &quot;outlierScore&quot;: 3.14, # The outlier score of this annotated item. Usually defined as the min of all distances from attributed items.
          &quot;outlierThreshold&quot;: 3.14, # The threshold used to determine if this annotation is an outlier or not.
          &quot;queryType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The query type used for finding the attributed items.
        },
      ],
      &quot;evaluatedDataItemViewId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. ID of the EvaluatedDataItemView under the same ancestor ModelEvaluation. The EvaluatedDataItemView consists of all ground truths and predictions on data_item_payload.
      &quot;explanations&quot;: [ # Explanations of predictions. Each element of the explanations indicates the explanation for one explanation Method. The attributions list in the EvaluatedAnnotationExplanation.explanation object corresponds to the predictions list. For example, the second element in the attributions list explains the second element in the predictions list.
        { # Explanation result of the prediction produced by the Model.
          &quot;explanation&quot;: { # Explanation of a prediction (provided in PredictResponse.predictions) produced by the Model on a given instance. # Explanation attribution response details.
            &quot;attributions&quot;: [ # Output only. Feature attributions grouped by predicted outputs. For Models that predict only one output, such as regression Models that predict only one score, there is only one attibution that explains the predicted output. For Models that predict multiple outputs, such as multiclass Models that predict multiple classes, each element explains one specific item. Attribution.output_index can be used to identify which output this attribution is explaining. By default, we provide Shapley values for the predicted class. However, you can configure the explanation request to generate Shapley values for any other classes too. For example, if a model predicts a probability of `0.4` for approving a loan application, the model&#x27;s decision is to reject the application since `p(reject) = 0.6 &gt; p(approve) = 0.4`, and the default Shapley values would be computed for rejection decision and not approval, even though the latter might be the positive class. If users set ExplanationParameters.top_k, the attributions are sorted by instance_output_value in descending order. If ExplanationParameters.output_indices is specified, the attributions are stored by Attribution.output_index in the same order as they appear in the output_indices.
              { # Attribution that explains a particular prediction output.
                &quot;approximationError&quot;: 3.14, # Output only. Error of feature_attributions caused by approximation used in the explanation method. Lower value means more precise attributions. * For Sampled Shapley attribution, increasing path_count might reduce the error. * For Integrated Gradients attribution, increasing step_count might reduce the error. * For XRAI attribution, increasing step_count might reduce the error. See [this introduction](/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview) for more information.
                &quot;baselineOutputValue&quot;: 3.14, # Output only. Model predicted output if the input instance is constructed from the baselines of all the features defined in ExplanationMetadata.inputs. The field name of the output is determined by the key in ExplanationMetadata.outputs. If the Model&#x27;s predicted output has multiple dimensions (rank &gt; 1), this is the value in the output located by output_index. If there are multiple baselines, their output values are averaged.
                &quot;featureAttributions&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Output only. Attributions of each explained feature. Features are extracted from the prediction instances according to explanation metadata for inputs. The value is a struct, whose keys are the name of the feature. The values are how much the feature in the instance contributed to the predicted result. The format of the value is determined by the feature&#x27;s input format: * If the feature is a scalar value, the attribution value is a floating number. * If the feature is an array of scalar values, the attribution value is an array. * If the feature is a struct, the attribution value is a struct. The keys in the attribution value struct are the same as the keys in the feature struct. The formats of the values in the attribution struct are determined by the formats of the values in the feature struct. The ExplanationMetadata.feature_attributions_schema_uri field, pointed to by the ExplanationSpec field of the Endpoint.deployed_models object, points to the schema file that describes the features and their attribution values (if it is populated).

For example, the predicted class name by a multi-classification Model. This field is only populated iff the Model predicts display names as a separate field along with the explained output. The predicted display name must has the same shape of the explained output, and can be located using output_index.
                &quot;outputIndex&quot;: [ # Output only. The index that locates the explained prediction output. If the prediction output is a scalar value, output_index is not populated. If the prediction output has multiple dimensions, the length of the output_index list is the same as the number of dimensions of the output. The i-th element in output_index is the element index of the i-th dimension of the output vector. Indices start from 0.

The field name of the output is determined by the key in ExplanationMetadata.outputs. If the Model predicted output has multiple dimensions, this is the value in the output located by output_index.
            &quot;outputDisplayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The display name of the output identified by output_index. For example, the predicted class name by a multi-classification Model. This field is only populated iff the Model predicts display names as a separate field along with the explained output. The predicted display name must has the same shape of the explained output, and can be located using output_index.
            &quot;outputIndex&quot;: [ # Output only. The index that locates the explained prediction output. If the prediction output is a scalar value, output_index is not populated. If the prediction output has multiple dimensions, the length of the output_index list is the same as the number of dimensions of the output. The i-th element in output_index is the element index of the i-th dimension of the output vector. Indices start from 0.

      &quot;slice&quot;: { # Definition of a slice. # Output only. The slice of the test data that is used to evaluate the Model.
        &quot;dimension&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The dimension of the slice. Well-known dimensions are: * `annotationSpec`: This slice is on the test data that has either ground truth or prediction with AnnotationSpec.display_name equals to value. * `slice`: This slice is a user customized slice defined by its SliceSpec.
        &quot;sliceSpec&quot;: { # Specification for how the data should be sliced. # Output only. Specification for how the data was sliced.
          &quot;configs&quot;: { # Mapping configuration for this SliceSpec. The key is the name of the feature. By default, the key will be prefixed by &quot;instance&quot; as a dictionary prefix for Vertex Batch Predictions output format.

When `all_values` is present, a separate slice will be computed for each possible label/value for the corresponding key in `config`. Examples, with feature zip_code with values 12345, 23334, 88888 and feature country with values &quot;US&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot; in the dataset: Example 1: { &quot;zip_code&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;float_value&quot;: 12345.0 } } } A single slice for any data with zip_code 12345 in the dataset. Example 2: { &quot;zip_code&quot;: { &quot;range&quot;: { &quot;low&quot;: 12345, &quot;high&quot;: 20000 } } } A single slice containing data where the zip_codes between 12345 and 20000 For this example, data with the zip_code of 12345 will be in this slice. Example 3: { &quot;zip_code&quot;: { &quot;range&quot;: { &quot;low&quot;: 10000, &quot;high&quot;: 20000 } }, &quot;country&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;string_value&quot;: &quot;US&quot; } } } A single slice containing data where the zip_codes between 10000 and 20000 has the country &quot;US&quot;. For this example, data with the zip_code of 12345 and country &quot;US&quot; will be in this slice. Example 4: { &quot;country&quot;: {&quot;all_values&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: true } } } Three slices are computed, one for each unique country in the dataset. Example 5: { &quot;country&quot;: { &quot;all_values&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: true } }, &quot;zip_code&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;float_value&quot;: 12345.0 } } } Three slices are computed, one for each unique country in the dataset where the zip_code is also 12345. For this example, data with zip_code 12345 and country &quot;US&quot; will be in one slice, zip_code 12345 and country &quot;Canada&quot; in another slice, and zip_code 12345 and country &quot;Mexico&quot; in another slice, totaling 3 slices.
              &quot;allValues&quot;: True or False, # If all_values is set to true, then all possible labels of the keyed feature will have another slice computed. Example: `{&quot;all_values&quot;:{&quot;value&quot;:true}}`

                &quot;high&quot;: 3.14, # Exclusive high value for the range.
                &quot;low&quot;: 3.14, # Inclusive low value for the range.
