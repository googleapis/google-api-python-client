It is heavily based on the GoogleSQL standard to help maintain familiarity and consistency across products and features. For compatibility with Bigtable&#x27;s existing untyped APIs, each `Type` includes an `Encoding` which describes how to convert to/from the underlying data. Each encoding also defines the following properties: * Order-preserving: Does the encoded value sort consistently with the original typed value? Note that Bigtable will always sort data based on the raw encoded value, *not* the decoded type. - Example: BYTES values sort in the same order as their raw encodings. - Counterexample: Encoding INT64 as a fixed-width decimal string does *not* preserve sort order when dealing with negative numbers. INT64(1) &gt; INT64(-1), but STRING(&quot;-00001&quot;) &gt; STRING(&quot;00001). * Self-delimiting: If we concatenate two encoded values, can we always tell where the first one ends and the second one begins? - Example: If we encode INT64s to fixed-width STRINGs, the first value will always contain exactly N digits, possibly preceded by a sign. - Counterexample: If we concatenate two UTF-8 encoded STRINGs, we have no way to tell where the first one ends. * Compatibility: Which other systems have matching encoding schemes? For example, does this encoding have a GoogleSQL equivalent? HBase? Java? # The type of data stored in each of this family&#x27;s cell values, including its full encoding. If omitted, the family only serves raw untyped bytes. For now, only the `Aggregate` type is supported. `Aggregate` can only be set at family creation and is immutable afterwards.

Each encoding also defines the following properties: * Order-preserving: Does the encoded value sort consistently with the original typed value? Note that Bigtable will always sort data based on the raw encoded value, *not* the decoded type. - Example: BYTES values sort in the same order as their raw encodings. - Counterexample: Encoding INT64 as a fixed-width decimal string does *not* preserve sort order when dealing with negative numbers. INT64(1) &gt; INT64(-1), but STRING(&quot;-00001&quot;) &gt; STRING(&quot;00001). * Self-delimiting: If we concatenate two encoded values, can we always tell where the first one ends and the second one begins? - Example: If we encode INT64s to fixed-width STRINGs, the first value will always contain exactly N digits, possibly preceded by a sign. - Counterexample: If we concatenate two UTF-8 encoded STRINGs, we have no way to tell where the first one ends. * Compatibility: Which other systems have matching encoding schemes? For example, does this encoding have a GoogleSQL equivalent? HBase? Java? # The type of data stored in each of this family&#x27;s cell values, including its full encoding. If omitted, the family only serves raw untyped bytes. For now, only the `Aggregate` type is supported. `Aggregate` can only be set at family creation and is immutable afterwards.

It is heavily based on the GoogleSQL standard to help maintain familiarity and consistency across products and features. For compatibility with Bigtable&#x27;s existing untyped APIs, each `Type` includes an `Encoding` which describes how to convert to/from the underlying data. Each encoding also defines the following properties: * Order-preserving: Does the encoded value sort consistently with the original typed value? Note that Bigtable will always sort data based on the raw encoded value, *not* the decoded type. - Example: BYTES values sort in the same order as their raw encodings. - Counterexample: Encoding INT64 as a fixed-width decimal string does *not* preserve sort order when dealing with negative numbers. INT64(1) &gt; INT64(-1), but STRING(&quot;-00001&quot;) &gt; STRING(&quot;00001). * Self-delimiting: If we concatenate two encoded values, can we always tell where the first one ends and the second one begins? - Example: If we encode INT64s to fixed-width STRINGs, the first value will always contain exactly N digits, possibly preceded by a sign. - Counterexample: If we concatenate two UTF-8 encoded STRINGs, we have no way to tell where the first one ends. * Compatibility: Which other systems have matching encoding schemes? For example, does this encoding have a GoogleSQL equivalent? HBase? Java? # The type of data stored in each of this family&#x27;s cell values, including its full encoding. If omitted, the family only serves raw untyped bytes. For now, only the `Aggregate` type is supported. `Aggregate` can only be set at family creation and is immutable afterwards.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

Each encoding also defines the following properties: * Order-preserving: Does the encoded value sort consistently with the original typed value? Note that Bigtable will always sort data based on the raw encoded value, *not* the decoded type. - Example: BYTES values sort in the same order as their raw encodings. - Counterexample: Encoding INT64 as a fixed-width decimal string does *not* preserve sort order when dealing with negative numbers. INT64(1) &gt; INT64(-1), but STRING(&quot;-00001&quot;) &gt; STRING(&quot;00001). * Self-delimiting: If we concatenate two encoded values, can we always tell where the first one ends and the second one begins? - Example: If we encode INT64s to fixed-width STRINGs, the first value will always contain exactly N digits, possibly preceded by a sign. - Counterexample: If we concatenate two UTF-8 encoded STRINGs, we have no way to tell where the first one ends. * Compatibility: Which other systems have matching encoding schemes?

If omitted, the family only serves raw untyped bytes. For now, only the `Aggregate` type is supported. `Aggregate` can only be set at family creation and is immutable afterwards.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
