    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
      # request, the resource, or both.

        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy

        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #

        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all tables served from a specified instance.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The unique name of the instance for which tables should be listed.
Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}`. (required)
  pageToken: string, The value of `next_page_token` returned by a previous call.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum number of results per page.

A page_size of zero lets the server choose the number of items to return.
A page_size which is strictly positive will return at most that many items.
A negative page_size will cause an error.

Following the first request, subsequent paginated calls are not required
to pass a page_size. If a page_size is set in subsequent calls, it must
match the page_size given in the first request.
  view: string, The view to be applied to the returned tables&#x27; fields.
Only NAME_ONLY view (default) and REPLICATION_VIEW are supported.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
