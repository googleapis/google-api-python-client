Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A workstation configuration resource in the Cloud Workstations API. Workstation configurations act as templates for workstations. The workstation configuration defines details such as the workstation virtual machine (VM) instance type, persistent storage, container image defining environment, which IDE or Code Editor to use, and more. Administrators and platform teams can also use [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) rules to grant access to teams or to individual developers.
  &quot;allowedPorts&quot;: [ # Optional. A list of PortRanges specifying single ports or ranges of ports that are externally accessible in the workstation. Allowed ports must be one of 22, 80, or within range 1024-65535. If not specified defaults to ports 22, 80, and ports 1024-65535.

We recommend that you use a separate service account and follow [Cloud KMS best practices](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/separation-of-duties). # Immutable. Encrypts resources of this workstation configuration using a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK). If specified, the boot disk of the Compute Engine instance and the persistent disk are encrypted using this encryption key. If this field is not set, the disks are encrypted using a generated key. Customer-managed encryption keys do not protect disk metadata. If the customer-managed encryption key is rotated, when the workstation instance is stopped, the system attempts to recreate the persistent disk with the new version of the key. Be sure to keep older versions of the key until the persistent disk is recreated. Otherwise, data on the persistent disk might be lost. If the encryption key is revoked, the workstation session automatically stops within 7 hours. Immutable after the workstation configuration is created.
    &quot;kmsKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The name of the Google Cloud KMS encryption key. For example, `&quot;projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION/keyRings/KEY_RING/cryptoKeys/KEY_NAME&quot;`. The key must be in the same region as the workstation configuration.
    &quot;kmsKeyServiceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The service account to use with the specified KMS key. We recommend that you use a separate service account and follow KMS best practices. For more information, see [Separation of duties](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/separation-of-duties) and `gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding` [`--member`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/kms/keys/add-iam-policy-binding#--member).

        &quot;sourceImage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Name of the disk image to use as the source for the disk. Must be empty if source_snapshot is set. Updating source_image will update content in the ephemeral directory after the workstation is restarted. This field is mutable.
        &quot;sourceSnapshot&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Name of the snapshot to use as the source for the disk. Must be empty if source_image is set. Must be empty if read_only is false. Updating source_snapshot will update content in the ephemeral directory after the workstation is restarted. This field is mutable.
      },

        &quot;enableConfidentialCompute&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether the instance has confidential compute enabled.
      },
      &quot;disablePublicIpAddresses&quot;: True or False, # Optional. When set to true, disables public IP addresses for VMs. If you disable public IP addresses, you must set up Private Google Access or Cloud NAT on your network. If you use Private Google Access and you use `private.googleapis.com` or `restricted.googleapis.com` for Container Registry and Artifact Registry, make sure that you set up DNS records for domains `*.gcr.io` and `*.pkg.dev`. Defaults to false (VMs have public IP addresses).
      &quot;disableSsh&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether to disable SSH access to the VM.
      &quot;enableNestedVirtualization&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Whether to enable nested virtualization on Cloud Workstations VMs created using this workstation configuration. Defaults to false. Nested virtualization lets you run virtual machine (VM) instances inside your workstation. Before enabling nested virtualization, consider the following important considerations. Cloud Workstations instances are subject to the [same restrictions as Compute Engine instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/overview#restrictions): * **Organization policy**: projects, folders, or organizations may be restricted from creating nested VMs if the **Disable VM nested virtualization** constraint is enforced in the organization policy. For more information, see the Compute Engine section, [Checking whether nested virtualization is allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/managing-constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed). * **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater decrease in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and possibly greater than a 10% decrease for workloads that are input/output bound. * **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can only be enabled on workstation configurations that specify a machine_type in the N1 or N2 machine series.
      &quot;machineType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The type of machine to use for VM instances—for example, `&quot;e2-standard-4&quot;`.

      &quot;poolSize&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of VMs that the system should keep idle so that new workstations can be started quickly for new users. Defaults to `0` in the API.
      &quot;pooledInstances&quot;: 42, # Output only. Number of instances currently available in the pool for faster workstation startup.
      &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The email address of the service account for Cloud Workstations VMs created with this configuration. When specified, be sure that the service account has `logging.logEntries.create` and `monitoring.timeSeries.create` permissions on the project so it can write logs out to Cloud Logging. If using a custom container image, the service account must have [Artifact Registry Reader](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#roles) permission to pull the specified image. If you as the administrator want to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, you need to set this value to a service account for which you have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission. Conversely, if you don&#x27;t want anyone to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, use a service account where no one has that permission. If not set, VMs run with a service account provided by the Cloud Workstations service, and the image must be publicly accessible.
      &quot;serviceAccountScopes&quot;: [ # Optional. Scopes to grant to the service_account. When specified, users of workstations under this configuration must have `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` on the service account.
        &quot;A String&quot;,

  &quot;runningTimeout&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Number of seconds that a workstation can run until it is automatically shut down. We recommend that workstations be shut down daily to reduce costs and so that security updates can be applied upon restart. The idle_timeout and running_timeout fields are independent of each other. Note that the running_timeout field shuts down VMs after the specified time, regardless of whether or not the VMs are idle. Provide duration terminated by `s` for seconds—for example, `&quot;54000s&quot;` (15 hours). Defaults to `&quot;43200s&quot;` (12 hours). A value of `&quot;0s&quot;` indicates that workstations using this configuration should never time out. If encryption_key is set, it must be greater than `&quot;0s&quot;` and less than `&quot;86400s&quot;` (24 hours). Warning: A value of `&quot;0s&quot;` indicates that Cloud Workstations VMs created with this configuration have no maximum running time. This is strongly discouraged because you incur costs and will not pick up security updates.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A system-assigned unique identifier for this workstation configuration.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;auditConfigs&quot;: [ # Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    { # Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs: { &quot;audit_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;allServices&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:jose@example.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;ADMIN_READ&quot; } ] }, { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;sampleservice.googleapis.com&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:aliya@example.com&quot; ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging.

Cloud Workstations instances are subject to the [same restrictions as Compute Engine instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/overview#restrictions): * **Organization policy**: projects, folders, or organizations may be restricted from creating nested VMs if the **Disable VM nested virtualization** constraint is enforced in the organization policy. For more information, see the Compute Engine section, [Checking whether nested virtualization is allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/managing-constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed). * **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater decrease in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and possibly greater than a 10% decrease for workloads that are input/output bound. * **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can only be enabled on workstation configurations that specify a machine_type in the N1 or N2 machine series.

If using a custom container image, the service account must have [Artifact Registry Reader](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#roles) permission to pull the specified image. If you as the administrator want to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, you need to set this value to a service account for which you have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission. Conversely, if you don&#x27;t want anyone to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, use a service account where no one has that permission. If not set, VMs run with a service account provided by the Cloud Workstations service, and the image must be publicly accessible.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`.

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as `*` or `storage.*`) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
