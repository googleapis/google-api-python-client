Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource name. If the write user event action is applied in DataStore level, the format is: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection}/dataStores/{data_store}`. If the write user event action is applied in Location level, for example, the event with Document across multiple DataStore, the format is: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. (required)

  &quot;attributes&quot;: { # Extra user event features to include in the recommendation model. These attributes must NOT contain data that needs to be parsed or processed further, e.g. JSON or other encodings. If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events, also include them in the user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events provided with prediction requests. This lets the Discovery Engine API use those custom attributes when training models and serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality. This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. For product recommendations, an example of extra user information is `traffic_channel`, which is how a user arrives at the site. Users can arrive at the site by coming to the site directly, coming through Google search, or in other ways.

This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or conversion completion back to the event and the particular predict response containing this clicked/purchased product. If user clicks on product K in the recommendation results, pass RecommendResponse.attribution_token as a URL parameter to product K&#x27;s page. When recording events on product K&#x27;s page, log the RecommendResponse.attribution_token to this field.

Category pages include special pages such as sales or promotions. For instance, a special sale page may have the category hierarchy: `&quot;pageCategory&quot; : &quot;Sales &gt; 2017 Black Friday Deals&quot;`. Required for `view-category-page` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
    &quot;pageviewId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique ID of a web page view. This should be kept the same for all user events triggered from the same pageview. For example, an item detail page view could trigger multiple events as the user is browsing the page. The `pageview_id` property should be kept the same for all these events so that they can be grouped together properly. When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in automatically.

    &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Highly recommended for logged-in users. Unique identifier for logged-in user, such as a user name. Don&#x27;t set for anonymous users. Always use a hashed value for this ID. Don&#x27;t set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
  },
  &quot;userPseudoId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if the visitor log in/out of the website. Do not set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend to use Google Analytics [Client ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId) for this field.

The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. This can only be set for `search` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
    &quot;searchQuery&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The user&#x27;s search query. See SearchRequest.query for definition. The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. At least one of search_query or PageInfo.page_category is required for `search` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
  },
  &quot;sessionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique identifier for tracking a visitor session with a length limit of 128 bytes. A session is an aggregation of an end user behavior in a time span. A general guideline to populate the session_id: 1. If user has no activity for 30 min, a new session_id should be assigned. 2. The session_id should be unique across users, suggest use uuid or add UserEvent.user_pseudo_id as prefix.
  &quot;tagIds&quot;: [ # A list of identifiers for the independent experiment groups this user event belongs to. This is used to distinguish between user events associated with different experiment setups on the customer end.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;transactionInfo&quot;: { # A transaction represents the entire purchase transaction. # The transaction metadata (if any) associated with this user event.
    &quot;cost&quot;: 3.14, # All the costs associated with the products. These can be manufacturing costs, shipping expenses not borne by the end user, or any other costs, such that: * Profit = value - tax - cost
    &quot;currency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Currency code. Use three-character ISO-4217 code.
    &quot;discountValue&quot;: 3.14, # The total discount(s) value applied to this transaction. This figure should be excluded from TransactionInfo.value For example, if a user paid TransactionInfo.value amount, then nominal (pre-discount) value of the transaction is the sum of TransactionInfo.value and TransactionInfo.discount_value This means that profit is calculated the same way, regardless of the discount value, and that TransactionInfo.discount_value can be larger than TransactionInfo.value: * Profit = value - tax - cost
    &quot;tax&quot;: 3.14, # All the taxes associated with the transaction.
    &quot;transactionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The transaction ID with a length limit of 128 characters.
    &quot;value&quot;: 3.14, # Required. Total non-zero value associated with the transaction. This value may include shipping, tax, or other adjustments to the total value that you want to include.
  },
  &quot;userInfo&quot;: { # Information of an end user. # Information about the end user.
    &quot;userAgent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User agent as included in the HTTP header. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. This should not be set when using the client side event reporting with GTM or JavaScript tag in UserEventService.CollectUserEvent or if UserEvent.direct_user_request is set.
    &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Highly recommended for logged-in users. Unique identifier for logged-in user, such as a user name. Don&#x27;t set for anonymous users. Always use a hashed value for this ID. Don&#x27;t set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
  },
  &quot;userPseudoId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if the visitor log in/out of the website. Do not set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend to use Google Analytics [Client ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId) for this field.
