<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchUpdate">batchUpdate(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sends new spans to Stackdriver Trace or updates existing spans. If the
name of a trace that you send matches that of an existing trace, any fields
in the existing trace and its spans are overwritten by the provided values,
and any new fields provided are merged with the existing trace data. If the
name does not match, a new trace is created with given set of spans.

Args:
  parent: string, ID of the Cloud project where the trace data is stored. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for the `BatchUpdateSpans` method.
    "spanUpdates": { # A map from trace name to spans to be stored or updated.
      "a_key": { # Collection of spans to update.
        "spans": [ # A collection of spans.
          { # A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested
              # and form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes the
              # end-to-end latency and, optionally, one or more subspans for
              # its sub-operations. Spans do not need to be contiguous. There may be gaps
              # between spans in a trace.
            "status": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different # The final status of the Span. This is optional.
                # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
                # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
                #
                # - Simple to use and understand for most users
                # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
                #
                # # Overview
                #
                # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
                # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
                # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
                # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
                # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
                # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
                # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
                # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
                # in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
                #
                # # Language mapping
                #
                # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
                # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
                # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
                # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
                # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
                #
                # # Other uses
                #
                # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
                # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
                # consistent developer experience across different environments.
                #
                # Example uses of this error model include:
                #
                # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
                #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
                #     errors.
                #
                # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
                #     have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
                #
                # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
                #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
                #     each error sub-response.
                #
                # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
                #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
                #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
                #
                # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
                #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

            #
            # # Overview
            #
            # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
            # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
            # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
            # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
            # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
            # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
            # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
            # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
            # in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
            #
            # # Language mapping
            #
            # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
            # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
            # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
            # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
            # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
            #
            # # Other uses
            #
            # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
            # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
            # consistent developer experience across different environments.
            #
            # Example uses of this error model include:
            #
            # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
            #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
            #     errors.
            #
            # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
            #     have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
            #
            # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
            #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
            #     each error sub-response.
            #
            # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
            #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
            #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
            #
            # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
            #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

              # to inform the storage of the mapping. And in subsequent calls, pass in
