<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(userId, dataSourceId, datasetId, modifiedTimeMillis=None, currentTimeMillis=None)</code>
  <pre>Performs an inclusive delete of all data points whose start and end times have any overlap with the time range specified by the dataset ID. For most data types, the entire data point will be deleted. For data types where the time span represents a consistent value (such as com.google.activity.segment), and a data point straddles either end point of the dataset, only the overlapping portion of the data point will be deleted.

Args:
  userId: string, Delete a dataset for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time. (required)
  dataSourceId: string, The data stream ID of the data source that created the dataset. (required)
  datasetId: string, Dataset identifier that is a composite of the minimum data point start time and maximum data point end time represented as nanoseconds from the epoch. The ID is formatted like: "startTime-endTime" where startTime and endTime are 64 bit integers. (required)
  modifiedTimeMillis: string, When the operation was performed on the client.
  currentTimeMillis: string, The client's current time in milliseconds since epoch.
</pre>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(userId, dataSourceId, datasetId, pageToken=None, limit=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns a dataset containing all data points whose start and end times overlap with the specified range of the dataset minimum start time and maximum end time. Specifically, any data point whose start time is less than or equal to the dataset end time and whose end time is greater than or equal to the dataset start time.

Args:
  userId: string, Retrieve a dataset for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time. (required)
  dataSourceId: string, The data stream ID of the data source that created the dataset. (required)
  datasetId: string, Dataset identifier that is a composite of the minimum data point start time and maximum data point end time represented as nanoseconds from the epoch. The ID is formatted like: "startTime-endTime" where startTime and endTime are 64 bit integers. (required)
  pageToken: string, The continuation token, which is used to page through large datasets. To get the next page of a dataset, set this parameter to the value of nextPageToken from the previous response. Each subsequent call will yield a partial dataset with data point end timestamps that are strictly smaller than those in the previous partial response.
  limit: integer, If specified, no more than this many data points will be included in the dataset. If there are more data points in the dataset, nextPageToken will be set in the dataset response.
