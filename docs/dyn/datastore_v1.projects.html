    <code class="details" id="allocateIds">allocateIds(projectId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Allocates IDs for the given keys, which is useful for referencing an entity before it is inserted.

Args:
  projectId: string, Required. The ID of the project against which to make the request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for Datastore.AllocateIds.
  &quot;databaseId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID of the database against which to make the request. &#x27;(default)&#x27; is not allowed; please use empty string &#x27;&#x27; to refer the default database.
  &quot;keys&quot;: [ # Required. A list of keys with incomplete key paths for which to allocate IDs. No key may be reserved/read-only.
    { # A unique identifier for an entity. If a key&#x27;s partition ID or any of its path kinds or names are reserved/read-only, the key is reserved/read-only. A reserved/read-only key is forbidden in certain documented contexts.
      &quot;partitionId&quot;: { # A partition ID identifies a grouping of entities. The grouping is always by project and namespace, however the namespace ID may be empty. A partition ID contains several dimensions: project ID and namespace ID. Partition dimensions: - May be `&quot;&quot;`. - Must be valid UTF-8 bytes. - Must have values that match regex `[A-Za-z\d\.\-_]{1,100}` If the value of any dimension matches regex `__.*__`, the partition is reserved/read-only. A reserved/read-only partition ID is forbidden in certain documented contexts. Foreign partition IDs (in which the project ID does not match the context project ID ) are discouraged. Reads and writes of foreign partition IDs may fail if the project is not in an active state. # Entities are partitioned into subsets, currently identified by a project ID and namespace ID. Queries are scoped to a single partition.
        &quot;databaseId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If not empty, the ID of the database to which the entities belong.

The first element identifies a _root entity_, the second element identifies a _child_ of the root entity, the third element identifies a child of the second entity, and so forth. The entities identified by all prefixes of the path are called the element&#x27;s _ancestors_. An entity path is always fully complete: *all* of the entity&#x27;s ancestors are required to be in the path along with the entity identifier itself. The only exception is that in some documented cases, the identifier in the last path element (for the entity) itself may be omitted. For example, the last path element of the key of `Mutation.insert` may have no identifier. A path can never be empty, and a path can have at most 100 elements.

          &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The kind of the entity. A kind matching regex `__.*__` is reserved/read-only. A kind must not contain more than 1500 bytes when UTF-8 encoded. Cannot be `&quot;&quot;`. Must be valid UTF-8 bytes. Legacy values that are not valid UTF-8 are encoded as `__bytes__` where `` is the base-64 encoding of the bytes.

Recent updates to entities may not be reflected in the export. The export occurs in the background and its progress can be monitored and managed via the Operation resource that is created. The output of an export may only be used once the associated operation is done. If an export operation is cancelled before completion it may leave partial data behind in Google Cloud Storage.

Args:
  projectId: string, Required. Project ID against which to make the request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

For more information about Cloud Storage namespace paths, see [Object name considerations](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming#object-considerations). The resulting files will be nested deeper than the specified URL prefix. The final output URL will be provided in the google.datastore.admin.v1.ExportEntitiesResponse.output_url field. That value should be used for subsequent ImportEntities operations. By nesting the data files deeper, the same Cloud Storage bucket can be used in multiple ExportEntities operations without conflict.
