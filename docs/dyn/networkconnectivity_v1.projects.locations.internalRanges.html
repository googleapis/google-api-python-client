  <pre>Creates a new internal range in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource&#x27;s name of the internal range. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The internal range resource for IPAM operations within a VPC network. Used to represent a private address range along with behavioral characterstics of that range (its usage and peering behavior). Networking resources can link to this range if they are created as belonging to it.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time when the internal range was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of this resource.
  &quot;ipCidrRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The IP range that this internal range defines.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-defined labels.

  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL or resource ID of the network in which to reserve the internal range. The network cannot be deleted if there are any reserved internal ranges referring to it. Legacy networks are not supported. This can only be specified for a global internal address. Example: - URL: /compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/networks/{resourceId} - ID: network123
  &quot;overlaps&quot;: [ # Optional. Types of resources that are allowed to overlap with the current internal range.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],

  &quot;prefixLength&quot;: 42, # An alternate to ip_cidr_range. Can be set when trying to create a reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size. If both ip_cidr_range and prefix_length are set, there is an error if the range sizes do not match. Can also be used during updates to change the range size.
  &quot;targetCidrRange&quot;: [ # Optional. Can be set to narrow down or pick a different address space while searching for a free range. If not set, defaults to the &quot;10.0.0.0/8&quot; address space. This can be used to search in other rfc-1918 address spaces like &quot;172.16.0.0/12&quot; and &quot;192.168.0.0/16&quot; or non-rfc-1918 address spaces used in the VPC.

Can be empty.

  internalRangeId: string, Optional. Resource ID (i.e. &#x27;foo&#x27; in &#x27;[...]/projects/p/locations/l/internalRanges/foo&#x27;) See https://google.aip.dev/122#resource-id-segments Unique per location.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
