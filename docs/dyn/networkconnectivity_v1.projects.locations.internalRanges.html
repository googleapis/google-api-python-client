  <pre>Creates a new internal range in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource&#x27;s name of the internal range. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The internal range resource for IPAM operations within a VPC network. Used to represent a private address range along with behavioral characteristics of that range (its usage and peering behavior). Networking resources can link to this range if they are created as belonging to it.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time when the internal range was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of this resource.
  &quot;ipCidrRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The IP range that this internal range defines. NOTE: IPv6 ranges are limited to usage=EXTERNAL_TO_VPC and peering=FOR_SELF. NOTE: For IPv6 Ranges this field is compulsory, i.e. the address range must be specified explicitly.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # User-defined labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;migration&quot;: { # Specification for migration with source and target resource names. # Optional. Must be present if usage is set to FOR_MIGRATION. This field is for internal use.
    &quot;source&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Resource path as an URI of the source resource, for example a subnet. The project for the source resource should match the project for the InternalRange. An example: /projects/{project}/regions/{region}/subnetworks/{subnet}
    &quot;target&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Resource path of the target resource. The target project can be different, as in the cases when migrating to peer networks. The resource For example: /projects/{project}/regions/{region}/subnetworks/{subnet}
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The name of an internal range. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/internalRanges/{internal_range} See: https://google.aip.dev/122#fields-representing-resource-names
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL or resource ID of the network in which to reserve the internal range. The network cannot be deleted if there are any reserved internal ranges referring to it. Legacy networks are not supported. For example: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network} projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network} {network}
  &quot;overlaps&quot;: [ # Optional. Types of resources that are allowed to overlap with the current internal range.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;peering&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of peering set for this internal range.
  &quot;prefixLength&quot;: 42, # An alternate to ip_cidr_range. Can be set when trying to create an IPv4 reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size. If both ip_cidr_range and prefix_length are set, there is an error if the range sizes do not match. Can also be used during updates to change the range size. NOTE: For IPv6 this field only works if ip_cidr_range is set as well, and both fields must match. In other words, with IPv6 this field only works as a redundant parameter.
  &quot;targetCidrRange&quot;: [ # Optional. Can be set to narrow down or pick a different address space while searching for a free range. If not set, defaults to the &quot;10.0.0.0/8&quot; address space. This can be used to search in other rfc-1918 address spaces like &quot;172.16.0.0/12&quot; and &quot;192.168.0.0/16&quot; or non-rfc-1918 address spaces used in the VPC.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time when the internal range was updated.
  &quot;usage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of usage set for this InternalRange.
  &quot;users&quot;: [ # Output only. The list of resources that refer to this internal range. Resources that use the internal range for their range allocation are referred to as users of the range. Other resources mark themselves as users while doing so by creating a reference to this internal range. Having a user, based on this reference, prevents deletion of the internal range referred to. Can be empty.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  internalRangeId: string, Optional. Resource ID (i.e. &#x27;foo&#x27; in &#x27;[...]/projects/p/locations/l/internalRanges/foo&#x27;) See https://google.aip.dev/122#resource-id-segments Unique per location.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

For example: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network} projects/{project}/locations/global/networks/{network} {network}
  &quot;overlaps&quot;: [ # Optional. Types of resources that are allowed to overlap with the current internal range.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;peering&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of peering set for this internal range.
  &quot;prefixLength&quot;: 42, # An alternate to ip_cidr_range. Can be set when trying to create an IPv4 reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size. If both ip_cidr_range and prefix_length are set, there is an error if the range sizes do not match. Can also be used during updates to change the range size. NOTE: For IPv6 this field only works if ip_cidr_range is set as well, and both fields must match. In other words, with IPv6 this field only works as a redundant parameter.
  &quot;targetCidrRange&quot;: [ # Optional. Can be set to narrow down or pick a different address space while searching for a free range. If not set, defaults to the &quot;10.0.0.0/8&quot; address space. This can be used to search in other rfc-1918 address spaces like &quot;172.16.0.0/12&quot; and &quot;192.168.0.0/16&quot; or non-rfc-1918 address spaces used in the VPC.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Time when the internal range was updated.
  &quot;usage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of usage set for this InternalRange.
  &quot;users&quot;: [ # Output only. The list of resources that refer to this internal range. Resources that use the internal range for their range allocation are referred to as users of the range. Other resources mark themselves as users while doing so by creating a reference to this internal range. Having a user, based on this reference, prevents deletion of the internal range referred to. Can be empty.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the InternalRange resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
