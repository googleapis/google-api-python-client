<p class="firstline">Performs an out-of-band seek for a subscription to a specified target, which may be timestamps or named positions within the message backlog. Seek translates these targets to cursors for each partition and orchestrates subscribers to start consuming messages from these seek cursors. If an operation is returned, the seek has been registered and subscribers will eventually receive messages from the seek cursors (i.e. eventual consistency), as long as they are using a minimum supported client library version and not a system that tracks cursors independently of Pub/Sub Lite (e.g. Apache Beam, Dataflow, Spark). The seek operation will fail for unsupported clients. If clients would like to know when subscribers react to the seek (or not), they can poll the operation. The seek operation will succeed and complete once subscribers are ready to receive messages from the seek cursors for all partitions of the topic. This means that the seek operation will not complete until all subscribers come online. If the previous seek operation has not yet completed, it will be aborted and the new invocation of seek will supersede it.</p>

    &quot;eventTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Request the cursor of the first message with event time greater than or equal to `event_time`. If messages are missing an event time, the publish time is used as a fallback. As event times are user supplied, subsequent messages may have event times less than `event_time` and should be filtered by the client, if necessary.
    &quot;publishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Request the cursor of the first message with publish time greater than or equal to `publish_time`. All messages thereafter are guaranteed to have publish times &gt;= `publish_time`.

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
