<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource.
Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy
set.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetPolicy` method.
    &quot;resource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource for which the policy is being requested.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Defines an access control policy to the resources.
    &quot;assignments&quot;: [
      { # Associates `members` with a `role`.
        &quot;members&quot;: [ # The identities the role is assigned to. It can have the following
