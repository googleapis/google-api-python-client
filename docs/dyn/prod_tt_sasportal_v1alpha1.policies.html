<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetPolicy` method.
  &quot;resource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource for which the policy is being requested.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Defines an access control policy to the resources.
  &quot;assignments&quot;: [ # List of assignments
    { # Associates `members` with a `role`.
      &quot;members&quot;: [ # The identities the role is assigned to. It can have the following values: * `{user_email}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example: `alice@gmail.com`. * `{group_email}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `viewers@gmail.com`.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;role&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Role that is assigned to `members`.
    },
  ],
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to GetPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to SetPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. If no etag is provided in the call to GetPolicy, then the existing policy is overwritten blindly.
