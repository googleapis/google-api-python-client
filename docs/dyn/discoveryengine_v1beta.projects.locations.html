The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing widths.

The sequence of N buckets for a distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N - 1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i &gt; 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1.

  <pre>Removes the dedicated crawl rate for a craw_rate_scope. If the dedicated crawl rate was set, this will disable vertex AI&#x27;s crawl bot from using the dedicated crawl rate for crawling. If the dedicated crawl rate was not set, this is a no-op.

Args:
  location: string, Required. The location resource where crawl rate management will be performed. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;crawlRateScope&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The scope of the crawl rate change. Currently, only domain and host name are supported. A domain name example: `example.com`. A host name example: `www.example.com`. Please do not include `/` in the domain or host name.

    Allowed values

  <pre>Sets the dedicated crawl rate for a crawl_rate_scope. If the dedicated crawl rate was not set, this will enable vertex AI&#x27;s crawl bot to use the new dedicated crawl rate for crawling. If the dedicated crawl rate was set, vertex AI&#x27;s crawl bot will try to update the rate to the new value. If the new value is too high, the crawl bot may crawl at a lower rate to avoid overloading the user&#x27;s website.

A domain name example: `example.com`. A host name example: `www.example.com`. Please do not include `/` in the domain or host name.
  &quot;crawlType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Whether it&#x27;s the crawl rate of user-triggered or auto-refresh.
