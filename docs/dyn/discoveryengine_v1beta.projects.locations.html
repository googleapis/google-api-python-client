The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing widths.

The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i &gt; 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1.

Examples include virtual machine instances, databases, and storage devices such as disks. The `type` field identifies a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object that describes the resource&#x27;s schema. Information in the `labels` field identifies the actual resource and its attributes according to the schema. For example, a particular Compute Engine VM instance could be represented by the following object, because the MonitoredResourceDescriptor for `&quot;gce_instance&quot;` has labels `&quot;project_id&quot;`, `&quot;instance_id&quot;` and `&quot;zone&quot;`: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;gce_instance&quot;, &quot;labels&quot;: { &quot;project_id&quot;: &quot;my-project&quot;, &quot;instance_id&quot;: &quot;12345678901234&quot;, &quot;zone&quot;: &quot;us-central1-a&quot; }} # The associated monitored resource. Custom metrics can use only certain monitored resource types in their time series data. For more information, see [Monitored resources for custom metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics/creating-metrics#custom-metric-resources).
          &quot;labels&quot;: { # Required. Values for all of the labels listed in the associated monitored resource descriptor. For example, Compute Engine VM instances use the labels `&quot;project_id&quot;`, `&quot;instance_id&quot;`, and `&quot;zone&quot;`.
            &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
          },
          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The monitored resource type. This field must match the `type` field of a MonitoredResourceDescriptor object. For example, the type of a Compute Engine VM instance is `gce_instance`. Some descriptors include the service name in the type; for example, the type of a Datastream stream is `datastream.googleapis.com/Stream`.
        },
        &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or `DISTRIBUTION`. The `unit` defines the representation of the stored metric values. This field can only be changed through CreateTimeSeries when it is empty.
        &quot;valueType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The value type of the time series. When listing time series, this value type might be different from the value type of the associated metric if this time series is an alignment or reduction of other time series. When creating a time series, this field is optional. If present, it must be the same as the type of the data in the `points` field.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="removeDedicatedCrawlRate">removeDedicatedCrawlRate(location, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Removes the dedicated crawl rate for a craw_rate_scope. If the dedicated crawl rate was set, this will disable vertex AI&#x27;s crawl bot from using the dedicated crawl rate for crawling. If the dedicated crawl rate was not set, this is a no-op.

Args:
  location: string, Required. The location resource where crawl rate management will be performed. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CrawlRateManagementService.RemoveDedicatedCrawlRate method. The user can remove the dedicated crawl rate for a crawl_rate_scope they own, and Google will fall back to organic crawl, and the crawl rate will be determined by Google.
  &quot;crawlRateScope&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The scope of the crawl rate change. Currently, only domain and host name are supported. A domain name example: `example.com`. A host name example: `www.example.com`. Please do not include `/` in the domain or host name.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setDedicatedCrawlRate">setDedicatedCrawlRate(location, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the dedicated crawl rate for a crawl_rate_scope. If the dedicated crawl rate was not set, this will enable vertex AI&#x27;s crawl bot to use the new dedicated crawl rate for crawling. If the dedicated crawl rate was set, vertex AI&#x27;s crawl bot will try to update the rate to the new value. If the new value is too high, the crawl bot may crawl at a lower rate to avoid overloading the user&#x27;s website.

Args:
  location: string, Required. The location resource where crawl rate management will be performed. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CrawlRateManagementService.SetDedicatedCrawlRate method. The user can set the crawl rate for a crawl_rate_scope they own. They can set up an overall crawl rate, or set up a user-triggered crawl rate and a auto-refresh crawl rate separately. If an overall crawl rate is set, Vertex AI will automatically splits crawl_rate into user-triggered and auto-refresh.
  &quot;crawlRate&quot;: 42, # Optional. The crawl QPS set by the user. It is not guaranteed that Vertex crawl bot will crawl at this QPS. If the crawl rate is too high, the real QPS may be lower than the value set by the user to avoid overloading the user&#x27;s website.
  &quot;crawlRateScope&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The scope of the crawl rate that the user wants to config. Currently, only domain and host name are supported. A domain name example: `example.com`. A host name example: `www.example.com`. Please do not include `/` in the domain or host name.
  &quot;crawlType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Whether it&#x27;s the crawl rate of user-triggered or auto-refresh.
  &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Whether the rate is explicitly set by users, or set by vertex AI.
