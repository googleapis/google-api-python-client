The following field masks are supported for mediation group updates: - &quot;mediation_group_lines[\&quot;{mediation_group_line_id}\&quot;]&quot; clang-format off - &quot;mediation_group_lines[\&quot;{mediation_group_line_id}\&quot;].ad_unit_mappings[\&quot;{ad_unit_id}\&quot;]&quot; clang-format on - &quot;mediation_group_lines[\&quot;{mediation_group_line_id}\&quot;].cpm_micros&quot; - &quot;mediation_group_lines[\&quot;{mediation_group_line_id}\&quot;].cpm_mode&quot; - &quot;mediation_group_lines[\&quot;{mediation_group_line_id}\&quot;].state&quot; - &quot;mediation_group_lines[\&quot;{mediation_group_line_id}\&quot;].display_name&quot; - &quot;targeting.ad_unit_ids&quot; To update a mediation group with a new mediation group line, use a distinct negative number for the &quot;mediation_group_line_id&quot;. For Example: update_mask { paths: &quot;mediation_group_lines[\&quot;123456789012345\&quot;].cpm_micros&quot; }
