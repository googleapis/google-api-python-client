  <pre>Restore a CryptoKeyVersion in the
DESTROY_SCHEDULED
state.

Upon restoration of the CryptoKeyVersion, state
will be set to DISABLED,
and destroy_time will be cleared.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the CryptoKeyVersion to restore. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for KeyManagementService.RestoreCryptoKeyVersion.
