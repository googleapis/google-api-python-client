    <code class="details" id="asymmetricDecrypt">asymmetricDecrypt(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Decrypts data that was encrypted with a public key retrieved from GetPublicKey corresponding to a CryptoKeyVersion with CryptoKey.purpose ASYMMETRIC_DECRYPT.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the CryptoKeyVersion to use for decryption. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for KeyManagementService.AsymmetricDecrypt.
  &quot;ciphertext&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The data encrypted with the named CryptoKeyVersion&#x27;s public key using OAEP.
  &quot;ciphertextCrc32c&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An optional CRC32C checksum of the AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext. If specified, KeyManagementService will verify the integrity of the received AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext using this checksum. KeyManagementService will report an error if the checksum verification fails. If you receive a checksum error, your client should verify that CRC32C(AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext) is equal to AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext_crc32c, and if so, perform a limited number of retries. A persistent mismatch may indicate an issue in your computation of the CRC32C checksum. Note: This field is defined as int64 for reasons of compatibility across different languages. However, it is a non-negative integer, which will never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in languages that support this type.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

An integrity check of AsymmetricDecryptResponse.plaintext can be performed by computing the CRC32C checksum of AsymmetricDecryptResponse.plaintext and comparing your results to this field. Discard the response in case of non-matching checksum values, and perform a limited number of retries. A persistent mismatch may indicate an issue in your computation of the CRC32C checksum. Note: This field is defined as int64 for reasons of compatibility across different languages. However, it is a non-negative integer, which will never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in languages that support this type.

  &quot;verifiedCiphertextCrc32c&quot;: True or False, # Integrity verification field. A flag indicating whether AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext_crc32c was received by KeyManagementService and used for the integrity verification of the ciphertext. A false value of this field indicates either that AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext_crc32c was left unset or that it was not delivered to KeyManagementService. If you&#x27;ve set AsymmetricDecryptRequest.ciphertext_crc32c but this field is still false, discard the response and perform a limited number of retries.

  &quot;dataCrc32c&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An optional CRC32C checksum of the MacVerifyRequest.data. If specified, KeyManagementService will verify the integrity of the received MacVerifyRequest.data using this checksum. KeyManagementService will report an error if the checksum verification fails.

    { # A CryptoKeyVersion represents an individual cryptographic key, and the associated key material. An ENABLED version can be used for cryptographic operations. For security reasons, the raw cryptographic key material represented by a CryptoKeyVersion can never be viewed or exported. It can only be used to encrypt, decrypt, or sign data when an authorized user or application invokes Cloud KMS.

For more information, see [Verifying attestations] (https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/attest-key). # Output only. Statement that was generated and signed by the HSM at key creation time. Use this statement to verify attributes of the key as stored on the HSM, independently of Google. Only provided for key versions with protection_level HSM.
    &quot;certChains&quot;: { # Certificate chains needed to verify the attestation. Certificates in chains are PEM-encoded and are ordered based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.2. # Output only. The certificate chains needed to validate the attestation

  &quot;destroyEventTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time this CryptoKeyVersion&#x27;s key material was destroyed. Only present if state is DESTROYED.
  &quot;destroyTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time this CryptoKeyVersion&#x27;s key material is scheduled for destruction. Only present if state is DESTROY_SCHEDULED.
  &quot;externalDestructionFailureReason&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The root cause of the most recent external destruction failure. Only present if state is EXTERNAL_DESTRUCTION_FAILED.
  &quot;externalProtectionLevelOptions&quot;: { # ExternalProtectionLevelOptions stores a group of additional fields for configuring a CryptoKeyVersion that are specific to the EXTERNAL protection level and EXTERNAL_VPC protection levels. # ExternalProtectionLevelOptions stores a group of additional fields for configuring a CryptoKeyVersion that are specific to the EXTERNAL protection level and EXTERNAL_VPC protection levels.
    &quot;ekmConnectionKeyPath&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The path to the external key material on the EKM when using EkmConnection e.g., &quot;v0/my/key&quot;. Set this field instead of external_key_uri when using an EkmConnection.
    &quot;externalKeyUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URI for an external resource that this CryptoKeyVersion represents.
  },
  &quot;generateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time this CryptoKeyVersion&#x27;s key material was generated.
  &quot;generationFailureReason&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The root cause of the most recent generation failure. Only present if state is GENERATION_FAILED.
  &quot;importFailureReason&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The root cause of the most recent import failure. Only present if state is IMPORT_FAILED.
  &quot;importJob&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the ImportJob used in the most recent import of this CryptoKeyVersion. Only present if the underlying key material was imported.
  &quot;importTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which this CryptoKeyVersion&#x27;s key material was most recently imported.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name for this CryptoKeyVersion in the format `projects/*/locations/*/keyRings/*/cryptoKeys/*/cryptoKeyVersions/*`.
  &quot;protectionLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The ProtectionLevel describing how crypto operations are performed with this CryptoKeyVersion.
  &quot;reimportEligible&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Whether or not this key version is eligible for reimport, by being specified as a target in ImportCryptoKeyVersionRequest.crypto_key_version.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The current state of the CryptoKeyVersion.
