  <pre>Creates a new topic.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent location in which to create the topic. Structured like `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    },
    &quot;count&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The number of partitions in the topic. Must be at least 1. Once a topic has been created the number of partitions can be increased but not decreased. Message ordering is not guaranteed across a topic resize. For more information see https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/lite/docs/topics#scaling_capacity
    &quot;scale&quot;: 42, # DEPRECATED: Use capacity instead which can express a superset of configurations. Every partition in the topic is allocated throughput equivalent to `scale` times the standard partition throughput (4 MiB/s).
