  <pre>Generates a sign-up URL.

Args:
  callbackUrl: string, The callback URL to which the Admin will be redirected after successfully creating an enterprise. Before redirecting there the system will add a single query parameter to this URL named "enterpriseToken" which will contain an opaque token to be used for the CompleteSignup request.

    <code class="details" id="pullNotificationSet">pullNotificationSet(requestMode=None)</code>
  <pre>Pulls and returns a notification set for the enterprises associated with the service account authenticated for the request. The notification set may be empty if no notification are pending.
A notification set returned needs to be acknowledged within 20 seconds by calling Enterprises​.AcknowledgeNotificationSet, unless the notification set is empty.
Notifications that are not acknowledged within the 20 seconds will eventually be included again in the response to another PullNotificationSet request, and those that are never acknowledged will ultimately be deleted according to the Google Cloud Platform Pub/Sub system policy.
Multiple requests might be performed concurrently to retrieve notifications, in which case the pending notifications (if any) will be split among each caller, if any are pending.
If no notifications are present, an empty notification list is returned. Subsequent requests may return more notifications once they become available.

Args:
  requestMode: string, The request mode for pulling notifications.
Specifying waitForNotifications will cause the request to block and wait until one or more notifications are present, or return an empty notification list if no notifications are present after some time.
Speciying returnImmediately will cause the request to immediately return the pending notifications, or an empty list if no notifications are present.
If omitted, defaults to waitForNotifications.
