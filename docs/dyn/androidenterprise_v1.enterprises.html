<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(enterpriseId)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the binding between the EMM and enterprise. This is now deprecated; use this to unenroll customers that were previously enrolled with the 'insert' call, then enroll them again with the 'enroll' call.

Args:
  enterpriseId: string, The ID of the enterprise. (required)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="enroll">enroll(token, body)</code>
  <pre>Enrolls an enterprise with the calling EMM.

Args:
  token: string, The token provided by the enterprise to register the EMM. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An enterprise resource represents a binding between an organisation and their EMM.
      # 
      # To create an enterprise, an admin of the enterprise must first go through a Play for Work sign-up flow. At the end of this the admin will be presented with a token (a short opaque alphanumeric string). They must then present this to the EMM, who then supplies it to the enroll method. Until this is done the EMM will not have any access to the enterprise.
      # 
      # After calling enroll the EMM should call setAccount to specify the service account that will be allowed to act on behalf of the enterprise, which will be required for access to the enterprise's data through this API. Only one call of setAccount is allowed for a given enterprise; the only way to change the account later is to unenroll the enterprise and enroll it again (obtaining a new token).
      # 
      # The EMM can unenroll an enterprise in order to sever the binding between them. Re-enrolling an enterprise is possible, but requires a new token to be retrieved. Enterprises.unenroll requires the EMM's credentials (as enroll does), not the enterprise's. Enterprises.unenroll can only be used for enterprises that were previously enrolled with the enroll call. Any enterprises that were enrolled using the (deprecated) Enterprises.insert call must be unenrolled with Enterprises.delete and can then be re-enrolled using the Enterprises.enroll call.
      # 
      # The ID for an enterprise is an opaque string. It is returned by insert and enroll and can also be retrieved if the enterprise's primary domain is known using the list method.
    "kind": "androidenterprise#enterprise", # Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "androidenterprise#enterprise".
    "primaryDomain": "A String", # The enterprise's primary domain, e.g. "example.com".
    "id": "A String", # The unique ID for the enterprise.
    "name": "A String", # The name of the enterprise, e.g. "Example Inc".
