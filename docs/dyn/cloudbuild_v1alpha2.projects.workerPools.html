  <pre>Creates a `WorkerPool` to run the builds, and returns the new worker pool.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource where this book will be created. Format: projects/{project} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Configuration for a WorkerPool to run the builds. Workers are machines that Cloud Build uses to run your builds. By default, all workers run in a project owned by Cloud Build. To have full control over the workers that execute your builds -- such as enabling them to access private resources on your private network -- you can request Cloud Build to run the workers in your own project by creating a custom workers pool.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time at which the request to create the `WorkerPool` was received.
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time at which the request to delete the `WorkerPool` was received.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the `WorkerPool`. Format of the name is `projects/{project_id}/workerPools/{worker_pool_id}`, where the value of {worker_pool_id} is provided in the CreateWorkerPool request.
  &quot;networkConfig&quot;: { # Network describes the network configuration for a `WorkerPool`. # Network configuration for the `WorkerPool`.
    &quot;peeredNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The network definition that the workers are peered to. If this section is left empty, the workers will be peered to WorkerPool.project_id on the default network. Must be in the format `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`, where {project} is a project number, such as `12345`, and {network} is the name of a VPC network in the project.
  },
  &quot;region&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The region where the `WorkerPool` runs. Only &quot;us-central1&quot; is currently supported. Note that `region` cannot be changed once the `WorkerPool` is created.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. WorkerPool state.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time at which the request to update the `WorkerPool` was received.
  &quot;workerConfig&quot;: { # WorkerConfig defines the configuration to be used for a creating workers in the pool. # Worker configuration for the `WorkerPool`.
    &quot;diskSizeGb&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Size of the disk attached to the worker, in GB. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/ If `0` is specified, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.
    &quot;machineType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Machine Type of the worker, such as n1-standard-1. See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types. If left blank, Cloud Build will use a standard unspecified machine to create the worker pool.
  },
}

  workerPoolId: string, Required. Immutable. The ID to use for the `WorkerPool`, which will become the final component of the resource name. This value should be 1-63 characters, and valid characters are /a-z-/.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
