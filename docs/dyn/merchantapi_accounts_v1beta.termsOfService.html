    { # Response message for the `AcceptTermsOfService` method.
  &quot;termsOfServiceAgreementState&quot;: { # This resource represents the agreement state for a given account and terms of service kind. The state is as follows: * If the business has accepted a terms of service, `accepted` will be populated, otherwise it will be empty * If the business must sign a terms of service, `required` will be populated, otherwise it will be empty. Note that both `required` and `accepted` can be present. In this case the `accepted` terms of services will have an expiration date set in the `valid_until` field. The `required` terms of services need to be accepted before `valid_until` in order for the account to continue having a valid agreement. When accepting new terms of services we expect third-party providers to display the text associated with the given terms of service agreement (the url to the file containing the text is added in the Required message below as `tos_file_uri`). The actual acceptance of the terms of service is done by calling accept on the `TermsOfService` resource. `valid_until` field. # The agreement state after accepting the ToS.

Related types: * google.type.TimeOfDay * google.type.DateTime * google.protobuf.Timestamp # Optional.
