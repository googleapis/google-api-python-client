If there is a registered account, fetches all providers associated with the account's email. If the provider ID of an Identity Provider (IdP) is specified, creates an authorization URI for the IdP. The user can be directed to this URI to sign in with the IdP.

The Apple platform Firebase SDK will use `gamePlayerID` and `teamPlayerID` from version 10.5.0 and onwards. Upgrading to SDK version 10.5.0 or later updates existing integrations that use `playerID` to instead use `gamePlayerID` and `teamPlayerID`. When making calls to `signInWithGameCenter`, you must include `playerID` along with the new fields `gamePlayerID` and `teamPlayerID` to successfully identify all existing users. Upgrading existing Game Center sign in integrations to SDK version 10.5.0 or later is irreversible.</p>

A new Identity Platform user account will be created if the user has not previously signed in to the IdP with the same account. In addition, when the "One account per email address" setting is enabled, there should not be an existing Identity Platform user account with the same email address for a new user account to be created.

For example, if the user is signing in to the Google provider using a Google ID token, this should be set to id_token`=[GOOGLE_ID_TOKEN]&amp;providerId=google.com`, where `[GOOGLE_ID_TOKEN]` should be replaced with the Google ID token. If the user is signing in to the Facebook provider using a Facebook authentication token, this should be set to id_token`=[FACEBOOK_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN]&amp;providerId=facebook. com&amp;nonce= [NONCE]`, where `[FACEBOOK_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN]` should be replaced with the Facebook authentication token. Nonce is required for validating the token. The request will fail if no nonce is provided. If the user is signing in to the Facebook provider using a Facebook access token, this should be set to access_token`=[FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN]&amp;providerId=facebook. com`, where `[FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN]` should be replaced with the Facebook access token. If the user is signing in to the Twitter provider using a Twitter OAuth 1.0 credential, this should be set to access_token`=[TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN]&amp;oauth_token_secret= [TWITTER_TOKEN_SECRET]&amp;providerId=twitter.com`, where `[TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN]` and `[TWITTER_TOKEN_SECRET]` should be replaced with the Twitter OAuth access token and Twitter OAuth token secret respectively.

  <pre>Verifies an iOS client is a real iOS device. If the request is valid, a receipt will be sent in the response and a secret will be sent via Apple Push Notification Service. The client should send both of them back to certain Identity Platform APIs in a later call (for example, /accounts:sendVerificationCode), in order to verify the client. The bundle ID is required in the request header as `x-ios-bundle-identifier`. An [API key](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys) is required in the request in order to identify the Google Cloud project.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for VerifyIosClient
  &quot;appToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A device token that the iOS client gets after registering to APNs (Apple Push Notification service).
  &quot;isSandbox&quot;: True or False, # Whether the app token is in the iOS sandbox. If false, the app token is in the production environment.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
