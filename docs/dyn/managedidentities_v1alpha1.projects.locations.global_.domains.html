    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does not apply to the current request.

For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

  <pre>Validate the trust state Operation

Args:
  name: string, The resource domain name, project name, and location using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/domains/{domain_name}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;trust&quot;: { # Represents a relationship between two domains which makes it possible for users in one domain to be authenticated by a dc in another domain. Refer https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc731335(v%3dws.10) If the trust is being changed, it will be placed into the UPDATING state, which indicates that the resource is being reconciled. At this point, Get will reflect an intermediate state. # The domain trust to validate trust state for.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the instance was created.
    &quot;lastKnownTrustConnectedHeartbeatTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last heartbeat time when the trust was known to be connected.
    &quot;selectiveAuthentication&quot;: True or False, # The trust authentication type which decides whether the trusted side has forest/domain wide access or selective access to approved set of resources.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of this trust.
    &quot;stateDescription&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Additional information about the current state of this trust, if available.
    &quot;targetDnsIpAddresses&quot;: [ # The target dns server ip addresses which can resolve the remote domain involved in trust.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;targetDomainName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The fully qualified target domain name which will be in trust with current domain.
    &quot;trustDirection&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The trust direction decides the current domain is trusted, trusting or both.
    &quot;trustHandshakeSecret&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Input only, and will not be stored. The trust secret used for handshake with target domain.
    &quot;trustType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of trust represented by the trust resource.
    &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time.
  },
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
