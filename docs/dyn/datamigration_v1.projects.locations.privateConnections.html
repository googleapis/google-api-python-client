  <pre>Creates a new private connection in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent that owns the collection of PrivateConnections. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The PrivateConnection resource is used to establish private connectivity with the customer&#x27;s network.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The create time of the resource.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The private connection display name.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Output only. The error details in case of state FAILED.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # The resource labels for private connections to use to annotate any related underlying resources such as Compute Engine VMs. An object containing a list of &quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot; pairs. Example: `{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;wrench&quot;, &quot;mass&quot;: &quot;1.3kg&quot;, &quot;count&quot;: &quot;3&quot; }`.

  },
}

  privateConnectionId: string, Required. The private connection identifier.
  requestId: string, Optional. A unique id used to identify the request. If the server receives two requests with the same id, then the second request will be ignored.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
