  <pre>CreateObservationSource creates a new ObservationSource but does not affect any deployed infrastructure. It is a configuration that can be used in an Observation Job to collect data about APIs running in user&#x27;s dataplane.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Value for parent. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Observation source configuration types
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Create time stamp
  &quot;gclbObservationSource&quot;: { # The GCLB observation source. # The GCLB observation source
    &quot;pscNetworkConfigs&quot;: [ # Required. The VPC networks where traffic will be observed. All load balancers within this network will be observed. Currently, this is limited to only one network.
      { # Network information for setting up a PSC connection.
        &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The VPC network. Format: `projects/{project_id}/global/networks/{network}`
        &quot;subnetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The subnetwork in the source region that will be used to connect to the Cloud Load Balancers via PSC NEGs. Must belong to `network`. Format: projects/{project_id}/regions/{region}/subnetworks/{subnet}
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. name of resource For MVP, each region can only have 1 source.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The observation source state
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. [Output only] Update time stamp
}

  observationSourceId: string, Required. The ID to use for the Observation Source. This value should be 4-63 characters, and valid characters are /a-z-/.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
