  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Used to perform a consistent read-modify-write updates. If not set, a blind &quot;overwrite&quot; update happens.
  &quot;isDefault&quot;: True or False, # Used to indicate if the TensorBoard instance is the default one. Each project &amp; region can have at most one default TensorBoard instance. Creation of a default TensorBoard instance and updating an existing TensorBoard instance to be default will mark all other TensorBoard instances (if any) as non default.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your Tensorboards. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one Tensorboard (System labels are excluded). See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with &quot;aiplatform.googleapis.com/&quot; and are immutable.

  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when this Tensorboard was last updated.
}

  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Tensorboard resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field is overwritten if it&#x27;s in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields are overwritten if new values are specified.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
