Args:
  parent: string, Required. The &quot;resource name&quot; of the region or location, as described in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For projects.regions.autoscalingPolicies.create, the resource name has the following format: projects/{project_id}/regions/{region} For projects.locations.autoscalingPolicies.create, the resource name has the following format: projects/{project_id}/locations/{location} (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes an autoscaling policy for Dataproc cluster autoscaler.
  &quot;basicAlgorithm&quot;: { # Basic algorithm for autoscaling.
    &quot;cooldownPeriod&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Duration between scaling events. A scaling period starts after the update operation from the previous event has completed.Bounds: 2m, 1d. Default: 2m.

      &quot;gracefulDecommissionTimeout&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Timeout for YARN graceful decommissioning of Node Managers. Specifies the duration to wait for jobs to complete before forcefully removing workers (and potentially interrupting jobs). Only applicable to downscaling operations.Bounds: 0s, 1d.
      &quot;scaleDownFactor&quot;: 3.14, # Required. Fraction of average YARN pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to remove workers. A scale-down factor of 1 will result in scaling down so that there is no available memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling). A scale-down factor of 0 disables removing workers, which can be beneficial for autoscaling a single job. See How autoscaling works for more information.Bounds: 0.0, 1.0.
      &quot;scaleDownMinWorkerFraction&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Minimum scale-down threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must recommend at least a 2 worker scale-down for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0 means the autoscaler will scale down on any recommended change.Bounds: 0.0, 1.0. Default: 0.0.
      &quot;scaleUpFactor&quot;: 3.14, # Required. Fraction of average YARN pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to add workers. A scale-up factor of 1.0 will result in scaling up so that there is no pending memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling). A scale-up factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling up (less aggressive scaling). See How autoscaling works for more information.Bounds: 0.0, 1.0.
      &quot;scaleUpMinWorkerFraction&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Minimum scale-up threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must recommend at least a 2-worker scale-up for the cluster to scale.

For example, if primary workers have weight 2, and secondary workers have weight 1, the cluster will have approximately 2 primary workers for each secondary worker.The cluster may not reach the specified balance if constrained by min/max bounds or other autoscaling settings. For example, if max_instances for secondary workers is 0, then only primary workers will be added. The cluster can also be out of balance when created.If weight is not set on any instance group, the cluster will default to equal weight for all groups: the cluster will attempt to maintain an equal number of workers in each group within the configured size bounds for each group.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds one or more members to a single role. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).JSON example: { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } YAML example: bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
