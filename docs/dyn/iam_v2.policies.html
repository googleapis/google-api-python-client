  <pre>Creates a policy.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource that the policy is attached to, along with the kind of policy to create. Format: `policies/{attachment_point}/denypolicies` The attachment point is identified by its URL-encoded full resource name, which means that the forward-slash character, `/`, must be written as `%2F`. For example, `policies/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2Fmy-project/denypolicies`. For organizations and folders, use the numeric ID in the full resource name. For projects, you can use the alphanumeric or the numeric ID. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Data for an IAM policy.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An opaque tag that identifies the current version of the `Policy`.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The resource name of the `Policy`, which must be unique. Format: `policies/{attachment_point}/denypolicies/{policy_id}` The attachment point is identified by its URL-encoded full resource name, which means that the forward-slash character, `/`, must be written as `%2F`. For example, `policies/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2Fmy-project/denypolicies/my-deny-policy`. For organizations and folders, use the numeric ID in the full resource name.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="listPolicies">listPolicies(parent, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the policies of the specified kind that are attached to a resource. The response lists only policy metadata. In particular, policy rules are omitted.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource that the policy is attached to, along with the kind of policy to list. Format: `policies/{attachment_point}/denypolicies` The attachment point is identified by its URL-encoded full resource name, which means that the forward-slash character, `/`, must be written as `%2F`. For example, `policies/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Fprojects%2Fmy-project/denypolicies`. For organizations and folders, use the numeric ID in the full resource name. For projects, you can use the alphanumeric or the numeric ID. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of policies to return. IAM ignores this value and uses the value 1000.
  pageToken: string, A page token received in a ListPoliciesResponse. Provide this token to retrieve the next page.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

    <code class="details" id="update">update(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the specified policy. You can update only the rules and the display name for the policy. To update a policy, you should use a read-modify-write loop: 1. Use GetPolicy to read the current version of the policy. 2. Modify the policy as needed. 3. Use `UpdatePolicy` to write the updated policy. This pattern helps prevent conflicts between concurrent updates.
