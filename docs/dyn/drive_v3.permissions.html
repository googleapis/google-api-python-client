    The object takes the form of:

{ # A permission for a file. A permission grants a user, group, domain, or the world access to a file or a folder hierarchy. For more information, see [Share files, folders, and drives](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-sharing). By default, permission requests only return a subset of fields. Permission `kind`, `ID`, `type`, and `role` are always returned. To retrieve specific fields, see [Return specific fields](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/fields-parameter). Some resource methods (such as `permissions.update`) require a `permissionId`. Use the `permissions.list` method to retrieve the ID for a file, folder, or shared drive.
