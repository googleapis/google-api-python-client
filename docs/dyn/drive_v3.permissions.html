  emailMessage: string, A plain text custom message to include in the notification email.
  enforceSingleParent: boolean, Deprecated. See moveToNewOwnersRoot for details.
  moveToNewOwnersRoot: boolean, This parameter will only take effect if the item is not in a shared drive and the request is attempting to transfer the ownership of the item.
