  <pre>Lists all the rate plans for an API product.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the API product. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}/apiproducts/{apiproduct}` Use `organizations/{org}/apiproducts/-` to return rate plans for all API products within the organization. (required)
  count: integer, Number of rate plans to return in the API call. Use with the `startKey` parameter to provide more targeted filtering. The maximum limit is 1000. Defaults to 100.
  expand: boolean, Flag that specifies whether to expand the results. Set to `true` to get expanded details about each API. Defaults to `false`.
  orderBy: string, Name of the attribute used for sorting. Valid values include: * `name`: Name of the rate plan. * `state`: State of the rate plan (`DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`). * `startTime`: Time when the rate plan becomes active. * `endTime`: Time when the rate plan expires. **Note**: Not supported by Apigee at this time.
  startKey: string, Name of the rate plan from which to start displaying the list of rate plans. If omitted, the list starts from the first item. For example, to view the rate plans from 51-150, set the value of `startKey` to the name of the 51st rate plan and set the value of `count` to 100.
  state: string, State of the rate plans (`DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`) that you want to display.
    Allowed values
      STATE_UNSPECIFIED - State of the rate plan is not specified.
      DRAFT - Rate plan is in draft mode and only visible to API providers.
      PUBLISHED - Rate plan is published and will become visible to developers for the configured duration (between `startTime` and `endTime`).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
