  <pre>Query metrics.

Args:
  location: string, Required. The location of the data. &quot;projects/{project}/locations/{location}&quot; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for querying metrics.
  &quot;dimensions&quot;: [ # The dimensions that determine the grouping key for the query. Defaults to no dimension if this field is unspecified. If a dimension is specified, its key must also be specified. Each dimension&#x27;s key must be unique. If a time granularity is also specified, metric values in the dimension will be bucketed by this granularity. Up to one dimension is supported for now.
    { # A dimension determines the grouping key for the query. In SQL terms, these would be part of both the &quot;SELECT&quot; and &quot;GROUP BY&quot; clauses.

  &quot;measureMask&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Measures to return. Defaults to all measures if this field is unspecified. A valid mask should traverse from the `measure` field from the response. For example, a path from a measure mask to get the conversation count is &quot;conversation_measure.count&quot;.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
