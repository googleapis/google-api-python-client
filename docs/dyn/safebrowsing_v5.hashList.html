  <pre>Gets the latest contents of a hash list. A hash list may either by a threat list or a non-threat list such as the Global Cache. This is a standard Get method as defined by https://google.aip.dev/131 and the HTTP method is also GET.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of this particular hash list. It may be a threat list, or it may be the Global Cache. (required)
  sizeConstraints_maxDatabaseEntries: integer, Sets the maximum number of entries that the client is willing to have in the local database for the list. (The server MAY cause the client to store less than this number of entries.) If omitted or zero, no database size limit is set.
  sizeConstraints_maxUpdateEntries: integer, The maximum size in number of entries. The update will not contain more entries than this value, but it is possible that the update will contain fewer entries than this value. This MUST be at least 1024. If omitted or zero, no update size limit is set.
  version: string, The version of the hash list that the client already has. If this is the first time the client is fetching the hash list, this field MUST be left empty. Otherwise, the client SHOULD supply the version previously received from the server. The client MUST NOT manipulate those bytes. **What&#x27;s new in V5**: in V4 of the API, this was called `states`; it is now renamed to `version` for clarity.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;additionsFourBytes&quot;: { # The Rice-Golomb encoded data. Used for either hashes or removal indices. It is guaranteed that every hash or index here has the same length, and this length is exactly 32 bits.

This means that if we also take the adjacent difference between entries, the higher order bits have a high probability of being zero. This exploits this high probability of zero by essentially choosing a certain number of bits; all bits more significant than this are likely to be zero so we use unary encoding. See the `rice_parameter` field. Historical note: the Rice-delta encoding was first used in V4 of this API. In V5, two significant improvements were made: firstly, the Rice-delta encoding is now available with hash prefixes longer than 4 bytes; secondly, the encoded data are now treated as big-endian so as to avoid a costly sorting step. # The 4-byte additions.
