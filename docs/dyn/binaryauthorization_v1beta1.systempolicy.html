  <pre>Gets the current system policy in the specified location.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name, in the format `locations/*/policy`. Note that the system policy is not associated with a project. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A policy for container image binary authorization.
  &quot;admissionWhitelistPatterns&quot;: [ # Optional. Admission policy allowlisting. A matching admission request will always be permitted. This feature is typically used to exclude Google or third-party infrastructure images from Binary Authorization policies.
    { # An admission allowlist pattern exempts images from checks by admission rules.
      &quot;namePattern&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An image name pattern to allowlist, in the form `registry/path/to/image`. This supports a trailing `*` as a wildcard, but this is allowed only in text after the `registry/` part. Also wildcards do not match `/`, i.e., gcr.io/nginx* matches gcr.io/nginx@latest, but it does not match gcr.io/nginx/image.
    },
  ],
  &quot;clusterAdmissionRules&quot;: { # Optional. Per-cluster admission rules. Cluster spec format: `location.clusterId`. There can be at most one admission rule per cluster spec. A `location` is either a compute zone (e.g. us-central1-a) or a region (e.g. us-central1). For `clusterId` syntax restrictions see https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.zones.clusters.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: { # An admission rule specifies either that all container images used in a pod creation request must be attested to by one or more attestors, that all pod creations will be allowed, or that all pod creations will be denied. Images matching an admission allowlist pattern are exempted from admission rules and will never block a pod creation.
      &quot;enforcementMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The action when a pod creation is denied by the admission rule.
      &quot;evaluationMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. How this admission rule will be evaluated.
      &quot;requireAttestationsBy&quot;: [ # Optional. The resource names of the attestors that must attest to a container image, in the format `projects/*/attestors/*`. Each attestor must exist before a policy can reference it. To add an attestor to a policy the principal issuing the policy change request must be able to read the attestor resource.
