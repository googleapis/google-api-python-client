  <pre>Batch gets the update history of assets that overlap a time window.
For IAM_POLICY content, this API outputs history when the asset and its
attached IAM POLICY both exist. This can create gaps in the output history.
Otherwise, this API outputs history with asset in both non-delete or
deleted status.
If a specified asset does not exist, this API returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT
error.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. It can only be an
organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a project ID (such as
&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;)&quot;, or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;). (required)
  contentType: string, Optional. The content type.
  readTimeWindow_endTime: string, End time of the time window (inclusive). If not specified, the current
timestamp is used instead.
  assetNames: string, A list of the full names of the assets.
See: https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format
Example:

`//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1`.

The request becomes a no-op if the asset name list is empty, and the max
size of the asset name list is 100 in one request. (repeated)
  readTimeWindow_startTime: string, Start time of the time window (exclusive).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

              # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
              # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
              # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
              # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
              # custom role.
              #
              # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
              # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
              # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
              # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
              # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

    <code class="details" id="exportAssets">exportAssets(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage
location/BigQuery table. For Cloud Storage location destinations, the
output format is newline-delimited JSON. Each line represents a
google.cloud.asset.v1.Asset in the JSON format; for BigQuery table
destinations, the output table stores the fields in asset proto as columns.
This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API
, which allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of
at least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation
result. For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually
finishes within 5 minutes.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an
organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a project ID (such as
&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;),
or a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;). (required)
  body: object, The request body.

        # data collection and indexing, there is a volatile window during which
        # running the same query may get different results.
    &quot;outputConfig&quot;: { # Output configuration for export assets destination. # Required. Output configuration indicating where the results will be output to.
      &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # A BigQuery destination for exporting assets to. # Destination on BigQuery. The output table stores the fields in asset
          # proto as columns in BigQuery.
        &quot;table&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The BigQuery table to which the snapshot result should be
            # written. If this table does not exist, a new table with the given name

            # &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/compute.googleapis.com/Disk/0&quot; is
            # the first shard of output objects containing all

  policy bindings that specify a role containing &quot;storage.buckets.update&quot;

  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="searchAllResources">searchAllResources(scope, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, query=None, assetTypes=None, orderBy=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Searches all the resources within the given accessible scope (e.g., a
project, a folder or an organization). Callers should have
`cloud.assets.SearchAllResources` permission upon the requested scope,
otherwise the request will be rejected.

Args:
  scope: string, Required. A scope can be a project, a folder or an organization. The search is
limited to the resources within the `scope`.

The allowed values are:

* projects/{PROJECT_ID}
* projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER}
* folders/{FOLDER_NUMBER}
* organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (required)
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The page size for search result pagination. Page size is capped at 500 even
if a larger value is given. If set to zero, server will pick an appropriate
default. Returned results may be fewer than requested. When this happens,
there could be more results as long as `next_page_token` is returned.
  pageToken: string, Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call
to this method. `page_token` must be the value of `next_page_token` from
the previous response. The values of all other method parameters, must be
identical to those in the previous call.
  query: string, Optional. The query statement. An empty query can be specified to search all the
resources of certain `asset_types` within the given `scope`.

Examples:

* `name : &quot;Important&quot;` to find Cloud resources whose name contains
  &quot;Important&quot; as a word.
* `displayName : &quot;Impor*&quot;` to find Cloud resources whose display name
  contains &quot;Impor&quot; as a word prefix.
* `description : &quot;*por*&quot;` to find Cloud resources whose description
  contains &quot;por&quot; as a substring.
* `location : &quot;us-west*&quot;` to find Cloud resources whose location is
  prefixed with &quot;us-west&quot;.
* `labels : &quot;prod&quot;` to find Cloud resources whose labels contain &quot;prod&quot; as
  a key or value.
* `labels.env : &quot;prod&quot;` to find Cloud resources which have a label &quot;env&quot;
  and its value is &quot;prod&quot;.
* `labels.env : *` to find Cloud resources which have a label &quot;env&quot;.
* `&quot;Important&quot;` to find Cloud resources which contain &quot;Important&quot; as a word
  in any of the searchable fields.
* `&quot;Impor*&quot;` to find Cloud resources which contain &quot;Impor&quot; as a word prefix
  in any of the searchable fields.
* `&quot;*por*&quot;` to find Cloud resources which contain &quot;por&quot; as a substring in
  any of the searchable fields.
* `(&quot;Important&quot; AND location : (&quot;us-west1&quot; OR &quot;global&quot;))` to find Cloud
  resources which contain &quot;Important&quot; as a word in any of the searchable
  fields and are also located in the &quot;us-west1&quot; region or the &quot;global&quot;
  location.

See [how to construct a
query](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-resources#how_to_construct_a_query)
for more details.
  assetTypes: string, Optional. A list of asset types that this request searches for. If empty, it will
search all the [searchable asset
types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#searchable_asset_types). (repeated)
  orderBy: string, Optional. A comma separated list of fields specifying the sorting order of the
results. The default order is ascending. Add &quot; DESC&quot; after the field name
to indicate descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored.
Example: &quot;location DESC, name&quot;. Only string fields in the response are
sortable, including `name`, `displayName`, `description`, `location`. All
the other fields such as repeated fields (e.g., `networkTags`), map
fields (e.g., `labels`) and struct fields (e.g., `additionalAttributes`)
are not supported.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
