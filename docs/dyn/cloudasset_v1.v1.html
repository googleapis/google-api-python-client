<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchGetAssetsHistory">batchGetAssetsHistory(parent, contentType=None, readTimeWindow_endTime=None, readTimeWindow_startTime=None, assetNames=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Batch gets the update history of assets that overlap a time window.
For RESOURCE content, this API outputs history with asset in both
non-delete or deleted status.
For IAM_POLICY content, this API outputs history when the asset and its
attached IAM POLICY both exist. This can create gaps in the output history.
If a specified asset does not exist, this API returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT
error.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. It can only be an
organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a project ID (such as
&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;)&quot;, or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;). (required)
  contentType: string, Optional. The content type.
  readTimeWindow_endTime: string, End time of the time window (inclusive). If not specified, the current
timestamp is used instead.
  readTimeWindow_startTime: string, Start time of the time window (exclusive).
  assetNames: string, A list of the full names of the assets.
See: https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format
Example:

`//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1`.

The request becomes a no-op if the asset name list is empty, and the max
size of the asset name list is 100 in one request. (repeated)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

            &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
                # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
                # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
                # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
                # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
                # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
                # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
                #
                # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
                # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
                # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

                # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
                # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
                # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
                #   that includes conditions

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="searchAllIamPolicies">searchAllIamPolicies(scope, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, query=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Searches all the IAM policies within the given accessible scope (e.g., a
project, a folder or an organization). Callers should have
cloud.assets.SearchAllIamPolicies permission upon the requested scope,
otherwise the request will be rejected.

Args:
  scope: string, Required. A scope can be a project, a folder or an organization. The search is
limited to the IAM policies within the `scope`.

The allowed values are:

* projects/{PROJECT_ID}
* projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER}
* folders/{FOLDER_NUMBER}
* organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (required)
  pageToken: string, Optional. If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to
this method. `page_token` must be the value of `next_page_token` from the
previous response. The values of all other method parameters must be
identical to those in the previous call.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The page size for search result pagination. Page size is capped at 500 even
if a larger value is given. If set to zero, server will pick an appropriate
default. Returned results may be fewer than requested. When this happens,
there could be more results as long as `next_page_token` is returned.
  query: string, Optional. The query statement. An empty query can be specified to search all the IAM
policies within the given `scope`.

Examples:

* `policy : &quot;amy@gmail.com&quot;` to find Cloud IAM policy bindings that
  specify user &quot;amy@gmail.com&quot;.
* `policy : &quot;roles/compute.admin&quot;` to find Cloud IAM policy bindings that
  specify the Compute Admin role.
* `policy.role.permissions : &quot;storage.buckets.update&quot;` to find Cloud IAM
  policy bindings that specify a role containing &quot;storage.buckets.update&quot;
  permission.
* `resource : &quot;organizations/123&quot;` to find Cloud IAM policy bindings that
  are set on &quot;organizations/123&quot;.
* `(resource : (&quot;organizations/123&quot; OR &quot;folders/1234&quot;) AND policy : &quot;amy&quot;)`
  to find Cloud IAM policy bindings that are set on &quot;organizations/123&quot; or
  &quot;folders/1234&quot;, and also specify user &quot;amy&quot;.

See [how to construct a
query](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#how_to_construct_a_query)
for more details.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

            #
            # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
            # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
            # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
            # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
            # custom role.
            #
            # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
            # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
            # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
            # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
            # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
            # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

              # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
              # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
