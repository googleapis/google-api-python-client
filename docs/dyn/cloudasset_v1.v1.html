    <code class="details" id="batchGetAssetsHistory">batchGetAssetsHistory(parent, contentType=None, assetNames=None, readTimeWindow_startTime=None, readTimeWindow_endTime=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Batch gets the update history of assets that overlap a time window.
For RESOURCE content, this API outputs history with asset in both
non-delete or deleted status.
For IAM_POLICY content, this API outputs history when the asset and its
attached IAM POLICY both exist. This can create gaps in the output history.
If a specified asset does not exist, this API returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT
error.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. It can only be an
organization number (such as "organizations/123"), a project ID (such as
"projects/my-project-id")", or a project number (such as "projects/12345"). (required)
  contentType: string, Optional. The content type.
  assetNames: string, A list of the full names of the assets. For example:
`//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1`.
See [Resource
Names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name)
and [Resource Name
Format](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format)
for more info.

The request becomes a no-op if the asset name list is empty, and the max
size of the asset name list is 100 in one request. (repeated)
  readTimeWindow_startTime: string, Start time of the time window (exclusive).
  readTimeWindow_endTime: string, End time of the time window (inclusive). If not specified, the current
timestamp is used instead.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    <code class="details" id="exportAssets">exportAssets(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage
location. The output format is newline-delimited JSON.
This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API allowing you
to keep track of the export.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an
organization number (such as "organizations/123"), a project ID (such as
"projects/my-project-id"), or a project number (such as "projects/12345"),
or a folder number (such as "folders/123"). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Export asset request.
    "assetTypes": [ # A list of asset types of which to take a snapshot for. For example:
        # "compute.googleapis.com/Disk". If specified, only matching assets will be

        # for all supported asset types.
      "A String",
    ],

        # returned.

        # to. All results will be in newline delimited JSON format.
      "bigqueryDestination": { # A BigQuery destination. # Destination on BigQuery. The output table stores the fields in asset
          # proto as columns in BigQuery. The resource/iam_policy field is converted
          # to a record with each field to a column, except metadata to a single JSON
          # string.
        "table": "A String", # Required. The BigQuery table to which the snapshot result should be

        "force": True or False, # If the destination table already exists and this flag is `TRUE`, the

            # call returns an INVALID_ARGUMEMT error.
        "dataset": "A String", # Required. The BigQuery dataset in format
            # "projects/projectId/datasets/datasetId", to which the snapshot result
            # should be exported. If this dataset does not exist, the export call returns

            # contains assets for that type. &lt;shard number&gt; starts from 0. For example:

        # between the current time and the current time minus 35 days (inclusive).
        # If not specified, the current time will be used. Due to delays in resource
        # data collection and indexing, there is a volatile window during which

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
