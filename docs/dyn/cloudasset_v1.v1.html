<p class="firstline">Analyzes IAM policies asynchronously to answer which identities have what accesses on which resources, and writes the analysis results to a Google Cloud Storage or a BigQuery destination. For Cloud Storage destination, the output format is the JSON format that represents a AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse. This method implements the google.longrunning.Operation, which allows you to track the operation status. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential backoff retry to poll the operation result. The metadata contains the metadata for the long-running operation.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#analyzeMove">analyzeMove(resource, destinationParent=None, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Analyze moving a resource to a specified destination without kicking off the actual move. The analysis is best effort depending on the user's permissions of viewing different hierarchical policies and configurations. The policies and configuration are subject to change before the actual resource migration takes place.</p>

  <pre>Analyzes IAM policies to answer which identities have what accesses on which resources.

Args:
  scope: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within the scope will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;). To know how to get organization id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id). To know how to get folder or project id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders#viewing_or_listing_folders_and_projects). (required)
  analysisQuery_accessSelector_permissions: string, Optional. The permissions to appear in result. (repeated)
  analysisQuery_accessSelector_roles: string, Optional. The roles to appear in result. (repeated)
  analysisQuery_conditionContext_accessTime: string, The hypothetical access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions. Note that this value must not be earlier than the current time; otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.
  analysisQuery_identitySelector_identity: string, Required. The identity appear in the form of principals in [IAM policy binding](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Binding). The examples of supported forms are: &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot;. Notice that wildcard characters (such as * and ?) are not supported. You must give a specific identity.
  analysisQuery_options_analyzeServiceAccountImpersonation: boolean, Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning RPC instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Only the following permissions are considered in this analysis: * `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` * `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` * `iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt` * `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken` * `iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken` * `iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation` Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_expandGroups: boolean, Optional. If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. If true, the default max expansion per group is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][]. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_expandResources: boolean, Optional. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a Google Cloud folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resources cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource. If true, the default max expansion per resource is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][] and 100000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning][]. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_expandRoles: boolean, Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.access_selector is specified, the access section of the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_outputGroupEdges: boolean, Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant membership relationships between groups and other groups, and between groups and principals. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_outputResourceEdges: boolean, Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant parent/child relationships between resources. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_resourceSelector_fullResourceName: string, Required. The [full resource name] (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) of a resource of [supported resource types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#analyzable_asset_types).
  executionTimeout: string, Optional. Amount of time executable has to complete. See JSON representation of [Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json). If this field is set with a value less than the RPC deadline, and the execution of your query hasn&#x27;t finished in the specified execution timeout, you will get a response with partial result. Otherwise, your query&#x27;s execution will continue until the RPC deadline. If it&#x27;s not finished until then, you will get a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error. Default is empty.
  savedAnalysisQuery: string, Optional. The name of a saved query, which must be in the format of: * projects/project_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * folders/folder_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * organizations/organization_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id If both `analysis_query` and `saved_analysis_query` are provided, they will be merged together with the `saved_analysis_query` as base and the `analysis_query` as overrides. For more details of the merge behavior, please refer to the [MergeFrom](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/cpp/google.protobuf.message#Message.MergeFrom.details) page. Note that you cannot override primitive fields with default value, such as 0 or empty string, etc., because we use proto3, which doesn&#x27;t support field presence yet.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

    <code class="details" id="analyzeIamPolicyLongrunning">analyzeIamPolicyLongrunning(scope, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Analyzes IAM policies asynchronously to answer which identities have what accesses on which resources, and writes the analysis results to a Google Cloud Storage or a BigQuery destination. For Cloud Storage destination, the output format is the JSON format that represents a AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse. This method implements the google.longrunning.Operation, which allows you to track the operation status. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential backoff retry to poll the operation result. The metadata contains the metadata for the long-running operation.

Args:
  scope: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within the scope will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;). To know how to get organization id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id). To know how to get folder or project id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders#viewing_or_listing_folders_and_projects). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request message for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning.
  &quot;analysisQuery&quot;: { # IAM policy analysis query message. # Required. The request query.
    &quot;accessSelector&quot;: { # Specifies roles and/or permissions to analyze, to determine both the identities possessing them and the resources they control. If multiple values are specified, results will include roles or permissions matching any of them. The total number of roles and permissions should be equal or less than 10. # Optional. Specifies roles or permissions for analysis. This is optional.
      &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # Optional. The permissions to appear in result.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;roles&quot;: [ # Optional. The roles to appear in result.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
    },
    &quot;conditionContext&quot;: { # The IAM conditions context. # Optional. The hypothetical context for IAM conditions evaluation.
      &quot;accessTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The hypothetical access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions. Note that this value must not be earlier than the current time; otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.
    },
    &quot;identitySelector&quot;: { # Specifies an identity for which to determine resource access, based on roles assigned either directly to them or to the groups they belong to, directly or indirectly. # Optional. Specifies an identity for analysis.
      &quot;identity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The identity appear in the form of principals in [IAM policy binding](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Binding). The examples of supported forms are: &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot;. Notice that wildcard characters (such as * and ?) are not supported. You must give a specific identity.
    },
    &quot;options&quot;: { # Contains query options. # Optional. The query options.
      &quot;analyzeServiceAccountImpersonation&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning RPC instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Only the following permissions are considered in this analysis: * `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` * `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` * `iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt` * `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken` * `iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken` * `iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation` Default is false.
      &quot;expandGroups&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. If true, the default max expansion per group is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][]. Default is false.
      &quot;expandResources&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a Google Cloud folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resources cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource. If true, the default max expansion per resource is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][] and 100000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning][]. Default is false.
      &quot;expandRoles&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.access_selector is specified, the access section of the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. Default is false.
      &quot;outputGroupEdges&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant membership relationships between groups and other groups, and between groups and principals. Default is false.
      &quot;outputResourceEdges&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant parent/child relationships between resources. Default is false.
    },
    &quot;resourceSelector&quot;: { # Specifies the resource to analyze for access policies, which may be set directly on the resource, or on ancestors such as organizations, folders or projects. # Optional. Specifies a resource for analysis.
      &quot;fullResourceName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The [full resource name] (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) of a resource of [supported resource types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#analyzable_asset_types).
    },
    &quot;scope&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within the scope will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;).

  &quot;outputConfig&quot;: { # Output configuration for export IAM policy analysis destination. # Required. Output configuration indicating where the results will be output to.
    &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # A BigQuery destination. # Destination on BigQuery.
      &quot;dataset&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The BigQuery dataset in format &quot;projects/projectId/datasets/datasetId&quot;, to which the analysis results should be exported. If this dataset does not exist, the export call will return an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
      &quot;partitionKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The partition key for BigQuery partitioned table.
      &quot;tablePrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The prefix of the BigQuery tables to which the analysis results will be written. Tables will be created based on this table_prefix if not exist: * _analysis table will contain export operation&#x27;s metadata. * _analysis_result will contain all the IamPolicyAnalysisResult. When [partition_key] is specified, both tables will be partitioned based on the [partition_key].
      &quot;writeDisposition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table or partition already exists. The following values are supported: * WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table or partition already exists, BigQuery overwrites the entire table or all the partitions data. * WRITE_APPEND: If the table or partition already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table or the latest partition. * WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, an error is returned. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Details are at https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-local#appending_to_or_overwriting_a_table_using_a_local_file.

If the specified Cloud Storage object already exists and there is no [hold](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-holds), it will be overwritten with the analysis result.
    },
  },
  &quot;savedAnalysisQuery&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of a saved query, which must be in the format of: * projects/project_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * folders/folder_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id * organizations/organization_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id If both `analysis_query` and `saved_analysis_query` are provided, they will be merged together with the `saved_analysis_query` as base and the `analysis_query` as overrides. For more details of the merge behavior, please refer to the [MergeFrom](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/cpp/google.protobuf.message#Message.MergeFrom.details) doc. Note that you cannot override primitive fields with default value, such as 0 or empty string, etc., because we use proto3, which doesn&#x27;t support field presence yet.

Args:
  scope: string, Required. The organization to scope the request. Only organization policies within the scope will be analyzed. The output assets will also be limited to the ones governed by those in-scope organization policies. * organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (e.g., &quot;organizations/123456&quot;) (required)
  constraint: string, Required. The name of the constraint to analyze governed assets for. The analysis only contains analyzed organization policies for the provided constraint.
  filter: string, The expression to filter the governed assets in result. The only supported fields for governed resources are `governed_resource.project` and `governed_resource.folders`. The only supported fields for governed iam policies are `governed_iam_policy.project` and `governed_iam_policy.folders`. The only supported operator is `=`. Example 1: governed_resource.project=&quot;projects/12345678&quot; filter will return all governed resources under projects/12345678 including the project ifself, if applicable. Example 2: governed_iam_policy.folders=&quot;folders/12345678&quot; filter will return all governed iam policies under folders/12345678, if applicable.

This can create gaps in the output history. Otherwise, this API outputs history with asset in both non-delete or deleted status. If a specified asset does not exist, this API returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. It can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;)&quot;, or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;). (required)
  assetNames: string, A list of the full names of the assets. See: https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format Example: `//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1`. The request becomes a no-op if the asset name list is empty, and the max size of the asset name list is 100 in one request. (repeated)
  contentType: string, Optional. The content type.
    Allowed values
      CONTENT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED - Unspecified content type.
      RESOURCE - Resource metadata.
      IAM_POLICY - The actual IAM policy set on a resource.

      ACCESS_POLICY - The Access Context Manager policy set on an asset.
      OS_INVENTORY - The runtime OS Inventory information.
      RELATIONSHIP - The related resources.
  readTimeWindow_endTime: string, End time of the time window (inclusive). If not specified, the current timestamp is used instead.
  readTimeWindow_startTime: string, Start time of the time window (exclusive).
  relationshipTypes: string, Optional. A list of relationship types to output, for example: `INSTANCE_TO_INSTANCEGROUP`. This field should only be specified if content_type=RELATIONSHIP. * If specified: it outputs specified relationships&#x27; history on the [asset_names]. It returns an error if any of the [relationship_types] doesn&#x27;t belong to the supported relationship types of the [asset_names] or if any of the [asset_names]&#x27;s types doesn&#x27;t belong to the source types of the [relationship_types]. * Otherwise: it outputs the supported relationships&#x27; history on the [asset_names] or returns an error if any of the [asset_names]&#x27;s types has no relationship support. See [Introduction to Cloud Asset Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/overview) for all supported asset types and relationship types. (repeated)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

            &quot;booleanPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `boolean_policy` will behave at this resource. # For boolean `Constraints`, whether to enforce the `Constraint` or not.
              &quot;enforced&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, then the `Policy` is enforced. If `false`, then any configuration is acceptable. Suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced. Example 3 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.

When the `Policy` is returned from either a `GetPolicy` or a `ListOrgPolicy` request, this `etag` indicates the version of the current `Policy` to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset. When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the `etag`in a `SetOrgPolicy` request will result in an unconditional write of the `Policy`.
            &quot;listPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - &quot;projects/&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot; - &quot;folders/&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot; - &quot;organizations/&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot; The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset. # List of values either allowed or disallowed.

              &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`. By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.

A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced. Example 3 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.
            },
            &quot;constraint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the `Constraint` the `Policy` is configuring, for example, `constraints/serviceuser.services`. A [list of available constraints](/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) is available. Immutable after creation.
            &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An opaque tag indicating the current version of the `Policy`, used for concurrency control. When the `Policy` is returned from either a `GetPolicy` or a `ListOrgPolicy` request, this `etag` indicates the version of the current `Policy` to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset. When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the `etag`in a `SetOrgPolicy` request will result in an unconditional write of the `Policy`.
            &quot;listPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - &quot;projects/&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot; - &quot;folders/&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot; - &quot;organizations/&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot; The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset. # List of values either allowed or disallowed.
              &quot;allValues&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The policy all_values state.

              &quot;deniedValues&quot;: [ # List of values denied at this resource. Can only be set if `all_values` is set to `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`.
                &quot;A String&quot;,
              ],
              &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`. By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.

They could then set a `Policy` with the `policy_type` `restore_default` on several experimental projects, restoring the `constraint_default` enforcement of the `Constraint` for only those projects, allowing those projects to have all services activated. # Restores the default behavior of the constraint; independent of `Constraint` type.

  <pre>Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage location/BigQuery table. For Cloud Storage location destinations, the output format is newline-delimited JSON. Each line represents a google.cloud.asset.v1.Asset in the JSON format; for BigQuery table destinations, the output table stores the fields in asset Protobuf as columns. This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API, which allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation result. For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually finishes within 5 minutes.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;), or a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Export asset request.
  &quot;assetTypes&quot;: [ # A list of asset types to take a snapshot for. For example: &quot;compute.googleapis.com/Disk&quot;. Regular expressions are also supported. For example: * &quot;compute.googleapis.com.*&quot; snapshots resources whose asset type starts with &quot;compute.googleapis.com&quot;. * &quot;.*Instance&quot; snapshots resources whose asset type ends with &quot;Instance&quot;. * &quot;.*Instance.*&quot; snapshots resources whose asset type contains &quot;Instance&quot;. See [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all supported regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned. If specified, only matching assets will be returned, otherwise, it will snapshot all asset types. See [Introduction to Cloud Asset Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/overview) for all supported asset types.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name will be returned.
  &quot;outputConfig&quot;: { # Output configuration for export assets destination. # Required. Output configuration indicating where the results will be output to.
    &quot;bigqueryDestination&quot;: { # A BigQuery destination for exporting assets to. # Destination on BigQuery. The output table stores the fields in asset Protobuf as columns in BigQuery.
      &quot;dataset&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The BigQuery dataset in format &quot;projects/projectId/datasets/datasetId&quot;, to which the snapshot result should be exported. If this dataset does not exist, the export call returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error. Setting the `contentType` for `exportAssets` determines the [schema](/asset-inventory/docs/exporting-to-bigquery#bigquery-schema) of the BigQuery table. Setting `separateTablesPerAssetType` to `TRUE` also influences the schema.
      &quot;force&quot;: True or False, # If the destination table already exists and this flag is `TRUE`, the table will be overwritten by the contents of assets snapshot. If the flag is `FALSE` or unset and the destination table already exists, the export call returns an INVALID_ARGUMEMT error.
      &quot;partitionSpec&quot;: { # Specifications of BigQuery partitioned table as export destination. # [partition_spec] determines whether to export to partitioned table(s) and how to partition the data. If [partition_spec] is unset or [partition_spec.partition_key] is unset or `PARTITION_KEY_UNSPECIFIED`, the snapshot results will be exported to non-partitioned table(s). [force] will decide whether to overwrite existing table(s). If [partition_spec] is specified. First, the snapshot results will be written to partitioned table(s) with two additional timestamp columns, readTime and requestTime, one of which will be the partition key. Secondly, in the case when any destination table already exists, it will first try to update existing table&#x27;s schema as necessary by appending additional columns. Then, if [force] is `TRUE`, the corresponding partition will be overwritten by the snapshot results (data in different partitions will remain intact); if [force] is unset or `FALSE`, it will append the data. An error will be returned if the schema update or data appension fails.
        &quot;partitionKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The partition key for BigQuery partitioned table.
      },
      &quot;separateTablesPerAssetType&quot;: True or False, # If this flag is `TRUE`, the snapshot results will be written to one or multiple tables, each of which contains results of one asset type. The [force] and [partition_spec] fields will apply to each of them. Field [table] will be concatenated with &quot;_&quot; and the asset type names (see https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types for supported asset types) to construct per-asset-type table names, in which all non-alphanumeric characters like &quot;.&quot; and &quot;/&quot; will be substituted by &quot;_&quot;. Example: if field [table] is &quot;mytable&quot; and snapshot results contain &quot;storage.googleapis.com/Bucket&quot; assets, the corresponding table name will be &quot;mytable_storage_googleapis_com_Bucket&quot;. If any of these tables does not exist, a new table with the concatenated name will be created. When [content_type] in the ExportAssetsRequest is `RESOURCE`, the schema of each table will include RECORD-type columns mapped to the nested fields in the Asset.resource.data field of that asset type (up to the 15 nested level BigQuery supports (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#limitations)). The fields in &gt;15 nested levels will be stored in JSON format string as a child column of its parent RECORD column. If error occurs when exporting to any table, the whole export call will return an error but the export results that already succeed will persist. Example: if exporting to table_type_A succeeds when exporting to table_type_B fails during one export call, the results in table_type_A will persist and there will not be partial results persisting in a table.
      &quot;table&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The BigQuery table to which the snapshot result should be written. If this table does not exist, a new table with the given name will be created.
    },
    &quot;gcsDestination&quot;: { # A Cloud Storage location. # Destination on Cloud Storage.
      &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URI of the Cloud Storage object. It&#x27;s the same URI that is used by gsutil. Example: &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name&quot;. See [Viewing and Editing Object Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/viewing-editing-metadata) for more information. If the specified Cloud Storage object already exists and there is no [hold](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-holds), it will be overwritten with the exported result.
      &quot;uriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URI prefix of all generated Cloud Storage objects. Example: &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix&quot;. Each object URI is in format: &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix// and only contains assets for that type. starts from 0. Example: &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/compute.googleapis.com/Disk/0&quot; is the first shard of output objects containing all compute.googleapis.com/Disk assets. An INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned if file with the same name &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix&quot; already exists.
    },

If the query execution finishes within timeout and there&#x27;s no pagination, the full query results will be returned in the `QueryAssetsResponse`. Otherwise, full query results can be obtained by issuing extra requests with the `job_reference` from the a previous `QueryAssets` call.

Args:
  scope: string, Required. A scope can be a project, a folder, or an organization. The search is limited to the IAM policies within the `scope`. The caller must be granted the [`cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies`](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/access-control#required_permissions) permission on the desired scope. The allowed values are: * projects/{PROJECT_ID} (e.g., &quot;projects/foo-bar&quot;) * projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER} (e.g., &quot;projects/12345678&quot;) * folders/{FOLDER_NUMBER} (e.g., &quot;folders/1234567&quot;) * organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (e.g., &quot;organizations/123456&quot;) (required)
  assetTypes: string, Optional. A list of asset types that the IAM policies are attached to. If empty, it will search the IAM policies that are attached to all the [searchable asset types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#searchable_asset_types). Regular expressions are also supported. For example: * &quot;compute.googleapis.com.*&quot; snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type starts with &quot;compute.googleapis.com&quot;. * &quot;.*Instance&quot; snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type ends with &quot;Instance&quot;. * &quot;.*Instance.*&quot; snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type contains &quot;Instance&quot;. See [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all supported regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned. (repeated)
  orderBy: string, Optional. A comma-separated list of fields specifying the sorting order of the results. The default order is ascending. Add &quot; DESC&quot; after the field name to indicate descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored. Example: &quot;assetType DESC, resource&quot;. Only singular primitive fields in the response are sortable: * resource * assetType * project All the other fields such as repeated fields (e.g., `folders`) and non-primitive fields (e.g., `policy`) are not supported.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The page size for search result pagination. Page size is capped at 500 even if a larger value is given. If set to zero, server will pick an appropriate default. Returned results may be fewer than requested. When this happens, there could be more results as long as `next_page_token` is returned.
  pageToken: string, Optional. If present, retrieve the next batch of results from the preceding call to this method. `page_token` must be the value of `next_page_token` from the previous response. The values of all other method parameters must be identical to those in the previous call.
  query: string, Optional. The query statement. See [how to construct a query](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#how_to_construct_a_query) for more information. If not specified or empty, it will search all the IAM policies within the specified `scope`. Note that the query string is compared against each IAM policy binding, including its principals, roles, and IAM conditions. The returned IAM policies will only contain the bindings that match your query. To learn more about the IAM policy structure, see the [IAM policy documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/allow-policies/structure). Examples: * `policy:amy@gmail.com` to find IAM policy bindings that specify user &quot;amy@gmail.com&quot;. * `policy:roles/compute.admin` to find IAM policy bindings that specify the Compute Admin role. * `policy:comp*` to find IAM policy bindings that contain &quot;comp&quot; as a prefix of any word in the binding. * `policy.role.permissions:storage.buckets.update` to find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing &quot;storage.buckets.update&quot; permission. Note that if callers don&#x27;t have `iam.roles.get` access to a role&#x27;s included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results. * `policy.role.permissions:upd*` to find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing &quot;upd&quot; as a prefix of any word in the role permission. Note that if callers don&#x27;t have `iam.roles.get` access to a role&#x27;s included permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search results. * `resource:organizations/123456` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on &quot;organizations/123456&quot;. * `resource=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/myproject` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on the project named &quot;myproject&quot;. * `Important` to find IAM policy bindings that contain &quot;Important&quot; as a word in any of the searchable fields (except for the included permissions). * `resource:(instance1 OR instance2) policy:amy` to find IAM policy bindings that are set on resources &quot;instance1&quot; or &quot;instance2&quot; and also specify user &quot;amy&quot;. * `roles:roles/compute.admin` to find IAM policy bindings that specify the Compute Admin role. * `memberTypes:user` to find IAM policy bindings that contain the principal type &quot;user&quot;.

      &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # The IAM policy directly set on the given resource. Note that the original IAM policy can contain multiple bindings. This only contains the bindings that match the given query. For queries that don&#x27;t contain a constrain on policies (e.g., an empty query), this contains all the bindings. To search against the `policy` bindings: * use a field query: - query by the policy contained members. Example: `policy:amy@gmail.com` - query by the policy contained roles.
