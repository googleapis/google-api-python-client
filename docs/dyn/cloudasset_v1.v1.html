<p class="firstline">Analyzes IAM policies asynchronously to answer which identities have what accesses on which resources, and writes the analysis results to a Google Cloud Storage or a BigQuery destination. For Cloud Storage destination, the output format is the JSON format that represents a AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse. This method implements the google.longrunning.Operation, which allows you to track the operation status. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential backoff retry to poll the operation result. The metadata contains the request to help callers to map responses to requests.</p>

<p class="firstline">Batch gets the update history of assets that overlap a time window. For IAM_POLICY content, this API outputs history when the asset and its attached IAM POLICY both exist. This can create gaps in the output history. Otherwise, this API outputs history with asset in both non-delete or deleted status. If a specified asset does not exist, this API returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.</p>

  <pre>Analyzes IAM policies to answer which identities have what accesses on which resources.

Args:
  scope: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within the scope will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;). To know how to get organization id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id). To know how to get folder or project id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders#viewing_or_listing_folders_and_projects). (required)
  analysisQuery_accessSelector_permissions: string, Optional. The permissions to appear in result. (repeated)
  analysisQuery_accessSelector_roles: string, Optional. The roles to appear in result. (repeated)
  analysisQuery_conditionContext_accessTime: string, The hypothetical access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions. Note that this value must not be earlier than the current time; otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.
  analysisQuery_identitySelector_identity: string, Required. The identity appear in the form of members in [IAM policy binding](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Binding). The examples of supported forms are: &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot;. Notice that wildcard characters (such as * and ?) are not supported. You must give a specific identity.
  analysisQuery_options_analyzeServiceAccountImpersonation: boolean, Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning rpc instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a GCP folder F, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_expandGroups: boolean, Optional. If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_expandResources: boolean, Optional. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a GCP folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resource cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a GCP project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_expandRoles: boolean, Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.access_selector is specified, the access section of the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_outputGroupEdges: boolean, Optional. If true, the result will output group identity edges, starting from the binding&#x27;s group members, to any expanded identities. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_options_outputResourceEdges: boolean, Optional. If true, the result will output resource edges, starting from the policy attached resource, to any expanded resources. Default is false.
  analysisQuery_resourceSelector_fullResourceName: string, Required. The [full resource name] (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) of a resource of [supported resource types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#analyzable_asset_types).
  executionTimeout: string, Optional. Amount of time executable has to complete. See JSON representation of [Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json). If this field is set with a value less than the RPC deadline, and the execution of your query hasn&#x27;t finished in the specified execution timeout, you will get a response with partial result. Otherwise, your query&#x27;s execution will continue until the RPC deadline. If it&#x27;s not finished until then, you will get a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error. Default is empty.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a GCP folder F, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder F.

For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a GCP folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resource cannot be used together with this option.

  <pre>Analyzes IAM policies asynchronously to answer which identities have what accesses on which resources, and writes the analysis results to a Google Cloud Storage or a BigQuery destination. For Cloud Storage destination, the output format is the JSON format that represents a AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse. This method implements the google.longrunning.Operation, which allows you to track the operation status. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential backoff retry to poll the operation result. The metadata contains the request to help callers to map responses to requests.

This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning rpc instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a GCP folder F, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the GCP folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Default is false.
      &quot;expandGroups&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. Default is false.
      &quot;expandResources&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a GCP folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resource cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a GCP project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource. Default is false.
      &quot;expandRoles&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.access_selector is specified, the access section of the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. Default is false.
      &quot;outputGroupEdges&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the result will output group identity edges, starting from the binding&#x27;s group members, to any expanded identities. Default is false.
      &quot;outputResourceEdges&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the result will output resource edges, starting from the policy attached resource, to any expanded resources. Default is false.

      &quot;tablePrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The prefix of the BigQuery tables to which the analysis results will be written. Tables will be created based on this table_prefix if not exist: * _analysis table will contain export operation&#x27;s metadata. * _analysis_result will contain all the IamPolicyAnalysisResult. When [partition_key] is specified, both tables will be partitioned based on the [partition_key].
      &quot;writeDisposition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table or partition already exists. The following values are supported: * WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table or partition already exists, BigQuery overwrites the entire table or all the partitions data. * WRITE_APPEND: If the table or partition already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table or the latest partition. * WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, an error is returned. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully.

              &quot;enforced&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, then the `Policy` is enforced. If `false`, then any configuration is acceptable. Suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy, serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement gets replaced): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is enforced. Example 3 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.

When the `Policy` is returned from either a `GetPolicy` or a `ListOrgPolicy` request, this `etag` indicates the version of the current `Policy` to use when executing a read-modify-write loop. When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset. When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control. Not setting the `etag`in a `SetOrgPolicy` request will result in an unconditional write of the `Policy`.
            &quot;listPolicy&quot;: { # Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the following formats: - &quot;projects/&quot;, e.g. &quot;projects/tokyo-rain-123&quot; - &quot;folders/&quot;, e.g. &quot;folders/1234&quot; - &quot;organizations/&quot;, e.g. &quot;organizations/1234&quot; The `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset. # List of values either allowed or disallowed.

              &quot;inheritFromParent&quot;: True or False, # Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`. By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1-&gt;{F1, F2}; F1-&gt;{P1}; F2-&gt;{P2, P3}, `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;under:organizations/O1&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: &quot;under:projects/P3&quot;} {denied_values: &quot;under:folders/F2&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`, `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `projects/P1`.

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

When the `Policy` is returned from a `GetEffectivePolicy` request, the `etag` will be unset. When the `Policy` is used in a `SetOrgPolicy` method, use the `etag` value that was returned from a `GetOrgPolicy` request as part of a read-modify-write loop for concurrency control.

This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required only if the value contains a &quot;:&quot;. Values prefixed with &quot;is:&quot; are treated the same as values with no prefix.

By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn&#x27;t recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: &quot;E3&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E4&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {value: &quot;E3&quot; value: &quot;E4&quot; inherit_from_parent: true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: &quot;E1&quot;} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values:&quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: &quot;E1&quot; allowed_values: &quot;E2&quot;} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects/bar`.

  <pre>Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage location/BigQuery table. For Cloud Storage location destinations, the output format is newline-delimited JSON. Each line represents a google.cloud.asset.v1.Asset in the JSON format; for BigQuery table destinations, the output table stores the fields in asset proto as columns. This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API , which allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation result. For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually finishes within 5 minutes.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;), or a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Export asset request.
  &quot;assetTypes&quot;: [ # A list of asset types to take a snapshot for. For example: &quot;compute.googleapis.com/Disk&quot;. Regular expressions are also supported. For example: * &quot;compute.googleapis.com.*&quot; snapshots resources whose asset type starts with &quot;compute.googleapis.com&quot;. * &quot;.*Instance&quot; snapshots resources whose asset type ends with &quot;Instance&quot;. * &quot;.*Instance.*&quot; snapshots resources whose asset type contains &quot;Instance&quot;. See [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all supported regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned. If specified, only matching assets will be returned, otherwise, it will snapshot all asset types. See [Introduction to Cloud Asset Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/overview) for all supported asset types.

Field [table] will be concatenated with &quot;_&quot; and the asset type names (see https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types for supported asset types) to construct per-asset-type table names, in which all non-alphanumeric characters like &quot;.&quot; and &quot;/&quot; will be substituted by &quot;_&quot;. Example: if field [table] is &quot;mytable&quot; and snapshot results contain &quot;storage.googleapis.com/Bucket&quot; assets, the corresponding table name will be &quot;mytable_storage_googleapis_com_Bucket&quot;. If any of these tables does not exist, a new table with the concatenated name will be created. When [content_type] in the ExportAssetsRequest is `RESOURCE`, the schema of each table will include RECORD-type columns mapped to the nested fields in the Asset.resource.data field of that asset type (up to the 15 nested level BigQuery supports (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#limitations)). The fields in &gt;15 nested levels will be stored in JSON format string as a child column of its parent RECORD column. If error occurs when exporting to any table, the whole export call will return an error but the export results that already succeed will persist. Example: if exporting to table_type_A succeeds when exporting to table_type_B fails during one export call, the results in table_type_A will persist and there will not be partial results persisting in a table.

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

For queries that don&#x27;t contain a constrain on policies (e.g., an empty query), this contains all the bindings. To search against the `policy` bindings: * use a field query: - query by the policy contained members. Example: `policy:amy@gmail.com` - query by the policy contained roles.
