  <pre>Creates a new policy orchestrator under the given organizations resource. `name` field of the given orchestrator are ignored and instead replaced by a product of `parent` and `policy_orchestrator_id`. Orchestrator state field might be only set to `ACTIVE`, `STOPPED` or omitted (in which case, the created resource will be in `ACTIVE` state anyway).

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource name in the form of: * `organizations/{organization_id}/locations/global` * `folders/{folder_id}/locations/global` * `projects/{project_id_or_number}/locations/global` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # PolicyOrchestrator helps managing project+zone level policy resources (e.g. OS Policy Assignments), by providing tools to create, update and delete them across projects and locations, at scale. Policy orchestrator functions as an endless loop. Each iteration orchestrator computes a set of resources that should be affected, then progressively applies changes to them. If for some reason this set of resources changes over time (e.g. new projects are added), the future loop iterations will address that. Orchestrator can either upsert or delete policy resources. For more details, see the description of the `action`, and `orchestrated_resource` fields. Note that policy orchestrator do not &quot;manage&quot; the resources it creates. Every iteration is independent and only minimal history of past actions is retained (apart from Cloud Logging). If orchestrator gets deleted, it does not affect the resources it created in the past. Those will remain where they were. Same applies if projects are removed from the orchestrator&#x27;s scope.

The `validate` stage can signal that the `ExecResource` is already in the desired state by returning an exit code of `100`. If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state, it should return an exit code of `101`. Any other exit code returned by this stage is considered an error.

If the `ExecResource` is already in the desired state, the `enforce` stage will not be run. Similar to `validate` stage, the `enforce` stage should return an exit code of `100` to indicate that the resource in now in its desired state. Any other exit code is considered an error. NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen over `0` (and `101` vs `1`) to have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in desired state` and errors. Because, for example, Powershell will always return an exit code of `0` unless an `exit` statement is provided in the script.

  policyOrchestratorId: string, Required.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, etag=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes an existing policy orchestrator resource, parented by an organization.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the resource to be deleted. (required)
  etag: string, Optional. The current etag of the policy orchestrator. If an etag is provided and does not match the current etag of the policy orchestrator, deletion will be blocked and an ABORTED error will be returned.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the policy orchestrators under the given parent organization resource.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource name. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Filtering results
  orderBy: string, Optional. Hint for how to order the results
  pageSize: integer, Optional. Requested page size. Server may return fewer items than requested. If unspecified, server will pick an appropriate default.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A token identifying a page of results the server should return.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response for the list policy orchestrator resources.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A token, which can be sent as `page_token` to retrieve the next page. If this field is omitted, there are no subsequent pages.
  &quot;policyOrchestrators&quot;: [ # The policy orchestrators for the specified parent resource.
    { # PolicyOrchestrator helps managing project+zone level policy resources (e.g. OS Policy Assignments), by providing tools to create, update and delete them across projects and locations, at scale. Policy orchestrator functions as an endless loop. Each iteration orchestrator computes a set of resources that should be affected, then progressively applies changes to them. If for some reason this set of resources changes over time (e.g. new projects are added), the future loop iterations will address that. Orchestrator can either upsert or delete policy resources. For more details, see the description of the `action`, and `orchestrated_resource` fields. Note that policy orchestrator do not &quot;manage&quot; the resources it creates. Every iteration is independent and only minimal history of past actions is retained (apart from Cloud Logging). If orchestrator gets deleted, it does not affect the resources it created in the past. Those will remain where they were. Same applies if projects are removed from the orchestrator&#x27;s scope.
      &quot;action&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Action to be done by the orchestrator in `projects/{project_id}/zones/{zone_id}` locations defined by the `orchestration_scope`. Allowed values: - `UPSERT` - Orchestrator will create or update target resources. - `DELETE` - Orchestrator will delete target resources, if they exist
      &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when the policy orchestrator resource was created.
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Freeform text describing the purpose of the resource.
      &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
      &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels as key value pairs

    The object takes the form of:

{ # PolicyOrchestrator helps managing project+zone level policy resources (e.g. OS Policy Assignments), by providing tools to create, update and delete them across projects and locations, at scale. Policy orchestrator functions as an endless loop. Each iteration orchestrator computes a set of resources that should be affected, then progressively applies changes to them. If for some reason this set of resources changes over time (e.g. new projects are added), the future loop iterations will address that. Orchestrator can either upsert or delete policy resources. For more details, see the description of the `action`, and `orchestrated_resource` fields. Note that policy orchestrator do not &quot;manage&quot; the resources it creates. Every iteration is independent and only minimal history of past actions is retained (apart from Cloud Logging). If orchestrator gets deleted, it does not affect the resources it created in the past. Those will remain where they were. Same applies if projects are removed from the orchestrator&#x27;s scope.
  &quot;action&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Action to be done by the orchestrator in `projects/{project_id}/zones/{zone_id}` locations defined by the `orchestration_scope`.

  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Freeform text describing the purpose of the resource.
