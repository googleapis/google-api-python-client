<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="purge">purge(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Asynchronous API to delete all Products in a ProductSet or all Products
that are in no ProductSet.

If a Product is a member of the specified ProductSet in addition to other
ProductSets, the Product will still be deleted.

It is recommended to not delete the specified ProductSet until after this
operation has completed. It is also recommended to not add any of the
Products involved in the batch delete to a new ProductSet while this
operation is running because those Products may still end up deleted.

It's not possible to undo the PurgeProducts operation. Therefore, it is
recommended to keep the csv files used in ImportProductSets (if that was
how you originally built the Product Set) before starting PurgeProducts, in
case you need to re-import the data after deletion.

If the plan is to purge all of the Products from a ProductSet and then
re-use the empty ProductSet to re-import new Products into the empty
ProductSet, you must wait until the PurgeProducts operation has finished
for that ProductSet.

The google.longrunning.Operation API can be used to keep track of the
progress and results of the request.
`Operation.metadata` contains `BatchOperationMetadata`. (progress)

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project and location in which the Products should be deleted.

Format is `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the `PurgeProducts` method.
    "deleteOrphanProducts": True or False, # If delete_orphan_products is true, all Products that are not in any
        # ProductSet will be deleted.
    "productSetPurgeConfig": { # Config to control which ProductSet contains the Products to be deleted. # Specify which ProductSet contains the Products to be deleted.
      "productSetId": "A String", # The ProductSet that contains the Products to delete. If a Product is a
          # member of product_set_id in addition to other ProductSets, the Product will
          # still be deleted.
    },
    "force": True or False, # The default value is false. Override this value to true to actually perform
        # the purge.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
