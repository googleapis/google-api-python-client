Args:
  parent: string, Required. The flow to create a page for. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described and visualized as a state machine. The states of a CX session are represented by pages. For each flow, you define many pages, where your combined pages can handle a complete conversation on the topics the flow is designed for. At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational state represented by the page. For more information, see the [Page guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/page).
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human-readable name of the page, unique within the flow.
  &quot;entryFulfillment&quot;: { # A fulfillment can do one or more of the following actions at the same time: * Generate rich message responses. * Set parameter values. * Call the webhook. Fulfillments can be called at various stages in the Page or Form lifecycle. For example, when a DetectIntentRequest drives a session to enter a new page, the page&#x27;s entry fulfillment can add a static response to the QueryResult in the returning DetectIntentResponse, call the webhook (for example, to load user data from a database), or both. # The fulfillment to call when the session is entering the page.
    &quot;conditionalCases&quot;: [ # Conditional cases for this fulfillment.
      { # A list of cascading if-else conditions. Cases are mutually exclusive. The first one with a matching condition is selected, all the rest ignored.
        &quot;cases&quot;: [ # A list of cascading if-else conditions.

            &quot;caseContent&quot;: [ # A list of case content.
              { # The list of messages or conditional cases to activate for this case.
                &quot;additionalCases&quot;: # Object with schema name: GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3FulfillmentConditionalCases # Additional cases to be evaluated.
                &quot;message&quot;: { # Represents a response message that can be returned by a conversational agent. Response messages are also used for output audio synthesis. The approach is as follows: * If at least one OutputAudioText response is present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated as either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. * Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis. This approach allows for more sophisticated user experience scenarios, where the text displayed to the user may differ from what is heard. # Returned message.

Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don&#x27;t return ConversationSuccess. You may set this, for example: * In the entry_fulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded. * In a webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer issue. # Indicates that the conversation succeeded.

For each flow, you define many pages, where your combined pages can handle a complete conversation on the topics the flow is designed for. At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational state represented by the page.

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body=None, languageCode=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the specified page. Note: You should always train a flow prior to sending it queries. See the [training documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/training).

Args:
  name: string, The unique identifier of the page. Required for the Pages.UpdatePage method. Pages.CreatePage populates the name automatically. Format: `projects//locations//agents//flows//pages/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described and visualized as a state machine. The states of a CX session are represented by pages. For each flow, you define many pages, where your combined pages can handle a complete conversation on the topics the flow is designed for. At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational state represented by the page. For more information, see the [Page guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/page).

Fulfillments can be called at various stages in the Page or Form lifecycle. For example, when a DetectIntentRequest drives a session to enter a new page, the page&#x27;s entry fulfillment can add a static response to the QueryResult in the returning DetectIntentResponse, call the webhook (for example, to load user data from a database), or both. # The fulfillment to call when the session is entering the page.

For each flow, you define many pages, where your combined pages can handle a complete conversation on the topics the flow is designed for. At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational state represented by the page.
