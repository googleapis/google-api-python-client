  <pre>Create an interactive session asynchronously.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource where this session will be created. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A representation of a session.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the session was created.
  &quot;creator&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The email address of the user who created the session.
  &quot;environmentConfig&quot;: { # Environment configuration for a workload. # Optional. Environment configuration for the session execution.
    &quot;executionConfig&quot;: { # Execution configuration for a workload. # Optional. Execution configuration for a workload.
      &quot;idleTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Applies to sessions only. The duration to keep the session alive while it&#x27;s idling. Exceeding this threshold causes the session to terminate. This field cannot be set on a batch workload. Minimum value is 10 minutes; maximum value is 14 days (see JSON representation of Duration (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)). Defaults to 1 hour if not set. If both ttl and idle_ttl are specified for an interactive session, the conditions are treated as OR conditions: the workload will be terminated when it has been idle for idle_ttl or when ttl has been exceeded, whichever occurs first.
      &quot;kmsKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The Cloud KMS key to use for encryption.
      &quot;networkTags&quot;: [ # Optional. Tags used for network traffic control.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;networkUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Network URI to connect workload to.

      &quot;stagingBucket&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A Cloud Storage bucket used to stage workload dependencies, config files, and store workload output and other ephemeral data, such as Spark history files. If you do not specify a staging bucket, Cloud Dataproc will determine a Cloud Storage location according to the region where your workload is running, and then create and manage project-level, per-location staging and temporary buckets. This field requires a Cloud Storage bucket name, not a gs://... URI to a Cloud Storage bucket.
      &quot;subnetworkUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Subnetwork URI to connect workload to.
      &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The duration after which the workload will be terminated, specified as the JSON representation for Duration (https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#json). When the workload exceeds this duration, it will be unconditionally terminated without waiting for ongoing work to finish. If ttl is not specified for a batch workload, the workload will be allowed to run until it exits naturally (or run forever without exiting). If ttl is not specified for an interactive session, it defaults to 24 hours. If ttl is not specified for a batch that uses 2.1+ runtime version, it defaults to 4 hours. Minimum value is 10 minutes; maximum value is 14 days. If both ttl and idle_ttl are specified (for an interactive session), the conditions are treated as OR conditions: the workload will be terminated when it has been idle for idle_ttl or when ttl has been exceeded, whichever occurs first.

  <pre>Lists interactive sessions.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent, which owns this collection of sessions. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. A filter for the sessions to return in the response.A filter is a logical expression constraining the values of various fields in each session resource. Filters are case sensitive, and may contain multiple clauses combined with logical operators (AND, OR). Supported fields are session_id, session_uuid, state, create_time, and labels.Example: state = ACTIVE and create_time &lt; &quot;2023-01-01T00:00:00Z&quot; is a filter for sessions in an ACTIVE state that were created before 2023-01-01. state = ACTIVE and labels.environment=production is a filter for sessions in an ACTIVE state that have a production environment label.See https://google.aip.dev/assets/misc/ebnf-filtering.txt for a detailed description of the filter syntax and a list of supported comparators.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of sessions to return in each response. The service may return fewer than this value.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token received from a previous ListSessions call. Provide this token to retrieve the subsequent page.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A list of interactive sessions.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A token, which can be sent as page_token, to retrieve the next page. If this field is omitted, there are no subsequent pages.
  &quot;sessions&quot;: [ # Output only. The sessions from the specified collection.

          &quot;idleTtl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Applies to sessions only. The duration to keep the session alive while it&#x27;s idling. Exceeding this threshold causes the session to terminate. This field cannot be set on a batch workload. Minimum value is 10 minutes; maximum value is 14 days (see JSON representation of Duration (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)). Defaults to 1 hour if not set. If both ttl and idle_ttl are specified for an interactive session, the conditions are treated as OR conditions: the workload will be terminated when it has been idle for idle_ttl or when ttl has been exceeded, whichever occurs first.
          &quot;kmsKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The Cloud KMS key to use for encryption.
          &quot;networkTags&quot;: [ # Optional. Tags used for network traffic control.

A Cloud Storage bucket used to stage workload dependencies, config files, and store workload output and other ephemeral data, such as Spark history files. If you do not specify a staging bucket, Cloud Dataproc will determine a Cloud Storage location according to the region where your workload is running, and then create and manage project-level, per-location staging and temporary buckets. This field requires a Cloud Storage bucket name, not a gs://... URI to a Cloud Storage bucket.
          &quot;subnetworkUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Subnetwork URI to connect workload to.
          &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The duration after which the workload will be terminated, specified as the JSON representation for Duration (https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#json). When the workload exceeds this duration, it will be unconditionally terminated without waiting for ongoing work to finish. If ttl is not specified for a batch workload, the workload will be allowed to run until it exits naturally (or run forever without exiting). If ttl is not specified for an interactive session, it defaults to 24 hours. If ttl is not specified for a batch that uses 2.1+ runtime version, it defaults to 4 hours. Minimum value is 10 minutes; maximum value is 14 days. If both ttl and idle_ttl are specified (for an interactive session), the conditions are treated as OR conditions: the workload will be terminated when it has been idle for idle_ttl or when ttl has been exceeded, whichever occurs first.
