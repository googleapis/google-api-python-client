  <pre>Create a DeploymentResourcePool.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent location resource where this DeploymentResourcePool will be created. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CreateDeploymentResourcePool method.
  &quot;deploymentResourcePool&quot;: { # A description of resources that can be shared by multiple DeployedModels, whose underlying specification consists of a DedicatedResources. # Required. The DeploymentResourcePool to create.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when this DeploymentResourcePool was created.
    &quot;dedicatedResources&quot;: { # A description of resources that are dedicated to a DeployedModel, and that need a higher degree of manual configuration. # Required. The underlying DedicatedResources that the DeploymentResourcePool uses.
      &quot;autoscalingMetricSpecs&quot;: [ # Immutable. The metric specifications that overrides a resource utilization metric (CPU utilization, accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle, and so on) target value (default to 60 if not set). At most one entry is allowed per metric. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is above 0, the autoscaling will be based on both CPU utilization and accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle metrics and scale up when either metrics exceeds its target value while scale down if both metrics are under their target value. The default target value is 60 for both metrics. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target value 60 if not explicitly set. For example, in the case of Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU utilization to 80, you should set autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization` and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to `80`.
        { # The metric specification that defines the target resource utilization (CPU utilization, accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle, and so on) for calculating the desired replica count.
          &quot;metricName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource metric name. Supported metrics: * For Online Prediction: * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/accelerator/duty_cycle` * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization`
          &quot;target&quot;: 42, # The target resource utilization in percentage (1% - 100%) for the given metric; once the real usage deviates from the target by a certain percentage, the machine replicas change. The default value is 60 (representing 60%) if not provided.
        },
      ],
      &quot;machineSpec&quot;: { # Specification of a single machine. # Required. Immutable. The specification of a single machine used by the prediction.
        &quot;acceleratorCount&quot;: 42, # The number of accelerators to attach to the machine.
        &quot;acceleratorType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached to the machine as per accelerator_count.

      },
      &quot;maxReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The maximum number of replicas this DeployedModel may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, will use min_replica_count as the default value. The value of this field impacts the charge against Vertex CPU and GPU quotas. Specifically, you will be charged for (max_replica_count * number of cores in the selected machine type) and (max_replica_count * number of GPUs per replica in the selected machine type).
      &quot;minReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Required. Immutable. The minimum number of machine replicas this DeployedModel will be always deployed on. This value must be greater than or equal to 1. If traffic against the DeployedModel increases, it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The resource name of the DeploymentResourcePool. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/deploymentResourcePools/{deployment_resource_pool}`
  },
  &quot;deploymentResourcePoolId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The ID to use for the DeploymentResourcePool, which will become the final component of the DeploymentResourcePool&#x27;s resource name. The maximum length is 63 characters, and valid characters are `/^[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$/`.

                &quot;noiseSigma&quot;: [ # Noise sigma per feature. No noise is added to features that are not set.
                  { # Noise sigma for a single feature.
                    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the input feature for which noise sigma is provided. The features are defined in explanation metadata inputs.
                    &quot;sigma&quot;: 3.14, # This represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel that will be used to add noise to the feature prior to computing gradients. Similar to noise_sigma but represents the noise added to the current feature. Defaults to 0.1.

                ],
              },
              &quot;noiseSigma&quot;: 3.14, # This is a single float value and will be used to add noise to all the features. Use this field when all features are normalized to have the same distribution: scale to range [0, 1], [-1, 1] or z-scoring, where features are normalized to have 0-mean and 1-variance. Learn more about [normalization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/transform/normalization). For best results the recommended value is about 10% - 20% of the standard deviation of the input feature. Refer to section 3.2 of the SmoothGrad paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf. Defaults to 0.1. If the distribution is different per feature, set feature_noise_sigma instead for each feature.
              &quot;noisySampleCount&quot;: 42, # The number of gradient samples to use for approximation. The higher this number, the more accurate the gradient is, but the runtime complexity increases by this factor as well. Valid range of its value is [1, 50]. Defaults to 3.
            },
            &quot;stepCount&quot;: 42, # Required. The number of steps for approximating the path integral. A good value to start is 50 and gradually increase until the sum to diff property is met within the desired error range. Valid range of its value is [1, 100], inclusively.

      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The ID of the DeployedModel. If not provided upon deployment, Vertex AI will generate a value for this ID. This value should be 1-10 characters, and valid characters are `/[0-9]/`.
      &quot;model&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource name of the Model that this is the deployment of. Note that the Model may be in a different location than the DeployedModel&#x27;s Endpoint. The resource name may contain version id or version alias to specify the version. Example: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/models/{model}@2` or `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/models/{model}@golden` if no version is specified, the default version will be deployed.
      &quot;modelVersionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The version ID of the model that is deployed.
      &quot;privateEndpoints&quot;: { # PrivateEndpoints proto is used to provide paths for users to send requests privately. To send request via private service access, use predict_http_uri, explain_http_uri or health_http_uri. To send request via private service connect, use service_attachment. # Output only. Provide paths for users to send predict/explain/health requests directly to the deployed model services running on Cloud via private services access. This field is populated if network is configured.
        &quot;explainHttpUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Http(s) path to send explain requests.
        &quot;healthHttpUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Http(s) path to send health check requests.
        &quot;predictHttpUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Http(s) path to send prediction requests.

      &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The service account that the DeployedModel&#x27;s container runs as. Specify the email address of the service account. If this service account is not specified, the container runs as a service account that doesn&#x27;t have access to the resource project. Users deploying the Model must have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission on this service account.
      &quot;sharedResources&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the shared DeploymentResourcePool to deploy on. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/deploymentResourcePools/{deployment_resource_pool}`
