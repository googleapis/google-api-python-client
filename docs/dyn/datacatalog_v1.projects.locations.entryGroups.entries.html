Data Catalog automatically creates entries with other types during metadata ingestion from integrated systems. You must enable the Data Catalog API in the project identified by the `parent` parameter. For more information, see [Data Catalog resource project](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/resource-project). An entry group can have a maximum of 100,000 entries.</p>

  <pre>Creates an entry. You can create entries only with &#x27;FILESET&#x27;, &#x27;CLUSTER&#x27;, &#x27;DATA_STREAM&#x27;, or custom types. Data Catalog automatically creates entries with other types during metadata ingestion from integrated systems. You must enable the Data Catalog API in the project identified by the `parent` parameter. For more information, see [Data Catalog resource project](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/concepts/resource-project). An entry group can have a maximum of 100,000 entries.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the entry group this entry belongs to. Note: The entry itself and its child resources might not be stored in the location specified in its name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Entry metadata. A Data Catalog entry represents another resource in Google Cloud Platform (such as a BigQuery dataset or a Pub/Sub topic) or outside of it. You can use the `linked_resource` field in the entry resource to refer to the original resource ID of the source system. An entry resource contains resource details, for example, its schema. Additionally, you can attach flexible metadata to an entry in the form of a Tag.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, readMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists entries. Note: Currently, this method can list only custom entries. To get a list of both custom and automatically created entries, use SearchCatalog.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the entry group that contains the entries to list. Can be provided in URL format. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of items to return. Default is 10. Maximum limit is 1000. Throws an invalid argument if `page_size` is more than 1000.
  pageToken: string, Pagination token that specifies the next page to return. If empty, the first page is returned.
  readMask: string, The fields to return for each entry. If empty or omitted, all fields are returned. For example, to return a list of entries with only the `name` field, set `read_mask` to only one path with the `name` value.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
