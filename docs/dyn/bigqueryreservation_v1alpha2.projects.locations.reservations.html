    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, reservationId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new reservation resource. Multiple reservations are created if the ancestor reservations do not exist.

Args:
  parent: string, Project, location, and (optionally) reservation name. E.g., projects/myproject/locations/us-central1/reservations/parent (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A reservation is a mechanism used to guarantee slots to users.
  &quot;useParentReservation&quot;: True or False, # If true, any query using this reservation will also be submitted to the parent reservation. This allows the query to share the additional slot capacity of the parent with other queries in the parent reservation. If the parent also has this field set to true, then this process will continue until it encounters a reservation for which this is false. If false, a query using this reservation will execute with the maximum slot capacity as specified above. If not specified, default value is true. Ignored for top-level reservation.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the reservation, e.g., &quot;projects/*/locations/*/reservations/dev/team/product&quot;. Reservation names (e.g., &quot;dev/team/product&quot;) exceeding a depth of six will fail with `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
  &quot;slotCapacity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Maximum slots available to this reservation and its children. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the unit of parallelism. In a scan of a multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates on a single partition of the table. If the new reservation&#x27;s slot capacity exceed the parent&#x27;s slot capacity or if total slot capacity of the new reservation and its siblings exceeds the parent&#x27;s slot capacity, the request will fail with `google.rpc.Code.RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`.
