<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified note or occurrence.
Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or
`containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is
a note or an occurrence, respectively.

The resource takes the format `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notes/[NOTE_ID]` for
notes and `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]` for
occurrences.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.

        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
        # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
        # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
      # request, the resource, or both.
