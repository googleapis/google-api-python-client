<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchCreate">batchCreate(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates new notes in batch.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project in the form of `projects/[PROJECT_ID]`, under which the notes are to be created. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to create notes in batch.
  &quot;notes&quot;: { # Required. The notes to create, the key is expected to be the note ID. Max allowed length is 1000.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: { # A type of analysis that can be done for a resource.
      &quot;attestationAuthority&quot;: { # Note kind that represents a logical attestation &quot;role&quot; or &quot;authority&quot;. For example, an organization might have one `Authority` for &quot;QA&quot; and one for &quot;build&quot;. This note is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability for a principle to attach an occurrence to a given note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached attestation occurrences, even if they don&#x27;t all live in the same project. # A note describing an attestation role.
        &quot;hint&quot;: { # This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of the authority. Because the name of a note acts as its resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes) from &quot;readable&quot; names more suitable for debug output. Note that these hints should not be used to look up authorities in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up attestations to verify. # Hint hints at the purpose of the attestation authority.
          &quot;humanReadableName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The human readable name of this attestation authority, for example &quot;qa&quot;.
        },
      },
      &quot;baseImage&quot;: { # Basis describes the base image portion (Note) of the DockerImage relationship. Linked occurrences are derived from this or an equivalent image via: FROM Or an equivalent reference, e.g. a tag of the resource_url. # A note describing a base image.
        &quot;fingerprint&quot;: { # A set of properties that uniquely identify a given Docker image. # Required. Immutable. The fingerprint of the base image.
          &quot;v1Name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The layer ID of the final layer in the Docker image&#x27;s v1 representation.
          &quot;v2Blob&quot;: [ # Required. The ordered list of v2 blobs that represent a given image.

        },
        &quot;resourceUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The resource_url for the resource representing the basis of associated occurrence images.

This could be either an ID for the key stored in `public_key` (such as the ID or fingerprint for a PGP key, or the CN for a cert), or a reference to an external key (such as a reference to a key in Cloud Key Management Service).
          &quot;keyType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of the key, either stored in `public_key` or referenced in `key_id`.
          &quot;publicKey&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Public key of the builder which can be used to verify that the related findings are valid and unchanged. If `key_type` is empty, this defaults to PEM encoded public keys. This field may be empty if `key_id` references an external key. For Cloud Build based signatures, this is a PEM encoded public key. To verify the Cloud Build signature, place the contents of this field into a file (public.pem). The signature field is base64-decoded into its binary representation in signature.bin, and the provenance bytes from `BuildDetails` are base64-decoded into a binary representation in signed.bin. OpenSSL can then verify the signature: `openssl sha256 -verify public.pem -signature signature.bin signed.bin`

    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a note or an occurrence resource. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a note or occurrence, respectively. The resource takes the format `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notes/[NOTE_ID]` for notes and `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]` for occurrences.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.
  &quot;options&quot;: { # Encapsulates settings provided to GetIamPolicy. # OPTIONAL: A `GetPolicyOptions` object for specifying options to `GetIamPolicy`.
    &quot;requestedPolicyVersion&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified note or occurrence. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a note or an occurrence, respectively. The resource takes the format `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notes/[NOTE_ID]` for notes and `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]` for occurrences.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`.

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
