<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves an aggregated list of persistent disks.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances whose name is not equal to example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.

The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.
    "items": { # [Output Only] A map of scoped disk lists.

              "options": "A String", # Internal use only.

For example, if you created the persistent disk from an image that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was used.
              "sourceSnapshotId": "A String", # [Output Only] The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk.

              "lastAttachTimestamp": "A String", # [Output Only] Last attach timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
              "sourceImage": "A String", # The source image used to create this disk. If the source image is deleted from the system, this field will not be set, even if an image with the same name has been re-created.
                  #
                  # When creating a disk, you can provide a private (custom) image using the following input, and Compute Engine will use the corresponding image from your project. For example:
                  #
                  # global/images/my-private-image
                  #
                  # Or you can provide an image from a publicly-available project. For example, to use a Debian image from the debian-cloud project, make sure to include the project in the URL:
                  #
                  # projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-7-wheezy-vYYYYMMDD
                  #
                  # where vYYYYMMDD is the image version. The fully-qualified URL will also work in both cases.
                  #
                  # You can also specify the latest image for a private image family by replacing the image name suffix with family/family-name. For example:
                  #
                  # global/images/family/my-private-family
                  #

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of persistent disks contained within the specified zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances whose name is not equal to example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

Compute Engine Beta API Only: If you use filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to organize and filter results based on label values.

The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.
