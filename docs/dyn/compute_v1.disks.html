<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addResourcePolicies">addResourcePolicies(project, zone, disk, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds existing resource policies to a disk. You can only add one policy which will be applied to this disk for scheduling snapshot creation.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  disk: string, The disk name for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "resourcePolicies": [ # Resource policies to be added to this disk.
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

          },
        ],
      },
    ],

  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves an aggregated list of persistent disks.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

  }

  guestFlush: boolean, [Input Only] Specifies to create an application consistent snapshot by informing the OS to prepare for the snapshot process. Currently only supported on Windows instances using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

        # To create a disk with one of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family name. For example, specify family/debian-9 to use the latest Debian 9 image:
        # projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
        # 
        # 
        # Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system image:
        # projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD
        # 
        # 
        # To create a disk with a custom image that you created, specify the image name in the following format:
        # global/images/my-custom-image
        # 
        # 
        # You can also specify a custom image by its image family, which returns the latest version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with family/family-name:
        # global/images/family/my-image-family
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  sourceImage: string, Optional. Source image to restore onto a disk.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of persistent disks contained within the specified zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="resize">resize(project, zone, disk, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Resizes the specified persistent disk. You can only increase the size of the disk.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  disk: string, The name of the persistent disk. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "sizeGb": "A String", # The new size of the persistent disk, which is specified in GB.
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setLabels">setLabels(project, zone, resource, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the labels on a disk. To learn more about labels, read the Labeling Resources documentation.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  resource: string, Name or id of the resource for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "labelFingerprint": "A String", # The fingerprint of the previous set of labels for this resource, used to detect conflicts. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels. Make a get() request to the resource to get the latest fingerprint.
    "labels": { # The labels to set for this resource.
      "a_key": "A String",
    },
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:
