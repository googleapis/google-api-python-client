<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(enterpriseId, userId, entitlementId)</code>
  <pre>Removes an entitlement to an app for a user.

Args:
  enterpriseId: string, The ID of the enterprise. (required)
  userId: string, The ID of the user. (required)
  entitlementId: string, The ID of the entitlement (a product ID), e.g. "app:com.google.android.gm". (required)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(enterpriseId, userId, entitlementId)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves details of an entitlement.

Args:
  enterpriseId: string, The ID of the enterprise. (required)
  userId: string, The ID of the user. (required)
  entitlementId: string, The ID of the entitlement (a product ID), e.g. "app:com.google.android.gm". (required)

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The presence of an Entitlements resource indicates that a user has the right to use a particular app. Entitlements are user specific, not device specific. This allows a user with an entitlement to an app to install the app on all their devices. It's also possible for a user to hold an entitlement to an app without installing the app on any device.
        #
        # The API can be used to create an entitlement. As an option, you can also use the API to trigger the installation of an app on all a user's managed devices at the same time the entitlement is created.
        #
        # If the app is free, creating the entitlement also creates a group license for that app. For paid apps, creating the entitlement consumes one license, and that license remains consumed until the entitlement is removed. If the enterprise hasn't purchased enough licenses, then no entitlement is created and the installation fails. An entitlement is also not created for an app if the app requires permissions that the enterprise hasn't accepted.
        #
        # If an entitlement is deleted, the app may be uninstalled from a user's device. As a best practice, uninstall the app by calling  Installs.delete() before deleting the entitlement.
