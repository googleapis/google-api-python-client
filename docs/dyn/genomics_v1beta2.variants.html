Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A variant represents a change in DNA sequence relative to a reference sequence. For example, a variant could represent a SNP or an insertion. Variants belong to a variant set. Each of the calls on a variant represent a determination of genotype with respect to that variant. For example, a call might assign probability of 0.32 to the occurrence of a SNP named rs1234 in a sample named NA12345. A call belongs to a call set, which contains related calls typically from one sample.

      "end": "A String", # The end position (0-based) of this variant. This corresponds to the first base after the last base in the reference allele.

If the genotype was instead [0, 1], the represented value would be TA. Ordering of the genotype values is important if the phaseset is present. If a genotype is not called (that is, a . is present in the GT string) -1 is returned.
