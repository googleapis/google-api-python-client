<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of interconnect locations available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response to the list request, and contains a list of interconnect locations.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.
