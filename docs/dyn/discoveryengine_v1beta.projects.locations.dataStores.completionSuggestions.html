  <pre>Imports CompletionSuggestions for a DataStore.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent data store resource name for which to import customer autocomplete suggestions. Follows pattern `projects/*/locations/*/collections/*/dataStores/*` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CompletionService.ImportCompletionSuggestions method.
  &quot;bigquerySource&quot;: { # BigQuery source import data from. # BigQuery input source.
    &quot;dataSchema&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The schema to use when parsing the data from the source. Supported values for user event imports: * `user_event` (default): One UserEvent per row. Supported values for document imports: * `document` (default): One Document format per row. Each document must have a valid Document.id and one of Document.json_data or Document.struct_data. * `custom`: One custom data per row in arbitrary format that conforms to the defined Schema of the data store. This can only be used by the GENERIC Data Store vertical.
    &quot;datasetId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The BigQuery data set to copy the data from with a length limit of 1,024 characters.
    &quot;gcsStagingDir&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Intermediate Cloud Storage directory used for the import with a length limit of 2,000 characters. Can be specified if one wants to have the BigQuery export to a specific Cloud Storage directory.
    &quot;partitionDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, such as a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are insignificant. The date is relative to the Gregorian Calendar. This can represent one of the following: * A full date, with non-zero year, month, and day values. * A month and day, with a zero year (for example, an anniversary). * A year on its own, with a zero month and a zero day. * A year and month, with a zero day (for example, a credit card expiration date). Related types: * google.type.TimeOfDay * google.type.DateTime * google.protobuf.Timestamp # BigQuery time partitioned table&#x27;s _PARTITIONDATE in YYYY-MM-DD format.
      &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn&#x27;t significant.
      &quot;month&quot;: 42, # Month of a year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 to specify a year without a month and day.
      &quot;year&quot;: 42, # Year of the date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 to specify a date without a year.
    },
    &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The project ID or the project number that contains the BigQuery source. Has a length limit of 128 characters. If not specified, inherits the project ID from the parent request.
    &quot;tableId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The BigQuery table to copy the data from with a length limit of 1,024 characters.
  },
  &quot;errorConfig&quot;: { # Configuration of destination for Import related errors. # The desired location of errors incurred during the Import.
    &quot;gcsPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Cloud Storage prefix for import errors. This must be an empty, existing Cloud Storage directory. Import errors are written to sharded files in this directory, one per line, as a JSON-encoded `google.rpc.Status` message.
  },
  &quot;gcsSource&quot;: { # Cloud Storage location for input content. # Cloud Storage location for the input content.
    &quot;dataSchema&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The schema to use when parsing the data from the source. Supported values for document imports: * `document` (default): One JSON Document per line. Each document must have a valid Document.id. * `content`: Unstructured data (e.g. PDF, HTML). Each file matched by `input_uris` becomes a document, with the ID set to the first 128 bits of SHA256(URI) encoded as a hex string. * `custom`: One custom data JSON per row in arbitrary format that conforms to the defined Schema of the data store. This can only be used by the GENERIC Data Store vertical. * `csv`: A CSV file with header conforming to the defined Schema of the data store. Each entry after the header is imported as a Document. This can only be used by the GENERIC Data Store vertical. Supported values for user event imports: * `user_event` (default): One JSON UserEvent per line.
    &quot;inputUris&quot;: [ # Required. Cloud Storage URIs to input files. Each URI can be up to 2000 characters long. URIs can match the full object path (for example, `gs://bucket/directory/object.json`) or a pattern matching one or more files, such as `gs://bucket/directory/*.json`. A request can contain at most 100 files (or 100,000 files if `data_schema` is `content`). Each file can be up to 2 GB (or 100 MB if `data_schema` is `content`).
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;inlineSource&quot;: { # The inline source for CompletionSuggestions. # The Inline source for suggestion entries.
    &quot;suggestions&quot;: [ # Required. A list of all denylist entries to import. Max of 1000 items.
      { # Autocomplete suggestions that are imported from Customer.
        &quot;alternativePhrases&quot;: [ # Alternative matching phrases for this suggestion.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;frequency&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Frequency of this suggestion. Will be used to rank suggestions when score is not available.
        &quot;globalScore&quot;: 3.14, # Global score of this suggestion. Control how this suggestion would be scored / ranked.
        &quot;groupId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If two suggestions have the same groupId, they will not be returned together. Instead the one ranked higher will be returned. This can be used to deduplicate semantically identical suggestions.
        &quot;groupScore&quot;: 3.14, # The score of this suggestion within its group.
        &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # BCP-47 language code of this suggestion.
        &quot;suggestion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The suggestion text.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
