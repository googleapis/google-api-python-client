  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, *Note:* This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners. The *onBehalfOfContentOwner* parameter indicates that the request&#x27;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.

Args:
  part: string, The *part* parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include. (required) (repeated)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A *playlistItem* resource identifies another resource, such as a video, that is included in a playlist. In addition, the playlistItem resource contains details about the included resource that pertain specifically to how that resource is used in that playlist. YouTube uses playlists to identify special collections of videos for a channel, such as: - uploaded videos - favorite videos - positively rated (liked) videos - watch history - watch later To be more specific, these lists are associated with a channel, which is a collection of a person, group, or company&#x27;s videos, playlists, and other YouTube information. You can retrieve the playlist IDs for each of these lists from the channel resource for a given channel. You can then use the playlistItems.list method to retrieve any of those lists. You can also add or remove items from those lists by calling the playlistItems.insert and playlistItems.delete methods. For example, if a user gives a positive rating to a video, you would insert that video into the liked videos playlist for that user&#x27;s channel.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(part, body=None, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates an existing resource.

Args:
  part: string, The *part* parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include. Note that this method will override the existing values for all of the mutable properties that are contained in any parts that the parameter value specifies. For example, a playlist item can specify a start time and end time, which identify the times portion of the video that should play when users watch the video in the playlist. If your request is updating a playlist item that sets these values, and the request&#x27;s part parameter value includes the contentDetails part, the playlist item&#x27;s start and end times will be updated to whatever value the request body specifies. If the request body does not specify values, the existing start and end times will be removed and replaced with the default settings. (required) (repeated)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A *playlistItem* resource identifies another resource, such as a video, that is included in a playlist. In addition, the playlistItem resource contains details about the included resource that pertain specifically to how that resource is used in that playlist. YouTube uses playlists to identify special collections of videos for a channel, such as: - uploaded videos - favorite videos - positively rated (liked) videos - watch history - watch later To be more specific, these lists are associated with a channel, which is a collection of a person, group, or company&#x27;s videos, playlists, and other YouTube information. You can retrieve the playlist IDs for each of these lists from the channel resource for a given channel. You can then use the playlistItems.list method to retrieve any of those lists. You can also add or remove items from those lists by calling the playlistItems.insert and playlistItems.delete methods. For example, if a user gives a positive rating to a video, you would insert that video into the liked videos playlist for that user&#x27;s channel.

  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, *Note:* This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners.
