<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="acknowledge">acknowledge(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Acknowledges a pull task.

The worker, that is, the entity that
leased this task must call this method
to indicate that the work associated with the task has finished.

The worker must acknowledge a task within the
lease_duration or the lease
will expire and the task will become available to be leased
again. After the task is acknowledged, it will not be returned
by a later LeaseTasks,
GetTask, or
ListTasks.

Args:
  name: string, Required.

The task name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID` (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for acknowledging a task using
      # AcknowledgeTask.
    "scheduleTime": "A String", # Required.
        # 
        # The task's current schedule time, available in the
        # schedule_time returned by
        # LeaseTasks response or
        # RenewLease response. This restriction is
        # to ensure that your worker currently holds the lease.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="cancelLease">cancelLease(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Cancel a pull task's lease.

The worker can use this method to cancel a task's lease by
setting its schedule_time to now. This will
make the task available to be leased to the next caller of
LeaseTasks.

Args:
  name: string, Required.

The task name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID` (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for canceling a lease using
      # CancelLease.
    "scheduleTime": "A String", # Required.
        # 
        # The task's current schedule time, available in the
        # schedule_time returned by
        # LeaseTasks response or
        # RenewLease response. This restriction is
        # to ensure that your worker currently holds the lease.
    "responseView": "A String", # The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
        # returned.
        # 
        # By default response_view is BASIC; not all
        # information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
        # payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
        # of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
        # contains.
        # 
        # Authorization for FULL requires
        # `cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)
        # permission on the Task resource.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

        # The user can optionally specify a task name. If a

        # Task De-duplication:
        # 
        # Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication.  If
        # a task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task
        # that was deleted or completed recently then the call will fail
        # with ALREADY_EXISTS.
        # If the task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with
        # the same name can't be created for ~1hour after the original task was
        # deleted or completed. If the task's queue was created using queue.yaml or
        # queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created
        # for ~9days after the original task was deleted or completed.
        # 
        # Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task
        # names, these CreateTask calls have significantly
        # increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for
        # the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that
        # are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a task.

A task can be deleted if it is scheduled or dispatched. A task
cannot be deleted if it has completed successfully or permanently
failed.

Args:
  name: string, Required.

The task name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID` (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, responseView=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets a task.

Args:
  name: string, Required.

The task name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID` (required)
  responseView: string, The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
returned.

By default response_view is BASIC; not all
information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
contains.

Authorization for FULL requires
`cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)
permission on the Task resource.

worker must acknowledge the task via
AcknowledgeTask after they have
performed the work associated with the task.

The payload is intended to store data that
the worker needs to perform the work associated with the task. To
return the payloads in the response, set
response_view to
FULL.

A maximum of 10 qps of LeaseTasks
requests are allowed per
queue. RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
is returned when this limit is
exceeded. RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
is also returned when
max_tasks_dispatched_per_second
is exceeded.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The queue name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for leasing tasks using LeaseTasks.
    "maxTasks": 42, # The maximum number of tasks to lease.
        # 
        # The system will make a best effort to return as close to as
        # `max_tasks` as possible.
        # 
        # The largest that `max_tasks` can be is 1000.
        # 
        # The maximum total size of a lease tasks response is
        # 32 MB. If the sum of all task sizes requested reaches this limit,
        # fewer tasks than requested are returned.
    "filter": "A String", # `filter` can be used to specify a subset of tasks to lease.
        # 
        # When `filter` is set to `tag=<my-tag>` then the
        # response will contain only tasks whose
        # tag is equal to `<my-tag>`. `<my-tag>` must be
        # less than 500 characters.
        # 
        # When `filter` is set to `tag_function=oldest_tag()`, only tasks which have
        # the same tag as the task with the oldest
        # schedule_time will be returned.
        # 
        # Grammar Syntax:
        # 
        # * `filter = "tag=" tag | "tag_function=" function`
        # 
        # * `tag = string`
        # 
        # * `function = "oldest_tag()"`
        # 
        # The `oldest_tag()` function returns tasks which have the same tag as the
        # oldest task (ordered by schedule time).
        # 
        # SDK compatibility: Although the SDK allows tags to be either
        # string or
        # [bytes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/taskqueue/TaskOptions.html#tag-byte:A-),
        # only UTF-8 encoded tags can be used in Cloud Tasks. Tag which
        # aren't UTF-8 encoded can't be used in the
        # filter and the task's
        # tag will be displayed as empty in Cloud Tasks.
    "responseView": "A String", # The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
        # returned.
        # 
        # By default response_view is BASIC; not all
        # information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
        # payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
        # of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
        # contains.
        # 
        # Authorization for FULL requires
        # `cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)
        # permission on the Task resource.
    "leaseDuration": "A String", # 
        # After the worker has successfully finished the work associated
        # with the task, the worker must call via
        # AcknowledgeTask before the
        # schedule_time. Otherwise the task will be
        # returned to a later LeaseTasks call so
        # that another worker can retry it.
        # 
        # The maximum lease duration is 1 week.
        # `lease_duration` will be truncated to the nearest second.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, responseView=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the tasks in a queue.

By default, only the BASIC view is retrieved
due to performance considerations;
response_view controls the
subset of information which is returned.

The tasks may be returned in any order. The ordering may change at any
time.

Args:
  parent: string, Required.

The queue name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` (required)
  responseView: string, The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
returned.

By default response_view is BASIC; not all
information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
contains.

Authorization for FULL requires
`cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)
permission on the Task resource.
  pageSize: integer, Maximum page size.

Fewer tasks than requested might be returned, even if more tasks exist; use
next_page_token in the response to
determine if more tasks exist.

The maximum page size is 1000. If unspecified, the page size will be the
maximum.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying the page of results to return.

To request the first page results, page_token must be empty. To
request the next page of results, page_token must be the value of
next_page_token returned
from the previous call to ListTasks
method.

The page token is valid for only 2 hours.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for listing tasks using ListTasks.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # A token to retrieve next page of results.
        #
        # To return the next page of results, call
        # ListTasks with this value as the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="run">run(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Forces a task to run now.

When this method is called, Cloud Tasks will dispatch the task, even if
the task is already running, the queue has reached its RateLimits or
is PAUSED.

This command is meant to be used for manual debugging. For
example, RunTask can be used to retry a failed
task after a fix has been made or to manually force a task to be
dispatched now.

The dispatched task is returned. That is, the task that is returned
contains the status after the task is dispatched but
before the task is received by its target.

If Cloud Tasks receives a successful response from the task's
target, then the task will be deleted; otherwise the task's
schedule_time will be reset to the time that
RunTask was called plus the retry delay specified
in the queue's RetryConfig.

RunTask returns
NOT_FOUND when it is called on a
task that has already succeeded or permanently failed.

RunTask cannot be called on a
pull task.

Args:
  name: string, Required.

The task name. For example:
`projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID` (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for forcing a task to run now using
      # RunTask.
    "responseView": "A String", # The response_view specifies which subset of the Task will be
        # returned.
        # 
        # By default response_view is BASIC; not all
        # information is retrieved by default because some data, such as
        # payloads, might be desirable to return only when needed because
        # of its large size or because of the sensitivity of data that it
        # contains.
        # 
        # Authorization for FULL requires
        # `cloudtasks.tasks.fullView` [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)

          # Repeated headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas.
          #
          # Cloud Tasks sets some headers to default values:
          #
          # * `User-Agent`: By default, this header is
          #   `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`.
          #   This header can be modified, but Cloud Tasks will append
          #   `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the
          #   modified `User-Agent`.
          #
          # If the task has a payload, Cloud
          # Tasks sets the following headers:
          #
          # * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
          #   `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by explicitly
          #   setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
          #   task is created.
          #   For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`.
          # * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Tasks. This value is
          #   output only.   It cannot be changed.
          #
          # The headers below cannot be set or overridden:
          #
          # * `Host`
          # * `X-Google-*`
          # * `X-AppEngine-*`
          #
          # In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task is dispatched,
          # such as headers containing information about the task; see
          # [request
          # headers](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/push/creating-handlers#reading_request_headers).
          # These headers are set only when the task is dispatched, so they are not
          # visible when the task is returned in a Cloud Tasks response.
          #
          # Although there is no specific limit for the maximum number of headers or
          # the size, there is a limit on the maximum size of the Task. For more
          # information, see the CreateTask documentation.
