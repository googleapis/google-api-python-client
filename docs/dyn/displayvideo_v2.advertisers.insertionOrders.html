<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(advertiserId, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists insertion orders in an advertiser. The order is defined by the order_by parameter. If a filter by entity_status is not specified, insertion orders with `ENTITY_STATUS_ARCHIVED` will not be included in the results.

Args:
  advertiserId: string, Required. The ID of the advertiser to list insertion orders for. (required)
  filter: string, Allows filtering by insertion order fields. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The `updateTime` field must use the `GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (&gt;=)` or `LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO (&lt;=)` operators. * All other fields must use the `EQUALS (=)` operator. Supported fields: * `campaignId` * `displayName` * `entityStatus` * `updateTime` (input in ISO 8601 format, or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`) Examples: * All insertion orders under a campaign: `campaignId=&quot;1234&quot;` * All `ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE` or `ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED` insertion orders under an advertiser: `(entityStatus=&quot;ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE&quot; OR entityStatus=&quot;ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED&quot;)` * All insertion orders with an update time less than or equal to 2020-11-04T18:54:47Z (format of ISO 8601): `updateTime&lt;=&quot;2020-11-04T18:54:47Z&quot;` * All insertion orders with an update time greater than or equal to 2020-11-04T18:54:47Z (format of ISO 8601): `updateTime&gt;=&quot;2020-11-04T18:54:47Z&quot;` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters. Reference our [filter `LIST` requests](/display-video/api/guides/how-tos/filters) guide for more information.
  orderBy: string, Field by which to sort the list. Acceptable values are: * &quot;displayName&quot; (default) * &quot;entityStatus&quot; * &quot;updateTime&quot; The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix &quot;desc&quot; should be added to the field name. Example: `displayName desc`.
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. Must be between `1` and `100`. If unspecified will default to `100`. Returns error code `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if an invalid value is specified.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying a page of results the server should return. Typically, this is the value of next_page_token returned from the previous call to `ListInsertionOrders` method. If not specified, the first page of results will be returned.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Example: If set to `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM`, the bid price will be based on the probability that each available impression will be viewable. For example, if viewable CPM target is $2 and an impression is 40% likely to be viewable, the bid price will be $0.80 CPM (40% of $2). For example, 1500000 represents 1.5 standard units of the currency or ROAS value.
