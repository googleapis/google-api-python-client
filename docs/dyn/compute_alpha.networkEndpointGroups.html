<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of network endpoint groups and sorts them by zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
    </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="attachNetworkEndpoints">attachNetworkEndpoints(project, zone, networkEndpointGroup, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Attach a list of network endpoints to the specified network endpoint group.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. (required)
  networkEndpointGroup: string, The name of the network endpoint group where you are attaching network endpoints to. It should comply with RFC1035. (required)

    The object takes the form of:

{
    "networkEndpoints": [ # The list of network endpoints to be attached.
      { # The network endpoint.
        "port": 42, # Optional port number of network endpoint. If not specified and the NetworkEndpointGroup.network_endpoint_type is GCE_IP_PORT, the defaultPort for the network endpoint group will be used.
        "instance": "A String", # The name for a specific VM instance that the IP address belongs to. This is required for network endpoints of type GCE_VM_IP_PORT. The instance must be in the same zone of network endpoint group.
            #

      },
    ],
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="detachNetworkEndpoints">detachNetworkEndpoints(project, zone, networkEndpointGroup, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Detach a list of network endpoints from the specified network endpoint group.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. (required)
  networkEndpointGroup: string, The name of the network endpoint group where you are removing network endpoints. It should comply with RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "networkEndpoints": [ # The list of network endpoints to be detached.
      { # The network endpoint.
        "port": 42, # Optional port number of network endpoint. If not specified and the NetworkEndpointGroup.network_endpoint_type is GCE_IP_PORT, the defaultPort for the network endpoint group will be used.
        "instance": "A String", # The name for a specific VM instance that the IP address belongs to. This is required for network endpoints of type GCE_VM_IP_PORT. The instance must be in the same zone of network endpoint group.
            #
            # The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
        "ipAddress": "A String", # Optional IPv4 address of network endpoint. The IP address must belong to a VM in GCE (either the primary IP or as part of an aliased IP range). If the IP address is not specified, then the primary IP address for the VM instance in the network that the network endpoint group belongs to will be used.
        "annotations": { # Metadata defined as annotations on the network endpoint.
          "a_key": "A String",
        },

      },
    ],
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of network endpoint groups that are located in the specified project and zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

    <code class="details" id="listNetworkEndpoints">listNetworkEndpoints(project, zone, networkEndpointGroup, body, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the network endpoints in the specified network endpoint group.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone where the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. (required)
  networkEndpointGroup: string, The name of the network endpoint group from which you want to generate a list of included network endpoints. It should comply with RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "healthStatus": "A String", # Optional query parameter for showing the health status of each network endpoint. Valid options are SKIP or SHOW. If you don't specifiy this parameter, the health status of network endpoints will not be provided.
    "endpointFilters": [ # Optional list of endpoints to query. This is a more efficient but also limited version of filter parameter. Endpoints in the filter must have ip_address and port fields populated, other fields are not supported.
      {
        "networkEndpoint": { # The network endpoint.
          "port": 42, # Optional port number of network endpoint. If not specified and the NetworkEndpointGroup.network_endpoint_type is GCE_IP_PORT, the defaultPort for the network endpoint group will be used.
          "instance": "A String", # The name for a specific VM instance that the IP address belongs to. This is required for network endpoints of type GCE_VM_IP_PORT. The instance must be in the same zone of network endpoint group.
              #
              # The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
          "ipAddress": "A String", # Optional IPv4 address of network endpoint. The IP address must belong to a VM in GCE (either the primary IP or as part of an aliased IP range). If the IP address is not specified, then the primary IP address for the VM instance in the network that the network endpoint group belongs to will be used.
          "annotations": { # Metadata defined as annotations on the network endpoint.
            "a_key": "A String",
          },
          "fqdn": "A String", # Optional fully qualified domain name of network endpoint. This can only be specified when NetworkEndpointGroup.network_endpoint_type is NON_GCP_FQDN_PORT.
        },
      },
    ],
  }

  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.
