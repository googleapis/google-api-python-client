<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="test">test(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Test `Source` for syntactic and semantic correctness. Issues present, if
any, will be returned to the caller with a description, severity, and
source location.

The test method may be executed with `Source` or a `Ruleset` name.
Passing `Source` is useful for unit testing new rules. Passing a `Ruleset`
name is useful for regression testing an existing rule.

The following is an example of `Source` that permits users to upload images
to a bucket bearing their user id and matching the correct metadata:

_*Example*_

    // Users are allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe to the blog.
    service firebase.storage {
      match /users/{userId}/images/{imageName} {
          allow write: if userId == request.auth.uid
              && (imageName.matches('*.png$')
              || imageName.matches('*.jpg$'))
              && resource.mimeType.matches('^image/')
      }
    }

Args:
  name: string, Tests may either provide `source` or a `Ruleset` resource name.

For tests against `source`, the resource name must refer to the project:
Format: `projects/{project_id}`

For tests against a `Ruleset`, this must be the `Ruleset` resource name:
Format: `projects/{project_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for FirebaseRulesService.TestRuleset.
    "source": { # `Source` is one or more `File` messages comprising a logical set of rules. # Optional `Source` to be checked for correctness.
        # 
        # This field must not be set when the resource name refers to a `Ruleset`.
      "files": [ # `File` set constituting the `Source` bundle.
        { # `File` containing source content.
          "content": "A String", # Textual Content.
          "name": "A String", # File name.
          "fingerprint": "A String", # Fingerprint (e.g. github sha) associated with the `File`.
        },
      ],
    },
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response for FirebaseRulesService.TestRuleset.
    "testResults": [ # The set of test results given the test cases in the `TestSuite`.
        # The results will appear in the same order as the test cases appear in the
