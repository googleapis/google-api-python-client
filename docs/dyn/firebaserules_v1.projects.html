<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="test">test(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Test `Source` for syntactic and semantic correctness. Issues present, if
any, will be returned to the caller with a description, severity, and
source location.

The test method may be executed with `Source` or a `Ruleset` name.
Passing `Source` is useful for unit testing new rules. Passing a `Ruleset`
name is useful for regression testing an existing rule.

The following is an example of `Source` that permits users to upload images
to a bucket bearing their user id and matching the correct metadata:

_*Example*_

    // Users are allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe to the blog.
    service firebase.storage {
      match /users/{userId}/images/{imageName} {
          allow write: if userId == request.auth.uid
              &amp;&amp; (imageName.matches(&#x27;*.png$&#x27;)
              || imageName.matches(&#x27;*.jpg$&#x27;))
              &amp;&amp; resource.mimeType.matches(&#x27;^image/&#x27;)
      }
    }

Args:
  name: string, Tests may either provide `source` or a `Ruleset` resource name.

For tests against `source`, the resource name must refer to the project:
Format: `projects/{project_id}`

For tests against a `Ruleset`, this must be the `Ruleset` resource name:
Format: `projects/{project_id}/rulesets/{ruleset_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
