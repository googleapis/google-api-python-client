  <pre>Creates an App Engine application for a Google Cloud Platform project. Required fields:
id - The ID of the target Cloud Platform project.
location - The region (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/locations) where you want the App Engine application located.For more information about App Engine applications, see Managing Projects, Applications, and Billing (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/console/).

Args:

        "domain": "A String", # Domain name to match against. The wildcard "*" is supported if specified before a period: "*.".Defaults to matching all domains: "*".
        "module": "A String", # Resource ID of a module in this application that should serve the matched request. The module must already exist. Example: default.
      },
    ],
    "defaultCookieExpiration": "A String", # Cookie expiration policy for this application.
    "id": "A String", # Identifier of the Application resource. This identifier is equivalent to the project ID of the Google Cloud Platform project where you want to deploy your application. Example: myapp.
    "location": "A String", # Location from which this application will be run. Application instances will run out of data centers in the chosen location, which is also where all of the application's end user content is stored.Defaults to us-central.Options are:us-central - Central USeurope-west - Western Europeus-east1 - Eastern US

    "iap": { # Identity-Aware Proxy
      "oauth2ClientSecretSha256": "A String", # Hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the client secret.@OutputOnly
      "enabled": True or False, # Whether the serving infrastructure will authenticate and authorize all incoming requests.If true, the oauth2_client_id and oauth2_client_secret fields must be non-empty.

    },
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
    "error": { # The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC (https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be: # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # Simple to use and understand for most users
        # Flexible enough to meet unexpected needsOverviewThe Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers understand and resolve the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package google.rpc that can be used for common error conditions.Language mappingThe Status message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the Status message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.Other usesThe error model and the Status message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments.Example uses of this error model include:
        # Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the Status in the normal response to indicate the partial errors.
        # Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a Status message for error reporting.
        # Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the Status message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response.
        # Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the Status message.
        # Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message Status could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There will be a common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {

        },
      ],
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is false, it means the operation is still in progress. If true, the operation is completed, and either error or response is available.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete, the response is google.protobuf.Empty. If the original method is standard Get/Create/Update, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type XxxResponse, where Xxx is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is TakeSnapshot(), the inferred response type is TakeSnapshotResponse.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the name should have the format of operations/some/unique/name.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
