        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">

Args:

  rating: string, A parameter (required)
    Allowed values
      none - 
      like - The entity is liked.
      dislike - The entity is disliked.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="reportAbuse">reportAbuse(body=None, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Report abuse for a video.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Additional comments regarding the abuse report.
  &quot;language&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The language that the content was viewed in.
  &quot;reasonId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The high-level, or primary, reason that the content is abusive. The value is an abuse report reason ID.
  &quot;secondaryReasonId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The specific, or secondary, reason that this content is abusive (if available). The value is an abuse report reason ID that is a valid secondary reason for the primary reason.
  &quot;videoId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID that YouTube uses to uniquely identify the video.
}

  onBehalfOfContentOwner: string, *Note:* This parameter is intended exclusively for YouTube content partners. The *onBehalfOfContentOwner* parameter indicates that the request&#x27;s authorization credentials identify a YouTube CMS user who is acting on behalf of the content owner specified in the parameter value. This parameter is intended for YouTube content partners that own and manage many different YouTube channels. It allows content owners to authenticate once and get access to all their video and channel data, without having to provide authentication credentials for each individual channel. The CMS account that the user authenticates with must be linked to the specified YouTube content owner.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(part, body=None, onBehalfOfContentOwner=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates an existing resource.

Args:
  part: string, The *part* parameter serves two purposes in this operation. It identifies the properties that the write operation will set as well as the properties that the API response will include. Note that this method will override the existing values for all of the mutable properties that are contained in any parts that the parameter value specifies. For example, a video&#x27;s privacy setting is contained in the status part. As such, if your request is updating a private video, and the request&#x27;s part parameter value includes the status part, the video&#x27;s privacy setting will be updated to whatever value the request body specifies. If the request body does not specify a value, the existing privacy setting will be removed and the video will revert to the default privacy setting. In addition, not all parts contain properties that can be set when inserting or updating a video. For example, the statistics object encapsulates statistics that YouTube calculates for a video and does not contain values that you can set or modify. If the parameter value specifies a part that does not contain mutable values, that part will still be included in the API response. (required) (repeated)
