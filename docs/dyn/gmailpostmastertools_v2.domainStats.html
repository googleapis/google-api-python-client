  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for BatchQueryDomainStats.
  &quot;requests&quot;: [ # Required. A list of individual query requests. Each request can be for a different domain. A maximum of 100 requests can be included in a single batch.
    { # Request message for QueryDomainStats.
      &quot;aggregationGranularity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The granularity at which to aggregate the statistics. If unspecified, defaults to DAILY.
      &quot;metricDefinitions&quot;: [ # Required. The specific metrics to query. You can define a custom name for each metric, which will be used in the response.
        { # Defines a specific metric to query, including a user-defined name, the base metric type, and optional filters.
          &quot;baseMetric&quot;: { # Specifies the base metric to query, which can be a predefined standard metric or a user-defined custom metric (if supported in the future). # Required. The underlying metric to query.
            &quot;standardMetric&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A predefined standard metric.
          },
          &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Optional filters to apply to the metric.
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The user-defined name for this metric. This name will be used as the key for this metric&#x27;s value in the response.
        },
      ],

      &quot;pageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The next_page_token value returned from a previous List request, if any. If the aggregation granularity is DAILY, the page token will be the encoded date + &quot;/&quot; + metric name. If the aggregation granularity is OVERALL, the page token will be the encoded metric name.
