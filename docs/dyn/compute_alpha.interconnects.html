<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(project, interconnect, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the specified interconnect.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  interconnect: string, Name of the interconnect to delete. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of interconnect available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response to the list request, and contains a list of interconnects.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setLabels">setLabels(project, resource, body)</code>
  <pre>Sets the labels on an Interconnect. To learn more about labels, read the Labeling Resources documentation.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  resource: string, Name or id of the resource for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "labelFingerprint": "A String", # The fingerprint of the previous set of labels for this resource, used to detect conflicts. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash when updating or changing labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. Make a get() request to the resource to get the latest fingerprint.
    "labels": { # A list of labels to apply for this resource. Each label key & value must comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. For example, "webserver-frontend": "images". A label value can also be empty (e.g. "my-label": "").
      "a_key": "A String",

Returns:
  An object of the form:
