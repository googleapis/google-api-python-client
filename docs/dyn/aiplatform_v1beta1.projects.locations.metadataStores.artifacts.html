Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Artifacts in the MetadataStore.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The MetadataStore whose Artifacts should be listed. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/metadataStores/{metadatastore}` (required)
  filter: string, Filter specifying the boolean condition for the Artifacts to satisfy in order to be part of the result set. The syntax to define filter query is based on https://google.aip.dev/160. The supported set of filters include the following: * **Attribute filtering**: For example: `display_name = &quot;test&quot;`. Supported fields include: `name`, `display_name`, `uri`, `state`, `schema_title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`. Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339 format. For example: `create_time = &quot;2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00&quot;` * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..`. For example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0` In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example: `metadata.&quot;field:1&quot;.number_value = 10.0` * **Context based filtering**: To filter Artifacts based on the contexts to which they belong, use the function operator with the full resource name `in_context()`. For example: `in_context(&quot;projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/&quot;)` Each of the above supported filter types can be combined together using logical operators (`AND` &amp; `OR`). Maximum nested expression depth allowed is 5. For example: `display_name = &quot;test&quot; AND metadata.field1.bool_value = true`.
  orderBy: string, How the list of messages is ordered. Specify the values to order by and an ordering operation. The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, users append a &quot; desc&quot; suffix; for example: &quot;foo desc, bar&quot;. Subfields are specified with a `.` character, such as foo.bar. see https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering for more details.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of Artifacts to return. The service may return fewer. Must be in range 1-1000, inclusive. Defaults to 100.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous MetadataService.ListArtifacts call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other provided parameters must match the call that provided the page token. (Otherwise the request will fail with INVALID_ARGUMENT error.)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

    <code class="details" id="queryArtifactLineageSubgraph">queryArtifactLineageSubgraph(artifact, filter=None, maxHops=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves lineage of an Artifact represented through Artifacts and Executions connected by Event edges and returned as a LineageSubgraph.

Args:
  artifact: string, Required. The resource name of the Artifact whose Lineage needs to be retrieved as a LineageSubgraph. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/metadataStores/{metadatastore}/artifacts/{artifact}` The request may error with FAILED_PRECONDITION if the number of Artifacts, the number of Executions, or the number of Events that would be returned for the Context exceeds 1000. (required)
  filter: string, Filter specifying the boolean condition for the Artifacts to satisfy in order to be part of the Lineage Subgraph. The syntax to define filter query is based on https://google.aip.dev/160. The supported set of filters include the following: * **Attribute filtering**: For example: `display_name = &quot;test&quot;` Supported fields include: `name`, `display_name`, `uri`, `state`, `schema_title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`. Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339 format. For example: `create_time = &quot;2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00&quot;` * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..`. For example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0` In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example: `metadata.&quot;field:1&quot;.number_value = 10.0` Each of the above supported filter types can be combined together using logical operators (`AND` &amp; `OR`). Maximum nested expression depth allowed is 5. For example: `display_name = &quot;test&quot; AND metadata.field1.bool_value = true`.
  maxHops: integer, Specifies the size of the lineage graph in terms of number of hops from the specified artifact. Negative Value: INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned 0: Only input artifact is returned. No value: Transitive closure is performed to return the complete graph.
