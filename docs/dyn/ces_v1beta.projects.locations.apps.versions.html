<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="restore">restore(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Restores the specified app version. This will create a new app version from the current draft app and overwrite the current draft with the specified app version.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the app version to restore. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for AgentService.RestoreAppVersion
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
