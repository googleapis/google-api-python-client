<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#batchDelete">batchDelete(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Deletes a list of Photos and their metadata. Note that if BatchDeletePhotos fails, either critical fields are missing or there is an authentication error. Even if BatchDeletePhotos succeeds, individual photos in the batch may have failures. These failures are specified in each PhotoResponse.status in BatchDeletePhotosResponse.results. See DeletePhoto for specific failures that can occur per photo.</p>

  <pre>Lists all the Photos that belong to the user. *Note:* Recently created photos that are still being indexed are not returned in the response.

Args:
  filter: string, Required. The filter expression. For example: `placeId=ChIJj61dQgK6j4AR4GeTYWZsKWw`. The only filter supported at the moment is `placeId`.
  languageCode: string, The BCP-47 language code, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier. If language_code is unspecified, the user&#x27;s language preference for Google services is used.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of photos to return. `pageSize` must be non-negative. If `pageSize` is zero or is not provided, the default page size of 100 is used. The number of photos returned in the response may be less than `pageSize` if the number of photos that belong to the user is less than `pageSize`.
  pageToken: string, The nextPageToken value returned from a previous ListPhotos request, if any.
  view: string, Required. Specifies if a download URL for the photos bytes should be returned in the Photos response.
    Allowed values

      INCLUDE_DOWNLOAD_URL - Server responses include the download URL for the photo bytes.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
