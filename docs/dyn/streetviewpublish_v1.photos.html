  <pre>Lists all the Photos that belong to the user. &gt; Note: Recently created photos that are still being indexed are not returned in the response.

Args:
  filter: string, Optional. The filter expression. For example: `placeId=ChIJj61dQgK6j4AR4GeTYWZsKWw`. The filters supported are: `placeId`, `min_latitude`, `max_latitude`, `min_longitude`, and `max_longitude`. See https://google.aip.dev/160 for more information.
  languageCode: string, Optional. The BCP-47 language code, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_locale_identifier. If language_code is unspecified, the user&#x27;s language preference for Google services is used.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of photos to return. `pageSize` must be non-negative. If `pageSize` is zero or is not provided, the default page size of 100 is used. The number of photos returned in the response may be less than `pageSize` if the number of photos that belong to the user is less than `pageSize`.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The nextPageToken value returned from a previous ListPhotos request, if any.
  view: string, Required. Specifies if a download URL for the photos bytes should be returned in the Photos response.
    Allowed values
      BASIC - Server responses do not include the download URL for the photo bytes. The default value.
      INCLUDE_DOWNLOAD_URL - Server responses include the download URL for the photo bytes.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
