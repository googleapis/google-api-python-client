<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a logs-based metric.

Args:
  parent: string, The resource name of the project in which to create the metric:
"projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
The new metric must be provided in the request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Describes a logs-based metric. The value of the metric is the number of log entries that match a logs filter in a given time interval.
    "filter": "A String", # Required. An advanced logs filter which is used to match log entries. Example:
        # "resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR"
        # The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters.
    "version": "A String", # Output only. The API version that created or updated this metric. The version also dictates the syntax of the filter expression. When a value for this field is missing, the default value of V2 should be assumed.
    "name": "A String", # Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples: "error_count", "nginx/requests".Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!*',()%/. The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.The metric identifier in this field must not be URL-encoded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). However, when the metric identifier appears as the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric_name API parameter, then the metric identifier must be URL-encoded. Example: "projects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests".
    "description": "A String", # Optional. A description of this metric, which is used in documentation.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      # service Foo {
      #   rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      # }
