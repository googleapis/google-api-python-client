  <pre>Gets the Logs Router CMEK settings for the given resource.Note: CMEK for the Logs Router can currently only be configured for GCP organizations. Once configured, it applies to all projects and folders in the GCP organization.See Enabling CMEK for Logs Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource for which to retrieve CMEK settings.
&quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/cmekSettings&quot;
&quot;organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/cmekSettings&quot;
&quot;billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/cmekSettings&quot;
&quot;folders/[FOLDER_ID]/cmekSettings&quot;
Example: &quot;organizations/12345/cmekSettings&quot;.Note: CMEK for the Logs Router can currently only be configured for GCP organizations. Once configured, it applies to all projects and folders in the GCP organization. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Describes the customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) settings associated with a project, folder, organization, billing account, or flexible resource.Note: CMEK for the Logs Router can currently only be configured for GCP organizations. Once configured, it applies to all projects and folders in the GCP organization.See Enabling CMEK for Logs Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.
    &quot;serviceAccountId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The service account that will be used by the Logs Router to access your Cloud KMS key.Before enabling CMEK for Logs Router, you must first assign the role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter to the service account that the Logs Router will use to access your Cloud KMS key. Use GetCmekSettings to obtain the service account ID.See Enabling CMEK for Logs Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.

Encryption operations that are in progress will be completed with the key that was in use when they started. Decryption operations will be completed using the key that was used at the time of encryption unless access to that key has been revoked.To disable CMEK for the Logs Router, set this field to an empty string.See Enabling CMEK for Logs Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.
