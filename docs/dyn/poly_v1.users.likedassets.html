<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(name, orderBy=None, format=None, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists assets that the user has liked. Only the value &#x27;me&#x27;, representing
the currently-authenticated user, is supported. May include assets with an
access level of UNLISTED.

Args:
  name: string, A valid user id. Currently, only the special value &#x27;me&#x27;, representing the
currently-authenticated user is supported. To use &#x27;me&#x27;, you must pass
an OAuth token with the request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Specifies an ordering for assets. Acceptable values are:
`BEST`, `NEWEST`, `OLDEST`, &#x27;LIKED_TIME&#x27;. Defaults to `LIKED_TIME`, which
ranks assets based on how recently they were liked.
  format: string, Return only assets with the matching format. Acceptable values are:
`BLOCKS`, `FBX`, `GLTF`, `GLTF2`, `OBJ`, `TILT`.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a continuation token from a previous search whose results were
split into multiple pages. To get the next page, submit the same request
specifying the value from
next_page_token.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of assets to be returned. This value must be between `1`
and `100`. Defaults to `20`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
