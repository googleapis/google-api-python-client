<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(projectId, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a History.

The returned History will have the id set.

May return any of the following canonical error codes:

- PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to write to project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - NOT_FOUND - if the containing project does not exist

Args:
  projectId: string, A Project id.

Required. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A History represents a sorted list of Executions ordered by the start_timestamp_millis field (descending). It can be used to group all the Executions of a continuous build.
      # 
      # Note that the ordering only operates on one-dimension. If a repository has multiple branches, it means that multiple histories will need to be used in order to order Executions per branch.
    "displayName": "A String", # A short human-readable (plain text) name to display in the UI. Maximum of 100 characters.
        # 
        # - In response: present if set during create. - In create request: optional
    "name": "A String", # A name to uniquely identify a history within a project. Maximum of 200 characters.
        # 
        # - In response always set - In create request: always set
    "historyId": "A String", # A unique identifier within a project for this History.
        # 
        # Returns INVALID_ARGUMENT if this field is set or overwritten by the caller.
        # 
        # - In response always set - In create request: never set
  }

  requestId: string, A unique request ID for server to detect duplicated requests. For example, a UUID.

Optional, but strongly recommended.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(projectId, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, filterByName=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Histories for a given Project.

The histories are sorted by modification time in descending order. The history_id key will be used to order the history with the same modification time.

May return any of the following canonical error codes:

- PERMISSION_DENIED - if the user is not authorized to read project - INVALID_ARGUMENT - if the request is malformed - NOT_FOUND - if the History does not exist

Args:
  projectId: string, A Project id.

Required. (required)
  pageToken: string, A continuation token to resume the query at the next item.

Optional.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of Histories to fetch.

Default value: 20. The server will use this default if the field is not set or has a value of 0. Any value greater than 100 will be treated as 100.

Optional.
  filterByName: string, If set, only return histories with the given name.

Optional.

Returns:

        #
        # Will only be set if there are more histories to fetch.
        #
        # Tokens are valid for up to one hour from the time of the first list request. For instance, if you make a list request at 1PM and use the token from this first request 10 minutes later, the token from this second response will only be valid for 50 minutes.
