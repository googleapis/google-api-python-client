  <pre>Cancels a CustomJob. Starts asynchronous cancellation on the CustomJob. The server makes a best effort to cancel the job, but success is not guaranteed. Clients can use JobService.GetCustomJob or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the job completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the CustomJob is not deleted; instead it becomes a job with a CustomJob.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`, and CustomJob.state is set to `CANCELLED`.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the CustomJob to cancel. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/customJobs/{custom_job}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for JobService.CancelCustomJob.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
