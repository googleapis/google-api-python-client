            &quot;audio&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The natural language speech audio to be processed. A single request can contain up to 1 minute of speech audio data. The transcribed text cannot contain more than 256 bytes. For non-streaming audio detect intent, both `config` and `audio` must be provided. For streaming audio detect intent, `config` must be provided in the first request and `audio` must be provided in all following requests.

              &quot;enableWordInfo&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If `true`, Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech doesn&#x27;t return any word-level information.
              &quot;model&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Which Speech model to select for the given request. Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters in the InputAudioConfig. If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model.

              &quot;modelVariant&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Which variant of the Speech model to use.

              &quot;singleUtterance&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If `false` (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If `true`, the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio&#x27;s voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods.

At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page. For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational state represented by the page. For more information, see the [Page guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/page). # The Page on which the utterance was spoken. Only name and displayName will be set.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Fetches a list of results for a given test case.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The test case to list results for. Format: `projects//locations//agents// testCases/`. Specify a `-` as a wildcard for TestCase ID to list results across multiple test cases. (required)
  filter: string, The filter expression used to filter test case results. See [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160). The expression is case insensitive. Only &#x27;AND&#x27; is supported for logical operators. The supported syntax is listed below in detail: [AND ] ... [AND latest] The supported fields and operators are: field operator `environment` `=`, `IN` (Use value `draft` for draft environment) `test_time` `&gt;`, `&lt;` `latest` only returns the latest test result in all results for each test case. Examples: * &quot;environment=draft AND latest&quot; matches the latest test result for each test case in the draft environment. * &quot;environment IN (e1,e2)&quot; matches any test case results with an environment resource name of either &quot;e1&quot; or &quot;e2&quot;. * &quot;test_time &gt; 1602540713&quot; matches any test case results with test time later than a unix timestamp in seconds 1602540713.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Response error from the agent in the test result. If set, other output is empty.

Adding training phrases to fallback intent is useful in the case of requests that are mistakenly matched, since training phrases assigned to fallback intents act as negative examples that triggers no-match event.

Prefix &quot;sys.&quot; is reserved for Dialogflow defined labels. Currently allowed Dialogflow defined labels include: * sys.head * sys.contextual The above labels do not require value. &quot;sys.head&quot; means the intent is a head intent. &quot;sys.contextual&quot; means the intent is a contextual intent.

Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `parameter_id` field is set.
