  <pre>Lists `Occurrences` referencing the specified `Note`. Use this method to get all occurrences referencing your `Note` across all your customer projects.

Args:
  name: string, The name field will contain the note name for example: &quot;provider/{provider_id}/notes/{note_id}&quot; (required)
  filter: string, The filter expression.
  pageSize: integer, Number of notes to return in the list.
  pageToken: string, Token to provide to skip to a particular spot in the list.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response including listed occurrences for a note.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Token to receive the next page of notes.
  &quot;occurrences&quot;: [ # The occurrences attached to the specified note.
    { # `Occurrence` includes information about analysis occurrences for an image.
      &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an Attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the AttestationAuthority to which this Attestation is attached is primarily useful for look-up (how to find this Attestation if you already know the Authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (which authority was this attestation intended to sign for). # Describes an attestation of an artifact.
        &quot;pgpSignedAttestation&quot;: { # An attestation wrapper with a PGP-compatible signature. This message only supports `ATTACHED` signatures, where the payload that is signed is included alongside the signature itself in the same file.
          &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Type (for example schema) of the attestation payload that was signed. The verifier must ensure that the provided type is one that the verifier supports, and that the attestation payload is a valid instantiation of that type (for example by validating a JSON schema).
          &quot;pgpKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The cryptographic fingerprint of the key used to generate the signature, as output by, e.g. `gpg --list-keys`. This should be the version 4, full 160-bit fingerprint, expressed as a 40 character hexadecimal string. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-12.2 for details. Implementations may choose to acknowledge &quot;LONG&quot;, &quot;SHORT&quot;, or other abbreviated key IDs, but only the full fingerprint is guaranteed to work. In gpg, the full fingerprint can be retrieved from the `fpr` field returned when calling --list-keys with --with-colons. For example: ``` gpg --with-colons --with-fingerprint --force-v4-certs \ --list-keys attester@example.com tru::1:1513631572:0:3:1:5 pub:...... fpr:::::::::24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB: ``` Above, the fingerprint is `24FF6481B76AC91E66A00AC657A93A81EF3AE6FB`.
          &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The raw content of the signature, as output by GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) or equivalent. Since this message only supports attached signatures, the payload that was signed must be attached. While the signature format supported is dependent on the verification implementation, currently only ASCII-armored (`--armor` to gpg), non-clearsigned (`--sign` rather than `--clearsign` to gpg) are supported. Concretely, `gpg --sign --armor --output=signature.gpg payload.json` will create the signature content expected in this field in `signature.gpg` for the `payload.json` attestation payload.
