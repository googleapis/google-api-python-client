<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(name, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, pageSize=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists `Occurrences` referencing the specified `Note`. Use this method to
get all occurrences referencing your `Note` across all your customer
projects.

Args:
  name: string, The name field will contain the note name for example:
  "provider/{provider_id}/notes/{note_id}" (required)
  pageToken: string, Token to provide to skip to a particular spot in the list.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  pageSize: integer, Number of notes to return in the list.
  filter: string, The filter expression.

Returns:
