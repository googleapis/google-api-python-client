  <code><a href="#checkCompatibility">checkCompatibility(property, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">This compatibility method lists dimensions and metrics that can be added to a report request and maintain compatibility. This method fails if the request's dimensions and metrics are incompatible. In Google Analytics, reports fail if they request incompatible dimensions and/or metrics; in that case, you will need to remove dimensions and/or metrics from the incompatible report until the report is compatible. The Realtime and Core reports have different compatibility rules. This method checks compatibility for Core reports.</p>

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#getMetadata">getMetadata(name, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns metadata for dimensions and metrics available in reporting methods. Used to explore the dimensions and metrics. In this method, a Google Analytics GA4 Property Identifier is specified in the request, and the metadata response includes Custom dimensions and metrics as well as Universal metadata. For example if a custom metric with parameter name `levels_unlocked` is registered to a property, the Metadata response will contain `customEvent:levels_unlocked`. Universal metadata are dimensions and metrics applicable to any property such as `country` and `totalUsers`.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#runPivotReport">runPivotReport(property, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns a customized pivot report of your Google Analytics event data. Pivot reports are more advanced and expressive formats than regular reports. In a pivot report, dimensions are only visible if they are included in a pivot. Multiple pivots can be specified to further dissect your data.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#runRealtimeReport">runRealtimeReport(property, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns a customized report of realtime event data for your property. Events appear in realtime reports seconds after they have been sent to the Google Analytics. Realtime reports show events and usage data for the periods of time ranging from the present moment to 30 minutes ago (up to 60 minutes for Google Analytics 360 properties).

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#runReport">runReport(property, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns a customized report of your Google Analytics event data. Reports contain statistics derived from data collected by the Google Analytics tracking code. The data returned from the API is as a table with columns for the requested dimensions and metrics. Metrics are individual measurements of user activity on your property, such as active users or event count. Dimensions break down metrics across some common criteria, such as country or event name.

<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchRunPivotReports">batchRunPivotReports(property, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns multiple pivot reports in a batch. All reports must be for the same GA4 Property.

Args:
  property: string, A Google Analytics GA4 property identifier whose events are tracked. Specified in the URL path and not the body. To learn more, see [where to find your Property ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id). This property must be specified for the batch. The property within RunPivotReportRequest may either be unspecified or consistent with this property. Example: properties/1234 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The batch request containing multiple pivot report requests.
  &quot;requests&quot;: [ # Individual requests. Each request has a separate pivot report response. Each batch request is allowed up to 5 requests.
    { # The request to generate a pivot report.
      &quot;cohortSpec&quot;: { # The specification of cohorts for a cohort report. Cohort reports create a time series of user retention for the cohort. For example, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report. # Cohort group associated with this request. If there is a cohort group in the request the &#x27;cohort&#x27; dimension must be present.
        &quot;cohortReportSettings&quot;: { # Optional settings of a cohort report. # Optional settings for a cohort report.

          { # Defines a cohort selection criteria. A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic. For example, users with the same `firstSessionDate` belong to the same cohort.
            &quot;dateRange&quot;: { # A contiguous set of days: startDate, startDate + 1, ..., endDate. Requests are allowed up to 4 date ranges. # The cohort selects users whose first touch date is between start date and end date defined in the `dateRange`. This `dateRange` does not specify the full date range of event data that is present in a cohort report. In a cohort report, this `dateRange` is extended by the granularity and offset present in the `cohortsRange`; event data for the extended reporting date range is present in a cohort report. In a cohort request, this `dateRange` is required and the `dateRanges` in the `RunReportRequest` or `RunPivotReportRequest` must be unspecified. This `dateRange` should generally be aligned with the cohort&#x27;s granularity. If `CohortsRange` uses daily granularity, this `dateRange` can be a single day. If `CohortsRange` uses weekly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday. If `CohortsRange` uses monthly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a month, starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month.

Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report. # Cohort group associated with this request.

  <pre>This compatibility method lists dimensions and metrics that can be added to a report request and maintain compatibility. This method fails if the request&#x27;s dimensions and metrics are incompatible. In Google Analytics, reports fail if they request incompatible dimensions and/or metrics; in that case, you will need to remove dimensions and/or metrics from the incompatible report until the report is compatible. The Realtime and Core reports have different compatibility rules. This method checks compatibility for Core reports.

Args:
  property: string, A Google Analytics GA4 property identifier whose events are tracked. To learn more, see [where to find your Property ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id). `property` should be the same value as in your `runReport` request. Example: properties/1234 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  <pre>Returns a customized pivot report of your Google Analytics event data. Pivot reports are more advanced and expressive formats than regular reports. In a pivot report, dimensions are only visible if they are included in a pivot. Multiple pivots can be specified to further dissect your data.

Args:
  property: string, A Google Analytics GA4 property identifier whose events are tracked. Specified in the URL path and not the body. To learn more, see [where to find your Property ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id). Within a batch request, this property should either be unspecified or consistent with the batch-level property. Example: properties/1234 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request to generate a pivot report.
  &quot;cohortSpec&quot;: { # The specification of cohorts for a cohort report. Cohort reports create a time series of user retention for the cohort. For example, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report. # Cohort group associated with this request. If there is a cohort group in the request the &#x27;cohort&#x27; dimension must be present.
    &quot;cohortReportSettings&quot;: { # Optional settings of a cohort report. # Optional settings for a cohort report.
      &quot;accumulate&quot;: True or False, # If true, accumulates the result from first touch day to the end day. Not supported in `RunReportRequest`.
    },
    &quot;cohorts&quot;: [ # Defines the selection criteria to group users into cohorts. Most cohort reports define only a single cohort. If multiple cohorts are specified, each cohort can be recognized in the report by their name.
      { # Defines a cohort selection criteria. A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic. For example, users with the same `firstSessionDate` belong to the same cohort.
        &quot;dateRange&quot;: { # A contiguous set of days: startDate, startDate + 1, ..., endDate. Requests are allowed up to 4 date ranges. # The cohort selects users whose first touch date is between start date and end date defined in the `dateRange`. This `dateRange` does not specify the full date range of event data that is present in a cohort report. In a cohort report, this `dateRange` is extended by the granularity and offset present in the `cohortsRange`; event data for the extended reporting date range is present in a cohort report. In a cohort request, this `dateRange` is required and the `dateRanges` in the `RunReportRequest` or `RunPivotReportRequest` must be unspecified. This `dateRange` should generally be aligned with the cohort&#x27;s granularity. If `CohortsRange` uses daily granularity, this `dateRange` can be a single day. If `CohortsRange` uses weekly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday. If `CohortsRange` uses monthly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a month, starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month.

If `granularity` is `DAILY`, the `endDate` of the extended reporting date range is `endDate` of the cohort plus `endOffset` days. If `granularity` is `WEEKLY`, the `endDate` of the extended reporting date range is `endDate` of the cohort plus `endOffset * 7` days.

      &quot;granularity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The granularity used to interpret the `startOffset` and `endOffset` for the extended reporting date range for a cohort report.
      &quot;startOffset&quot;: 42, # `startOffset` specifies the start date of the extended reporting date range for a cohort report. `startOffset` is commonly set to 0 so that reports contain data from the acquisition of the cohort forward. If `granularity` is `DAILY`, the `startDate` of the extended reporting date range is `startDate` of the cohort plus `startOffset` days. If `granularity` is `WEEKLY`, the `startDate` of the extended reporting date range is `startDate` of the cohort plus `startOffset * 7` days. If `granularity` is `MONTHLY`, the `startDate` of the extended reporting date range is `startDate` of the cohort plus `startOffset * 30` days.

  <pre>Returns a customized report of your Google Analytics event data. Reports contain statistics derived from data collected by the Google Analytics tracking code. The data returned from the API is as a table with columns for the requested dimensions and metrics. Metrics are individual measurements of user activity on your property, such as active users or event count. Dimensions break down metrics across some common criteria, such as country or event name. For a guide to constructing requests &amp; understanding responses, see [Creating a Report](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics).

Args:
  property: string, A Google Analytics GA4 property identifier whose events are tracked. Specified in the URL path and not the body. To learn more, see [where to find your Property ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id). Within a batch request, this property should either be unspecified or consistent with the batch-level property. Example: properties/1234 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request to generate a report.
  &quot;cohortSpec&quot;: { # The specification of cohorts for a cohort report. Cohort reports create a time series of user retention for the cohort. For example, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report. # Cohort group associated with this request. If there is a cohort group in the request the &#x27;cohort&#x27; dimension must be present.
    &quot;cohortReportSettings&quot;: { # Optional settings of a cohort report. # Optional settings for a cohort report.
      &quot;accumulate&quot;: True or False, # If true, accumulates the result from first touch day to the end day. Not supported in `RunReportRequest`.
    },
    &quot;cohorts&quot;: [ # Defines the selection criteria to group users into cohorts. Most cohort reports define only a single cohort. If multiple cohorts are specified, each cohort can be recognized in the report by their name.
      { # Defines a cohort selection criteria. A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic. For example, users with the same `firstSessionDate` belong to the same cohort.
        &quot;dateRange&quot;: { # A contiguous set of days: startDate, startDate + 1, ..., endDate. Requests are allowed up to 4 date ranges. # The cohort selects users whose first touch date is between start date and end date defined in the `dateRange`. This `dateRange` does not specify the full date range of event data that is present in a cohort report. In a cohort report, this `dateRange` is extended by the granularity and offset present in the `cohortsRange`; event data for the extended reporting date range is present in a cohort report. In a cohort request, this `dateRange` is required and the `dateRanges` in the `RunReportRequest` or `RunPivotReportRequest` must be unspecified. This `dateRange` should generally be aligned with the cohort&#x27;s granularity. If `CohortsRange` uses daily granularity, this `dateRange` can be a single day. If `CohortsRange` uses weekly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday. If `CohortsRange` uses monthly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a month, starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month.

If `granularity` is `DAILY`, the `endDate` of the extended reporting date range is `endDate` of the cohort plus `endOffset` days. If `granularity` is `WEEKLY`, the `endDate` of the extended reporting date range is `endDate` of the cohort plus `endOffset * 7` days.

      &quot;startOffset&quot;: 42, # `startOffset` specifies the start date of the extended reporting date range for a cohort report. `startOffset` is commonly set to 0 so that reports contain data from the acquisition of the cohort forward. If `granularity` is `DAILY`, the `startDate` of the extended reporting date range is `startDate` of the cohort plus `startOffset` days. If `granularity` is `WEEKLY`, the `startDate` of the extended reporting date range is `startDate` of the cohort plus `startOffset * 7` days.
