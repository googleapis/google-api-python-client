  <code><a href="#action">action(customerId, resourceId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Takes an action that affects a Chrome OS Device. This includes deprovisioning, disabling, and re-enabling devices. *Warning:* * Deprovisioning a device will stop device policy syncing and remove device-level printers. After a device is deprovisioned, it must be wiped before it can be re-enrolled. * Lost or stolen devices should use the disable action. * Re-enabling a disabled device will consume a device license. If you do not have sufficient licenses available when completing the re-enable action, you will receive an error.

  <pre>Updates a device&#x27;s updatable properties, such as `annotatedUser`, `annotatedLocation`, `notes`, `orgUnitPath`, or `annotatedAssetId`.

Args:
  customerId: string, The unique ID for the customer&#x27;s Google Workspace account.
