<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#cancel">cancel(name, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to Code.CANCELLED.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Deletes a long-running operation. This method indicates that the client is no longer interested in the operation result. It does not cancel the operation. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.</p>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#list">list(name, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, pageSize=None, filter=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns UNIMPLEMENTED.NOTE: the name binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as users/*/operations. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as "/v1/{name=users/*}/operations" to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.</p>

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking.

    <code class="details" id="cancel">cancel(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for TestIamPermissions method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the resource. Permissions with wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more information see IAM Overview (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for TestIamPermissions method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of TestPermissionsRequest.permissions that the caller is allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
  }</pre>
