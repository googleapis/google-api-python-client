Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the model. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a version of the model. Each version is a trained model deployed in the cloud, ready to handle prediction requests. A model can have multiple versions. You can get information about all of the versions of a given model by calling projects.models.versions.list.
  &quot;acceleratorConfig&quot;: { # Represents a hardware accelerator request config. Note that the AcceleratorConfig can be used in both Jobs and Versions. Learn more about [accelerators for training](/ml-engine/docs/using-gpus) and [accelerators for online prediction](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction#gpus). # Optional. Accelerator config for using GPUs for online prediction (beta). Only specify this field if you have specified a Compute Engine (N1) machine type in the `machineType` field. Learn more about [using GPUs for online prediction](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction#gpus).
    &quot;count&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The number of accelerators to attach to each machine running the job.
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of accelerator to use.
  },
  &quot;autoScaling&quot;: { # Options for automatically scaling a model. # Automatically scale the number of nodes used to serve the model in response to increases and decreases in traffic. Care should be taken to ramp up traffic according to the model&#x27;s ability to scale or you will start seeing increases in latency and 429 response codes.
    &quot;maxNodes&quot;: 42, # The maximum number of nodes to scale this model under load. The actual value will depend on resource quota and availability.
    &quot;metrics&quot;: [ # MetricSpec contains the specifications to use to calculate the desired nodes count.
      { # MetricSpec contains the specifications to use to calculate the desired nodes count when autoscaling is enabled.

        &quot;target&quot;: 42, # Target specifies the target value for the given metric; once real metric deviates from the threshold by a certain percentage, the node count changes.
      },
    ],
    &quot;minNodes&quot;: 42, # Optional. The minimum number of nodes to allocate for this model. These nodes are always up, starting from the time the model is deployed. Therefore, the cost of operating this model will be at least `rate` * `min_nodes` * number of hours since last billing cycle, where `rate` is the cost per node-hour as documented in the [pricing guide](/ml-engine/docs/pricing), even if no predictions are performed. There is additional cost for each prediction performed. Unlike manual scaling, if the load gets too heavy for the nodes that are up, the service will automatically add nodes to handle the increased load as well as scale back as traffic drops, always maintaining at least `min_nodes`. You will be charged for the time in which additional nodes are used. If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [legacy (MLS1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 0, in which case, when traffic to a model stops (and after a cool-down period), nodes will be shut down and no charges will be incurred until traffic to the model resumes. If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [Compute Engine (N1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 1. `min_nodes` must be at least 1 for use with a Compute Engine machine type. You can set `min_nodes` when creating the model version, and you can also update `min_nodes` for an existing version: update_body.json: { &#x27;autoScaling&#x27;: { &#x27;minNodes&#x27;: 5 } } HTTP request: PATCH https://ml.googleapis.com/v1/{name=projects/*/models/*/versions/*}?update_mask=autoScaling.minNodes -d @./update_body.json

For example, if you are using the `us-central1-ml.googleapis.com` endpoint, then this URI must begin with `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev`. To use a custom container, the [AI Platform Google-managed service account](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/custom-service-account#default) must have permission to pull (read) the Docker image at this URI. The AI Platform Google-managed service account has the following format: `service-{PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloud-ml.google.com.iam.gserviceaccount.com` {PROJECT_NUMBER} is replaced by your Google Cloud project number. By default, this service account has necessary permissions to pull an Artifact Registry image in the same Google Cloud project where you are using AI Platform Prediction.

Setting up continuous evaluation automatically enables logging of request-response pairs. # Optional. *Only* specify this field in a projects.models.versions.patch request. Specifying it in a projects.models.versions.create request has no effect. Configures the request-response pair logging on predictions from this Version.
    &quot;bigqueryTableName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Fully qualified BigQuery table name in the following format: &quot; project_id.dataset_name.table_name&quot; The specified table must already exist, and the &quot;Cloud ML Service Agent&quot; for your project must have permission to write to it. The table must have the following [schema](/bigquery/docs/schemas): Field nameType Mode model STRING REQUIRED model_version STRING REQUIRED time TIMESTAMP REQUIRED raw_data STRING REQUIRED raw_prediction STRING NULLABLE groundtruth STRING NULLABLE
    &quot;samplingPercentage&quot;: 3.14, # Percentage of requests to be logged, expressed as a fraction from 0 to 1. For example, if you want to log 10% of requests, enter `0.1`. The sampling window is the lifetime of the model version. Defaults to 0.
  },
  &quot;routes&quot;: { # Specifies HTTP paths served by a custom container. AI Platform Prediction sends requests to these paths on the container; the custom container must run an HTTP server that responds to these requests with appropriate responses. Read [Custom container requirements](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/custom-container-requirements) for details on how to create your container image to meet these requirements. # Optional. Specifies paths on a custom container&#x27;s HTTP server where AI Platform Prediction sends certain requests. If you specify this field, then you must also specify the `container` field. If you specify the `container` field and do not specify this field, it defaults to the following: ```json { &quot;predict&quot;: &quot;/v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION:predict&quot;, &quot;health&quot;: &quot;/v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION&quot; } ``` See RouteMap for more details about these default values.
    &quot;health&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # HTTP path on the container to send health checkss to. AI Platform Prediction intermittently sends GET requests to this path on the container&#x27;s IP address and port to check that the container is healthy. Read more about [health checks](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/custom-container-requirements#checks). For example, if you set this field to `/bar`, then AI Platform Prediction intermittently sends a GET request to the `/bar` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of Version.container.ports. If you don&#x27;t specify this field, it defaults to the following value: /v1/models/ MODEL/versions/VERSION The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * MODEL: The name of the parent Model. This does not include the &quot;projects/PROJECT_ID/models/&quot; prefix that the API returns in output; it is the bare model name, as provided to projects.models.create. * VERSION: The name of the model version. This does not include the &quot;projects/PROJECT_ID /models/MODEL/versions/&quot; prefix that the API returns in output; it is the bare version name, as provided to projects.models.versions.create.
    &quot;predict&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # HTTP path on the container to send prediction requests to. AI Platform Prediction forwards requests sent using projects.predict to this path on the container&#x27;s IP address and port. AI Platform Prediction then returns the container&#x27;s response in the API response. For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when AI Platform Prediction receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of Version.container.ports. If you don&#x27;t specify this field, it defaults to the following value: /v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * MODEL: The name of the parent Model. This does not include the &quot;projects/PROJECT_ID/models/&quot; prefix that the API returns in output; it is the bare model name, as provided to projects.models.create. * VERSION: The name of the model version.

There is additional cost for each prediction performed. Unlike manual scaling, if the load gets too heavy for the nodes that are up, the service will automatically add nodes to handle the increased load as well as scale back as traffic drops, always maintaining at least `min_nodes`. You will be charged for the time in which additional nodes are used. If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [legacy (MLS1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 0, in which case, when traffic to a model stops (and after a cool-down period), nodes will be shut down and no charges will be incurred until traffic to the model resumes.

Online prediction requests to a model version and the responses to these requests are converted to raw strings and saved to the specified BigQuery table. Logging is constrained by [BigQuery quotas and limits](/bigquery/quotas). If your project exceeds BigQuery quotas or limits, AI Platform Prediction does not log request-response pairs, but it continues to serve predictions. If you are using [continuous evaluation](/ml-engine/docs/continuous-evaluation/), you do not need to specify this configuration manually. Setting up continuous evaluation automatically enables logging of request-response pairs. # Optional. *Only* specify this field in a projects.models.versions.patch request.

Specifies paths on a custom container&#x27;s HTTP server where AI Platform Prediction sends certain requests. If you specify this field, then you must also specify the `container` field. If you specify the `container` field and do not specify this field, it defaults to the following: ```json { &quot;predict&quot;: &quot;/v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION:predict&quot;, &quot;health&quot;: &quot;/v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION&quot; } ``` See RouteMap for more details about these default values.

For example, if you set this field to `/bar`, then AI Platform Prediction intermittently sends a GET request to the `/bar` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of Version.container.ports. If you don&#x27;t specify this field, it defaults to the following value: /v1/models/ MODEL/versions/VERSION The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * MODEL: The name of the parent Model.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets basic information about all the versions of a model. If you expect that a model has many versions, or if you need to handle only a limited number of results at a time, you can request that the list be retrieved in batches (called pages). If there are no versions that match the request parameters, the list request returns an empty response body: {}.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the model for which to list the version. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Specifies the subset of versions to retrieve.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The number of versions to retrieve per &quot;page&quot; of results. If there are more remaining results than this number, the response message will contain a valid value in the `next_page_token` field. The default value is 20, and the maximum page size is 100.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token to request the next page of results. You get the token from the `next_page_token` field of the response from the previous call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

        &quot;minNodes&quot;: 42, # Optional. The minimum number of nodes to allocate for this model. These nodes are always up, starting from the time the model is deployed. Therefore, the cost of operating this model will be at least `rate` * `min_nodes` * number of hours since last billing cycle, where `rate` is the cost per node-hour as documented in the [pricing guide](/ml-engine/docs/pricing), even if no predictions are performed. There is additional cost for each prediction performed. Unlike manual scaling, if the load gets too heavy for the nodes that are up, the service will automatically add nodes to handle the increased load as well as scale back as traffic drops, always maintaining at least `min_nodes`. You will be charged for the time in which additional nodes are used. If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [legacy (MLS1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 0, in which case, when traffic to a model stops (and after a cool-down period), nodes will be shut down and no charges will be incurred until traffic to the model resumes. If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [Compute Engine (N1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 1. `min_nodes` must be at least 1 for use with a Compute Engine machine type. You can set `min_nodes` when creating the model version, and you can also update `min_nodes` for an existing version: update_body.json: { &#x27;autoScaling&#x27;: { &#x27;minNodes&#x27;: 5 } } HTTP request: PATCH https://ml.googleapis.com/v1/{name=projects/*/models/*/versions/*}?update_mask=autoScaling.minNodes -d @./update_body.json

Online prediction requests to a model version and the responses to these requests are converted to raw strings and saved to the specified BigQuery table. Logging is constrained by [BigQuery quotas and limits](/bigquery/quotas). If your project exceeds BigQuery quotas or limits, AI Platform Prediction does not log request-response pairs, but it continues to serve predictions. If you are using [continuous evaluation](/ml-engine/docs/continuous-evaluation/), you do not need to specify this configuration manually. Setting up continuous evaluation automatically enables logging of request-response pairs. # Optional. *Only* specify this field in a projects.models.versions.patch request. Specifying it in a projects.models.versions.create request has no effect. Configures the request-response pair logging on predictions from this Version.

Read [Custom container requirements](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/custom-container-requirements) for details on how to create your container image to meet these requirements. # Optional. Specifies paths on a custom container&#x27;s HTTP server where AI Platform Prediction sends certain requests. If you specify this field, then you must also specify the `container` field. If you specify the `container` field and do not specify this field, it defaults to the following: ```json { &quot;predict&quot;: &quot;/v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION:predict&quot;, &quot;health&quot;: &quot;/v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION&quot; } ``` See RouteMap for more details about these default values.

AI Platform Prediction intermittently sends GET requests to this path on the container&#x27;s IP address and port to check that the container is healthy. Read more about [health checks](/ai-platform/prediction/docs/custom-container-requirements#checks). For example, if you set this field to `/bar`, then AI Platform Prediction intermittently sends a GET request to the `/bar` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of Version.container.ports. If you don&#x27;t specify this field, it defaults to the following value: /v1/models/ MODEL/versions/VERSION The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * MODEL: The name of the parent Model.

AI Platform Prediction forwards requests sent using projects.predict to this path on the container&#x27;s IP address and port. AI Platform Prediction then returns the container&#x27;s response in the API response. For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when AI Platform Prediction receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of Version.container.ports. If you don&#x27;t specify this field, it defaults to the following value: /v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * MODEL: The name of the parent Model.

    &quot;minNodes&quot;: 42, # Optional. The minimum number of nodes to allocate for this model. These nodes are always up, starting from the time the model is deployed. Therefore, the cost of operating this model will be at least `rate` * `min_nodes` * number of hours since last billing cycle, where `rate` is the cost per node-hour as documented in the [pricing guide](/ml-engine/docs/pricing), even if no predictions are performed. There is additional cost for each prediction performed. Unlike manual scaling, if the load gets too heavy for the nodes that are up, the service will automatically add nodes to handle the increased load as well as scale back as traffic drops, always maintaining at least `min_nodes`. You will be charged for the time in which additional nodes are used. If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [legacy (MLS1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 0, in which case, when traffic to a model stops (and after a cool-down period), nodes will be shut down and no charges will be incurred until traffic to the model resumes. If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [Compute Engine (N1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction), `min_nodes` defaults to 1. `min_nodes` must be at least 1 for use with a Compute Engine machine type. You can set `min_nodes` when creating the model version, and you can also update `min_nodes` for an existing version: update_body.json: { &#x27;autoScaling&#x27;: { &#x27;minNodes&#x27;: 5 } } HTTP request: PATCH https://ml.googleapis.com/v1/{name=projects/*/models/*/versions/*}?update_mask=autoScaling.minNodes -d @./update_body.json

Online prediction requests to a model version and the responses to these requests are converted to raw strings and saved to the specified BigQuery table. Logging is constrained by [BigQuery quotas and limits](/bigquery/quotas). If your project exceeds BigQuery quotas or limits, AI Platform Prediction does not log request-response pairs, but it continues to serve predictions. If you are using [continuous evaluation](/ml-engine/docs/continuous-evaluation/), you do not need to specify this configuration manually. Setting up continuous evaluation automatically enables logging of request-response pairs. # Optional. *Only* specify this field in a projects.models.versions.patch request. Specifying it in a projects.models.versions.create request has no effect. Configures the request-response pair logging on predictions from this Version.

AI Platform Prediction forwards requests sent using projects.predict to this path on the container&#x27;s IP address and port. AI Platform Prediction then returns the container&#x27;s response in the API response. For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when AI Platform Prediction receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of Version.container.ports. If you don&#x27;t specify this field, it defaults to the following value: /v1/models/MODEL/versions/VERSION:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * MODEL: The name of the parent Model.
