  <pre>Creates a new version of a model from a trained TensorFlow model.

If the version created in the cloud by this call is the first deployed
version of the specified model, it will be made the default version of the
model. When you add a version to a model that already has one or more
versions, the default version does not automatically change. If you want a
new version to be the default, you must call
projects.models.versions.setDefault.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the model. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a version of the model.
    # 
    # Each version is a trained model deployed in the cloud, ready to handle
    # prediction requests. A model can have multiple versions. You can get

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, pageSize=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets basic information about all the versions of a model.

If you expect that a model has many versions, or if you need to handle
only a limited number of results at a time, you can request that the list
be retrieved in batches (called pages).

If there are no versions that match the request parameters, the list
request returns an empty response body: {}.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the model for which to list the version. (required)
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token to request the next page of results.

You get the token from the `next_page_token` field of the response from
the previous call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The number of versions to retrieve per "page" of results. If
there are more remaining results than this number, the response message
will contain a valid value in the `next_page_token` field.

The default value is 20, and the maximum page size is 100.
  filter: string, Optional. Specifies the subset of versions to retrieve.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for the ListVersions method.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # Optional. Pass this token as the `page_token` field of the request for a
        # subsequent call.

  updateMask: string, Required. Specifies the path, relative to `Version`, of the field to

```

  "description": "foo"

    "autoScaling": { # Options for automatically scaling a model. # Automatically scale the number of nodes used to serve the model in
        # response to increases and decreases in traffic. Care should be
        # taken to ramp up traffic according to the model's ability to scale
        # or you will start seeing increases in latency and 429 response codes.
        #
        # Note that you cannot use AutoScaling if your version uses
        # [GPUs](#Version.FIELDS.accelerator_config). Instead, you must use specify
        # `manual_scaling`.
      "minNodes": 42, # Optional. The minimum number of nodes to allocate for this model. These
          # nodes are always up, starting from the time the model is deployed.
          # Therefore, the cost of operating this model will be at least
          # `rate` * `min_nodes` * number of hours since last billing cycle,
          # where `rate` is the cost per node-hour as documented in the
          # [pricing guide](/ml-engine/docs/pricing),
          # even if no predictions are performed. There is additional cost for each
          # prediction performed.
          #
          # Unlike manual scaling, if the load gets too heavy for the nodes
          # that are up, the service will automatically add nodes to handle the
          # increased load as well as scale back as traffic drops, always maintaining
          # at least `min_nodes`. You will be charged for the time in which additional
          # nodes are used.
          #
          # If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [legacy
          # (MLS1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction),
          # `min_nodes` defaults to 0, in which case, when traffic to a model stops
          # (and after a cool-down period), nodes will be shut down and no charges will
          # be incurred until traffic to the model resumes.
          #
          # If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [Compute
          # Engine (N1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction),
          # `min_nodes` defaults to 1. `min_nodes` must be at least 1 for use with a
          # Compute Engine machine type.
          #
          # Note that you cannot use AutoScaling if your version uses
          # [GPUs](#Version.FIELDS.accelerator_config). Instead, you must use
          # ManualScaling.
          #
          # You can set `min_nodes` when creating the model version, and you can also
          # update `min_nodes` for an existing version:
