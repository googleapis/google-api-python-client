  <pre>Creates a new version of a model from a trained TensorFlow model.

If the version created in the cloud by this call is the first deployed
version of the specified model, it will be made the default version of the
model. When you add a version to a model that already has one or more
versions, the default version does not automatically change. If you want a
new version to be the default, you must call
projects.models.versions.setDefault.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the model. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a version of the model.
    # 
    # Each version is a trained model deployed in the cloud, ready to handle
    # prediction requests. A model can have multiple versions. You can get
    # information about all of the versions of a given model by calling
    # projects.models.versions.list.
  &quot;acceleratorConfig&quot;: { # Represents a hardware accelerator request config. # Optional. Accelerator config for using GPUs for online prediction (beta).
      # Only specify this field if you have specified a Compute Engine (N1) machine
      # type in the `machineType` field. Learn more about [using GPUs for online
      # prediction](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction#gpus).
      # Note that the AcceleratorConfig can be used in both Jobs and Versions.
      # Learn more about [accelerators for training](/ml-engine/docs/using-gpus) and
      # [accelerators for online
      # prediction](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction#gpus).
    &quot;count&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The number of accelerators to attach to each machine running the job.
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of accelerator to use.
  },

      # requests that do not specify a version.
      # 
      # You can change the default version by calling
      # projects.methods.versions.setDefault.
  &quot;manualScaling&quot;: { # Options for manually scaling a model. # Manually select the number of nodes to use for serving the
      # model. You should generally use `auto_scaling` with an appropriate
      # `min_nodes` instead, but this option is available if you want more
      # predictable billing. Beware that latency and error rates will increase
      # if the traffic exceeds that capability of the system to serve it based
      # on the selected number of nodes.
    &quot;nodes&quot;: 42, # The number of nodes to allocate for this model. These nodes are always up,
        # starting from the time the model is deployed, so the cost of operating
        # this model will be proportional to `nodes` * number of hours since
        # last billing cycle plus the cost for each prediction performed.
  },
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of a version.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name specified for the version when it was created.

      #   later.
      # * Python &#x27;3.5&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to a version

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, filter=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets basic information about all the versions of a model.

If you expect that a model has many versions, or if you need to handle
only a limited number of results at a time, you can request that the list
be retrieved in batches (called pages).

If there are no versions that match the request parameters, the list
request returns an empty response body: {}.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the model for which to list the version. (required)
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token to request the next page of results.

You get the token from the `next_page_token` field of the response from
the previous call.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The number of versions to retrieve per &quot;page&quot; of results. If
there are more remaining results than this number, the response message
will contain a valid value in the `next_page_token` field.

The default value is 20, and the maximum page size is 100.
  filter: string, Optional. Specifies the subset of versions to retrieve.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

        # `rate` * `min_nodes` * number of hours since last billing cycle,
        # where `rate` is the cost per node-hour as documented in the
        # [pricing guide](/ml-engine/docs/pricing),
        # even if no predictions are performed. There is additional cost for each
        # prediction performed.
        #
        # Unlike manual scaling, if the load gets too heavy for the nodes
        # that are up, the service will automatically add nodes to handle the
        # increased load as well as scale back as traffic drops, always maintaining
        # at least `min_nodes`. You will be charged for the time in which additional
        # nodes are used.

        # If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [legacy
        # (MLS1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction),
        # `min_nodes` defaults to 0, in which case, when traffic to a model stops
        # (and after a cool-down period), nodes will be shut down and no charges will
        # be incurred until traffic to the model resumes.
        #
        # If `min_nodes` is not specified and AutoScaling is used with a [Compute
        # Engine (N1) machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction),

  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The description specified for the version when it was created.
  &quot;framework&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The machine learning framework AI Platform uses to train
      # this version of the model. Valid values are `TENSORFLOW`, `SCIKIT_LEARN`,
      # `XGBOOST`. If you do not specify a framework, AI Platform

      # 
      # Do **not** specify a framework if you&#x27;re deploying a [custom
      # prediction routine](/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/custom-prediction-routines).
      # 
      # If you specify a [Compute Engine (N1) machine

      # `machineType` field, you must specify `TENSORFLOW`
      # for the framework.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      # prevent simultaneous updates of a model from overwriting each other.
      # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
      # read-modify-write cycle to perform model updates in order to avoid race
      # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetVersion`, and
      # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `UpdateVersion` to
      # ensure that their change will be applied to the model as intended.
}

  updateMask: string, Required. Specifies the path, relative to `Version`, of the field to
update. Must be present and non-empty.

For example, to change the description of a version to &quot;foo&quot;, the
`update_mask` parameter would be specified as `description`, and the
`PATCH` request body would specify the new value, as follows:

```
{
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;
}
```

Currently the only supported update mask fields are `description`,
`requestLoggingConfig`, `autoScaling.minNodes`, and `manualScaling.nodes`.
However, you can only update `manualScaling.nodes` if the version uses a
[Compute Engine (N1)
machine type](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction).
