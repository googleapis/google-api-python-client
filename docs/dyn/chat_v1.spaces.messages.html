Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the space in which to create a message. Format: `spaces/{space}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A message in a Google Chat space.
  &quot;accessoryWidgets&quot;: [ # One or more interactive widgets that appear at the bottom of a message. You can add accessory widgets to messages that contain text, cards, or both text and cards. Not supported for messages that contain dialogs. For details, see [Add interactive widgets at the bottom of a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#add-accessory-widgets). Creating a message with accessory widgets requires [app authentication] (https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app).
    { # One or more interactive widgets that appear at the bottom of a message. For details, see [Add interactive widgets at the bottom of a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#add-accessory-widgets).
      &quot;buttonList&quot;: { # A list of buttons layed out horizontally. For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a button](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-dialog#add_a_button). [Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend): # A list of buttons.
        &quot;buttons&quot;: [ # An array of buttons.
          { # A text, icon, or text and icon button that users can click. For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a button](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-dialog#add_a_button). To make an image a clickable button, specify an `Image` (not an `ImageComponent`) and set an `onClick` action. [Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend):
            &quot;altText&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The alternative text that&#x27;s used for accessibility. Set descriptive text that lets users know what the button does. For example, if a button opens a hyperlink, you might write: &quot;Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat&quot;.
            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background likely results in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green, and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that you can express in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255), or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
            },
            &quot;disabled&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, the button is displayed in an inactive state and doesn&#x27;t respond to user actions.
            &quot;icon&quot;: { # An icon displayed in a widget on a card.

[Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend): # The icon image. If both `icon` and `text` are set, then the icon appears before the text.
              &quot;altText&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of the icon used for accessibility. If unspecified, the default value `Button` is provided. As a best practice, you should set a helpful description for what the icon displays, and if applicable, what it does. For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat`. If the icon is set in a `Button`, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.
              &quot;iconUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Display a custom icon hosted at an HTTPS URL. For example: ``` &quot;iconUrl&quot;: &quot;https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/images/quickstart-app-avatar.png&quot; ``` Supported file types include `.png` and `.jpg`.

This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space.

}

  messageId: string, Optional. A custom ID for a message. Lets Chat apps get, update, or delete a message without needing to store the system-assigned ID in the message&#x27;s resource name (represented in the message `name` field). The value for this field must meet the following requirements: * Begins with `client-`. For example, `client-custom-name` is a valid custom ID, but `custom-name` is not. * Contains up to 63 characters and only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. * Is unique within a space. A Chat app can&#x27;t use the same custom ID for different messages. For details, see [Name a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#name_a_created_message).
  messageReplyOption: string, Optional. Specifies whether a message starts a thread or replies to one. Only supported in named spaces.
    Allowed values
      MESSAGE_REPLY_OPTION_UNSPECIFIED - Default. Starts a new thread. Using this option ignores any thread ID or `thread_key` that&#x27;s included.

      REPLY_MESSAGE_OR_FAIL - Creates the message as a reply to the thread specified by thread ID or `thread_key`. If a new `thread_key` is used, a new thread is created. If the message creation fails, a `NOT_FOUND` error is returned instead.
  requestId: string, Optional. A unique request ID for this message. Specifying an existing request ID returns the message created with that ID instead of creating a new message.
  threadKey: string, Optional. Deprecated: Use thread.thread_key instead. ID for the thread. Supports up to 4000 characters. To start or add to a thread, create a message and specify a `threadKey` or the thread.name. For example usage, see [Start or reply to a message thread](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#create-message-thread).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Not supported for messages that contain dialogs. For details, see [Add interactive widgets at the bottom of a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#add-accessory-widgets).

For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a button](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-dialog#add_a_button). To make an image a clickable button, specify an `Image` (not an `ImageComponent`) and set an `onClick` action.

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background likely results in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green, and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that you can express in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255), or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat`. If the icon is set in a `Button`, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

The height of each column is determined by the taller column. For example, if the first column is taller than the second column, both columns have the height of the first column. Because each column can contain a different number of widgets, you can&#x27;t define rows or align widgets between the columns. Columns are displayed side-by-side. You can customize the width of each column using the `HorizontalSizeStyle` field. If the user&#x27;s screen width is too narrow, the second column wraps below the first: * On web, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 480 pixels. * On iOS devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 300 pt. * On Android devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 320 dp.

Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # The colors to use when the type is `BORDER_TYPE_STROKE`.
                              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space.

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background likely results in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green, and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that you can express in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255), or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

The height of each column is determined by the taller column. For example, if the first column is taller than the second column, both columns have the height of the first column. Because each column can contain a different number of widgets, you can&#x27;t define rows or align widgets between the columns. Columns are displayed side-by-side. You can customize the width of each column using the `HorizontalSizeStyle` field. If the user&#x27;s screen width is too narrow, the second column wraps below the first: * On web, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 480 pixels. * On iOS devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 300 pt. * On Android devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 320 dp.

Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # The colors to use when the type is `BORDER_TYPE_STROKE`.
                              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, showDeleted=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists messages in a space that the caller is a member of, including messages from blocked members and spaces. For an example, see [List messages](/chat/api/guides/v1/messages/list). Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user).

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the space to list messages from. Format: `spaces/{space}` (required)
  filter: string, A query filter. You can filter messages by date (`create_time`) and thread (`thread.name`). To filter messages by the date they were created, specify the `create_time` with a timestamp in [RFC-3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format and double quotation marks. For example, `&quot;2023-04-21T11:30:00-04:00&quot;`. You can use the greater than operator `&gt;` to list messages that were created after a timestamp, or the less than operator `&lt;` to list messages that were created before a timestamp. To filter messages within a time interval, use the `AND` operator between two timestamps. To filter by thread, specify the `thread.name`, formatted as `spaces/{space}/threads/{thread}`. You can only specify one `thread.name` per query. To filter by both thread and date, use the `AND` operator in your query. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` create_time &gt; &quot;2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00&quot; create_time &gt; &quot;2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00&quot; AND thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 create_time &gt; &quot;2012-04-21T11:30:00+00:00&quot; AND create_time &lt; &quot;2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00&quot; AND thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  orderBy: string, Optional, if resuming from a previous query. How the list of messages is ordered. Specify a value to order by an ordering operation. Valid ordering operation values are as follows: - `ASC` for ascending. - `DESC` for descending. The default ordering is `create_time ASC`.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of messages returned. The service might return fewer messages than this value. If unspecified, at most 25 are returned. The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value more than 1000, it&#x27;s automatically changed to 1000. Negative values return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
  pageToken: string, Optional, if resuming from a previous query. A page token received from a previous list messages call. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other parameters might lead to unexpected results.
  showDeleted: boolean, Whether to include deleted messages. Deleted messages include deleted time and metadata about their deletion, but message content is unavailable.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for listing messages.
  &quot;messages&quot;: [ # List of messages.
    { # A message in a Google Chat space.
      &quot;accessoryWidgets&quot;: [ # One or more interactive widgets that appear at the bottom of a message. You can add accessory widgets to messages that contain text, cards, or both text and cards. Not supported for messages that contain dialogs. For details, see [Add interactive widgets at the bottom of a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#add-accessory-widgets). Creating a message with accessory widgets requires [app authentication] (https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app).

          &quot;buttonList&quot;: { # A list of buttons layed out horizontally. For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a button](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-dialog#add_a_button). [Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend): # A list of buttons.
            &quot;buttons&quot;: [ # An array of buttons.
              { # A text, icon, or text and icon button that users can click. For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a button](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-dialog#add_a_button). To make an image a clickable button, specify an `Image` (not an `ImageComponent`) and set an `onClick` action. [Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend):
                &quot;altText&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The alternative text that&#x27;s used for accessibility. Set descriptive text that lets users know what the button does. For example, if a button opens a hyperlink, you might write: &quot;Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat&quot;.
                &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background likely results in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green, and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that you can express in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255), or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                  &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                  &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                  &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                  &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                },
                &quot;disabled&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, the button is displayed in an inactive state and doesn&#x27;t respond to user actions.
                &quot;icon&quot;: { # An icon displayed in a widget on a card.

As a best practice, you should set a helpful description for what the icon displays, and if applicable, what it does. For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat`. If the icon is set in a `Button`, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.
                  &quot;iconUrl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Display a custom icon hosted at an HTTPS URL. For example: ``` &quot;iconUrl&quot;: &quot;https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/images/quickstart-app-avatar.png&quot; ``` Supported file types include `.png` and `.jpg`.

To prevent the user from making changes while the action is being processed, set [`LoadIndicator`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/reference/rpc/google.apps.card.v1#loadindicator) to `SPINNER`.

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset.

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # The colors to use when the type is `BORDER_TYPE_STROKE`.

That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
        </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, allowMissing=None, body=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates a message. There&#x27;s a difference between the `patch` and `update` methods. The `patch` method uses a `patch` request while the `update` method uses a `put` request. We recommend using the `patch` method. For an example, see [Update a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/update-messages). Requires [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize). Supports [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) and [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user). When using app authentication, requests can only update messages created by the calling Chat app.

Args:
  name: string, Resource name of the message. Format: `spaces/{space}/messages/{message}` Where `{space}` is the ID of the space where the message is posted and `{message}` is a system-assigned ID for the message. For example, `spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/messages/BBBBBBBBBBB.BBBBBBBBBBB`. If you set a custom ID when you create a message, you can use this ID to specify the message in a request by replacing `{message}` with the value from the `clientAssignedMessageId` field. For example, `spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/messages/client-custom-name`. For details, see [Name a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#name_a_created_message). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A message in a Google Chat space.
  &quot;accessoryWidgets&quot;: [ # One or more interactive widgets that appear at the bottom of a message. You can add accessory widgets to messages that contain text, cards, or both text and cards. Not supported for messages that contain dialogs. For details, see [Add interactive widgets at the bottom of a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#add-accessory-widgets). Creating a message with accessory widgets requires [app authentication] (https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app).

For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a button](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-dialog#add_a_button). [Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend): # A list of buttons.
        &quot;buttons&quot;: [ # An array of buttons.
          { # A text, icon, or text and icon button that users can click. For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a button](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-dialog#add_a_button). To make an image a clickable button, specify an `Image` (not an `ImageComponent`) and set an `onClick` action. [Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend):
            &quot;altText&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The alternative text that&#x27;s used for accessibility. Set descriptive text that lets users know what the button does. For example, if a button opens a hyperlink, you might write: &quot;Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat&quot;.
            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background likely results in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green, and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that you can express in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255), or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space.

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background likely results in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green, and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that you can express in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255), or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat`. If the icon is set in a `Button`, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(name, allowMissing=None, body=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates a message. There&#x27;s a difference between the `patch` and `update` methods. The `patch` method uses a `patch` request while the `update` method uses a `put` request. We recommend using the `patch` method. For an example, see [Update a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/update-messages). Requires [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize). Supports [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) and [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user). When using app authentication, requests can only update messages created by the calling Chat app.

Args:
  name: string, Resource name of the message. Format: `spaces/{space}/messages/{message}` Where `{space}` is the ID of the space where the message is posted and `{message}` is a system-assigned ID for the message. For example, `spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/messages/BBBBBBBBBBB.BBBBBBBBBBB`. If you set a custom ID when you create a message, you can use this ID to specify the message in a request by replacing `{message}` with the value from the `clientAssignedMessageId` field. For example, `spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/messages/client-custom-name`. For details, see [Name a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#name_a_created_message). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A message in a Google Chat space.
  &quot;accessoryWidgets&quot;: [ # One or more interactive widgets that appear at the bottom of a message. You can add accessory widgets to messages that contain text, cards, or both text and cards. Not supported for messages that contain dialogs. For details, see [Add interactive widgets at the bottom of a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#add-accessory-widgets). Creating a message with accessory widgets requires [app authentication] (https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app).

For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a button](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-dialog#add_a_button). [Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend): # A list of buttons.
        &quot;buttons&quot;: [ # An array of buttons.
          { # A text, icon, or text and icon button that users can click. For an example in Google Chat apps, see [Add a button](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/design-interactive-card-dialog#add_a_button). To make an image a clickable button, specify an `Image` (not an `ImageComponent`) and set an `onClick` action. [Google Workspace Add-ons and Chat apps](https://developers.google.com/workspace/extend):
            &quot;altText&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The alternative text that&#x27;s used for accessibility. Set descriptive text that lets users know what the button does. For example, if a button opens a hyperlink, you might write: &quot;Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat&quot;.
            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background likely results in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green, and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that you can express in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255), or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat`. If the icon is set in a `Button`, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

The height of each column is determined by the taller column. For example, if the first column is taller than the second column, both columns have the height of the first column. Because each column can contain a different number of widgets, you can&#x27;t define rows or align widgets between the columns. Columns are displayed side-by-side. You can customize the width of each column using the `HorizontalSizeStyle` field. If the user&#x27;s screen width is too narrow, the second column wraps below the first: * On web, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 480 pixels. * On iOS devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 300 pt. * On Android devices, the second column wraps if the screen width is less than or equal to 320 dp.

Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # The colors to use when the type is `BORDER_TYPE_STROKE`.
                              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space.

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background likely results in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green, and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that you can express in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255), or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set `alpha`, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For `alpha`, a value of `1` corresponds with a solid color, and a value of `0` corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat`. If the icon is set in a `Button`, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

This reference page doesn&#x27;t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB valueâ€”for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space.

For example usage, see [Start or reply to a message thread](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#create-message-thread). If you specify a thread when creating a message, you can set the [`messageReplyOption`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.messages/create#messagereplyoption) field to determine what happens if no matching thread is found. # The thread the message belongs to.

  },
  &quot;threadReply&quot;: True or False, # Output only. When `true`, the message is a response in a reply thread.
