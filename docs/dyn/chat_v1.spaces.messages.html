    &quot;dialogAction&quot;: { # Contains a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs) and request status code. # Input only. A response to an event related to a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). Must be accompanied by `ResponseType.Dialog`.
      &quot;actionStatus&quot;: { # Represents the status for a request to either invoke or submit a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). # Input only. Status for a request to either invoke or submit a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). Displays a status and message to users, if necessary. For example, in case of an error or success.
        &quot;statusCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The status code.
        &quot;userFacingMessage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The message to send users about the status of their request. If unset, a generic message based on the `status_code` is sent.

        &quot;body&quot;: { # Cards support a defined layout, interactive UI elements like buttons, and rich media like images. Use cards to present detailed information, gather information from users, and guide users to take a next step. In Google Chat, cards appear in several places: - As stand-alone messages. - Accompanying a text message, just beneath the text message. - As a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). The following example JSON creates a &quot;contact card&quot; that features: - A header with the contact&#x27;s name, job title, avatar picture. - A section with the contact information, including formatted text. - Buttons that users can click to share the contact or see more or less info. ![Example contact card](https://developers.google.com/chat/images/card_api_reference.png) ``` { &quot;cardsV2&quot;: [ { &quot;cardId&quot;: &quot;unique-card-id&quot;, &quot;card&quot;: { &quot;header&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Sasha&quot;, &quot;subtitle&quot;: &quot;Software Engineer&quot;, &quot;imageUrl&quot;: &quot;https://developers.google.com/chat/images/quickstart-app-avatar.png&quot;, &quot;imageType&quot;: &quot;CIRCLE&quot;, &quot;imageAltText&quot;: &quot;Avatar for Sasha&quot;, }, &quot;sections&quot;: [ { &quot;header&quot;: &quot;Contact Info&quot;, &quot;collapsible&quot;: true, &quot;uncollapsibleWidgetsCount&quot;: 1, &quot;widgets&quot;: [ { &quot;decoratedText&quot;: { &quot;startIcon&quot;: { &quot;knownIcon&quot;: &quot;EMAIL&quot;, }, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;sasha@example.com&quot;, } }, { &quot;decoratedText&quot;: { &quot;startIcon&quot;: { &quot;knownIcon&quot;: &quot;PERSON&quot;, }, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Online&quot;, }, }, { &quot;decoratedText&quot;: { &quot;startIcon&quot;: { &quot;knownIcon&quot;: &quot;PHONE&quot;, }, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;+1 (555) 555-1234&quot;, } }, { &quot;buttonList&quot;: { &quot;buttons&quot;: [ { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Share&quot;, &quot;onClick&quot;: { &quot;openLink&quot;: { &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/share&quot;, } } }, { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Edit&quot;, &quot;onClick&quot;: { &quot;action&quot;: { &quot;function&quot;: &quot;goToView&quot;, &quot;parameters&quot;: [ { &quot;key&quot;: &quot;viewType&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;EDIT&quot;, } ], } } }, ], } }, ], }, ], }, } ], } ``` # Input only.

              &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```

                        &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                          &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                          &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                          &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                      &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # The colors to use when the type is `BORDER_TYPE_STROKE`.
                              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                    &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                      &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                      &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                        &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                          &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                          &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                          &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                      &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

If the icon is set in a Button, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5.

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/chat`.

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5.

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                      &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                      &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale.

For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```

                      &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, an Apps Script can be invoked to handle the form. # What to do when a change occurs in the text input field. Examples of changes include a user adding to the field, or deleting text. Examples of actions to take include running a custom function or opening a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs) in Google Chat.
                      &quot;function&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A custom function to invoke when the containing element is clicked or othrwise activated. For example usage, see [Create interactive cards](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/cards-onclick).

What to do in response to an interaction with a user, such as a user clicking button on a card message. If unspecified, the app responds by executing an `action` - like opening a link or running a function - as normal. By specifying an `interaction`, the app can respond in special interactive ways. For example, by setting `interaction` to `OPEN_DIALOG`, the app can open a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). When specified, a loading indicator is not shown. Supported by Chat apps, but not Google Workspace Add-ons. If specified for an add-on, the entire card is stripped and nothing is shown in the client.

When using [LoadIndicator.NONE](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/reference/rpc/google.apps.card.v1#loadindicator) for actions, `persist_values` = `true`is recommended, as it ensures that any changes made by the user after form or on change actions are sent to the server are not overwritten by the response. If `false`, the form values are cleared when the action is triggered. When `persist_values` is set to `false`, it is strongly recommended that the card use [LoadIndicator.SPINNER](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/reference/rpc/google.apps.card.v1#loadindicator) for all actions, as this locks the UI to ensure no changes are made by the user while the action is being processed.

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
              &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                      &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/chat`. If the icon is set in a Button, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

                    &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                      &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                      &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                      &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

What to do in response to an interaction with a user, such as a user clicking button on a card message. If unspecified, the app responds by executing an `action` - like opening a link or running a function - as normal. By specifying an `interaction`, the app can respond in special interactive ways. For example, by setting `interaction` to `OPEN_DIALOG`, the app can open a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). When specified, a loading indicator is not shown.

When using [LoadIndicator.NONE](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/reference/rpc/google.apps.card.v1#loadindicator) for actions, `persist_values` = `true`is recommended, as it ensures that any changes made by the user after form or on change actions are sent to the server are not overwritten by the response. If `false`, the form values are cleared when the action is triggered. When `persist_values` is set to `false`, it is strongly recommended that the card use [LoadIndicator.SPINNER](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/reference/rpc/google.apps.card.v1#loadindicator) for all actions, as this locks the UI to ensure no changes are made by the user while the action is being processed.

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color.

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                      &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/chat`. If the icon is set in a Button, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

                    &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                      &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                      &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                      &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, by setting `interaction` to `OPEN_DIALOG`, the app can open a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). When specified, a loading indicator is not shown. Supported by Chat apps, but not Google Workspace Add-ons. If specified for an add-on, the entire card is stripped and nothing is shown in the client.

              &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ...

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```

That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```

That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale.

For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```

                      &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/chat`. If the icon is set in a Button, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

                    &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                      &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                      &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # The colors to use when the type is `BORDER_TYPE_STROKE`.
                            &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

              &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                          &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                          &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space.

For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

            &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
              &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
              &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                      &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                    &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                      &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                      &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                      &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/chat`. If the icon is set in a Button, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

              &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

              &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                        &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                          &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                          &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                          &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, if a button opens a hyperlink, you might write: &quot;Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/chat&quot;.
                      &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;green&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of green in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].
                        &quot;red&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of red in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```

That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).

                      &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                        &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                        &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

                    &quot;color&quot;: { # Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor&#x27;s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&amp;red green:&amp;green blue:&amp;blue alpha:&amp;alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha &lt;= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(&#x27;alpha&#x27; in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(&#x27;,&#x27;); return [&#x27;rgba(&#x27;, rgbParams, &#x27;,&#x27;, alphaFrac, &#x27;)&#x27;].join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red &lt;&lt; 16) | (green &lt;&lt; 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [&#x27;#&#x27;]; for (var i = 0; i &lt; missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(&#x27;0&#x27;); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(&#x27;&#x27;); }; // ... # If set, the button is filled with a solid background color and the font color changes to maintain contrast with the background color. For example, setting a blue background will likely result in white text. If unset, the image background is white and the font color is blue. For red, green and blue, the value of each field is a `float` number that can be expressed in either of two ways: as a number between 0 and 255 divided by 255 (153/255) or as a value between 0 and 1 (0.6). 0 represents the absence of a color and 1 or 255/255 represent the full presence of that color on the RGB scale. Optionally set alpha, which sets a level of transparency using this equation: ``` pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color) ``` For alpha, a value of 1 corresponds with a solid color, and a value of 0 corresponds with a completely transparent color. For example, the following color represents a half transparent red: ``` &quot;color&quot;: { &quot;red&quot;: 1, &quot;green&quot;: 0, &quot;blue&quot;: 0, &quot;alpha&quot;: 0.5 } ```
                      &quot;alpha&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color = alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of 1.0).
                      &quot;blue&quot;: 3.14, # The amount of blue in the color as a value in the interval [0, 1].

For example, `A user&#x27;s account portrait`, or `Opens a new browser tab and navigates to the Google Chat developer documentation at https://developers.google.com/chat`. If the icon is set in a Button, the `altText` appears as helper text when the user hovers over the button. However, if the button also sets `text`, the icon&#x27;s `altText` is ignored.

This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.).

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness.

This reference page doesn&#x27;t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space.
