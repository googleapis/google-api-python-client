    { # Describes the settings associated with a project, folder, organization, or billing account.
  &quot;defaultSinkConfig&quot;: { # Describes the custom _Default sink configuration that is used to override the built-in _Default sink configuration in newly created resource containers, such as projects or folders. # Optional. Overrides the built-in configuration for _Default sink.
    &quot;exclusions&quot;: [ # Optional. Specifies the set of exclusions to be added to the _Default sink in newly created resource containers.
      { # Specifies a set of log entries that are filtered out by a sink. If your Google Cloud resource receives a large volume of log entries, you can use exclusions to reduce your chargeable logs. Note that exclusions on organization-level and folder-level sinks don&#x27;t apply to child resources. Note also that you cannot modify the _Required sink or exclude logs from it.
        &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The creation timestamp of the exclusion.This field may not be present for older exclusions.
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A description of this exclusion.
        &quot;disabled&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If set to True, then this exclusion is disabled and it does not exclude any log entries. You can update an exclusion to change the value of this field.
        &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries) that matches the log entries to be excluded. By using the sample function (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries#sample), you can exclude less than 100% of the matching log entries.For example, the following query matches 99% of low-severity log entries from Google Cloud Storage buckets:resource.type=gcs_bucket severity&lt;ERROR sample(insertId, 0.99)
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A client-assigned identifier, such as &quot;load-balancer-exclusion&quot;. Identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods. First character has to be alphanumeric.
        &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last update timestamp of the exclusion.This field may not be present for older exclusions.
      },
    ],
    &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An advanced logs filter (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries). The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter.For example:logName=&quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]&quot; AND severity&gt;=ERRORCannot be empty or unset if mode == OVERWRITE. In order to match all logs, use the following line as the value of filter and do not use exclusions:logName:*
    &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Determines the behavior to apply to the built-in _Default sink inclusion filter.Exclusions are always appended, as built-in _Default sinks have no exclusions.
  },
  &quot;disableDefaultSink&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If set to true, the _Default sink in newly created projects and folders will created in a disabled state. This can be used to automatically disable log storage if there is already an aggregated sink configured in the hierarchy. The _Default sink can be re-enabled manually if needed.
  &quot;kmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The resource name for the configured Cloud KMS key.KMS key name format: &quot;projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION]/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY]&quot; For example:&quot;projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/keyRings/my-ring/cryptoKeys/my-key&quot;To enable CMEK, set this field to a valid kms_key_name for which the associated service account has the required roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter role assigned for the key.The Cloud KMS key used by the Log Router can be updated by changing the kms_key_name to a new valid key name.To disable CMEK for the Log Router, set this field to an empty string.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.
  &quot;kmsServiceAccountId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The service account that will be used by the Log Router to access your Cloud KMS key.Before enabling CMEK, you must first assign the role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter to the service account that will be used to access your Cloud KMS key. Use GetSettings to obtain the service account ID.See Enabling CMEK for Log Router (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/managed-encryption) for more information.
  &quot;loggingServiceAccountId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The service account for the given resource container, such as project or folder. Log sinks use this service account as their writer_identity if no custom service account is provided in the request when calling the create sink method.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the settings.
  &quot;storageLocation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The storage location that Cloud Logging will use to create new resources when a location is needed but not explicitly provided. The use cases includes: The location of _Default and _Required log bucket for newly created projects and folders.Example value: europe-west1.Note: this setting does not affect the location of resources where a location is explicitly provided when created, such as custom log buckets.
