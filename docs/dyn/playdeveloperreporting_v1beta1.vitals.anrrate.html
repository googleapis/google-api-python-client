This metric set contains ANRs data combined with usage data to produce a normalized metric independent of user counts. **Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are aggregated in calendar date intervals. Due to historical constraints, the only supported timezone is `America/Los_Angeles`. **Supported metrics:** * `anrRate` (`google.type.Decimal`): Percentage of distinct users in the aggregation period that experienced at least one ANR. If your app exhibits an ANR rate equal to or higher than the threshold, it&#x27;s in the bottom 25% of the top 1,000 apps on Google Play (by number of installs). * `anrRate7dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `anrRate` in the last 7 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `anrRate28dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `anrRate` in the last 28 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `distinctUsers` (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users in the aggregation period that were used as normalization value for the `anrRate` metric. A user is counted in this metric if they used the app in the foreground during the aggregation period. Care must be taken not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted multiple times. **Supported dimensions:** * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running on the user&#x27;s device. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was running on the user&#x27;s device. * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of the user&#x27;s device model. * `deviceType` (string): the type (also known as form factor) of the user&#x27;s device. * `countryCode` (string): the country or region of the user&#x27;s device based on their IP address, represented as a 2-letter ISO-3166 code (e.g. US for the United States). * `deviceRamBucket` (int64): RAM of the device, in MB, in buckets (3GB, 4GB, etc.). * `deviceSocMake` (string): Make of the device&#x27;s primary system-on-chip, e.g., Samsung. [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MANUFACTURER) * `deviceSocModel` (string): Model of the device&#x27;s primary system-on-chip, e.g., &quot;Exynos 2100&quot;. [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MODEL) * `deviceCpuMake` (string): Make of the device&#x27;s CPU, e.g., Qualcomm. * `deviceCpuModel` (string): Model of the device&#x27;s CPU, e.g., &quot;Kryo 240&quot;. * `deviceGpuMake` (string): Make of the device&#x27;s GPU, e.g., ARM. * `deviceGpuModel` (string): Model of the device&#x27;s GPU, e.g., Mali. * `deviceGpuVersion` (string): Version of the device&#x27;s GPU, e.g., T750. * `deviceVulkanVersion` (string): Vulkan version of the device, e.g., &quot;4198400&quot;. * `deviceGlEsVersion` (string): OpenGL ES version of the device, e.g., &quot;196610&quot;. * `deviceScreenSize` (string): Screen size of the device, e.g., NORMAL, LARGE. * `deviceScreenDpi` (string): Screen density of the device, e.g., mdpi, hdpi. **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app. **Related metric sets:** * vitals.errors contains unnormalized version (absolute counts) of crashes. * vitals.errors contains normalized metrics about crashes, another stability metric.

The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set. Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also would like to store the user&#x27;s timezone, that can be done in another field.

The time is specified in the metric set&#x27;s default timezone. *Note:* time ranges in TimelineSpec are represented as `start_time, end_time)`. For example, if the latest available timeline data point for a `DAILY` aggregation period is `2021-06-23 00:00:00 America/Los_Angeles`, the value of this field would be `2021-06-24 00:00:00 America/Los_Angeles` so it can be easily reused in [TimelineSpec.end_time.

            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (&quot;the integer&quot;), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -&gt; `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -&gt; `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to lower-case (`2.5E8` -&gt; `2.5e8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5e0` -&gt; `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5e-1` &lt;-&gt; `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = &#x27;+&#x27; | &#x27;-&#x27;; Significand = Digits &#x27;.&#x27; | [Digits] &#x27;.&#x27; Digits; Exponent = (&#x27;e&#x27; | &#x27;E&#x27;) [Sign] Digits; Digits = { &#x27;0&#x27; | &#x27;1&#x27; | &#x27;2&#x27; | &#x27;3&#x27; | &#x27;4&#x27; | &#x27;5&#x27; | &#x27;6&#x27; | &#x27;7&#x27; | &#x27;8&#x27; | &#x27;9&#x27; }; Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range.

      &quot;startTime&quot;: { # Represents civil time (or occasionally physical time). This type can represent a civil time in one of a few possible ways: * When utc_offset is set and time_zone is unset: a civil time on a calendar day with a particular offset from UTC. * When time_zone is set and utc_offset is unset: a civil time on a calendar day in a particular time zone. * When neither time_zone nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar day in local time. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set. Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also would like to store the user&#x27;s timezone, that can be done in another field. This type is more flexible than some applications may want. Make sure to document and validate your application&#x27;s limitations. # Starting date (and time for hourly aggregation) of the period covered by this row.
