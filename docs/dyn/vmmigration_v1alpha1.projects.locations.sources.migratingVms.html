  migratingVmId: string, Required. The migratingVm identifier.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists MigratingVms in a given Source.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent, which owns this collection of MigratingVms. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. The filter request.
  orderBy: string, Optional. the order by fields for the result.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of migrating VMs to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 500 migrating VMs will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.
  pageToken: string, Required. A page token, received from a previous `ListMigratingVms` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListMigratingVms` must match the call that provided the page token.
  view: string, Optional. The level of details of each migrating VM.
    Allowed values
      MIGRATING_VM_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - View is unspecified. The API will fallback to the default value.
      MIGRATING_VM_VIEW_BASIC - Get the migrating VM basic details. The basic details do not include the recent clone jobs and recent cutover jobs lists.

  requestId: string, A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the MigratingVm resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask.
