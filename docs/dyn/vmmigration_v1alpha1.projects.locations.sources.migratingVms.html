  migratingVmId: string, Required. The migratingVm identifier.
  requestId: string, A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent, which owns this collection of MigratingVms. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. The filter request.
  orderBy: string, Optional. the order by fields for the result.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of migrating VMs to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 500 migrating VMs will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000.
  pageToken: string, Required. A page token, received from a previous `ListMigratingVms` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListMigratingVms` must match the call that provided the page token.
  view: string, Optional. The level of details of each migrating VM.
    Allowed values
      MIGRATING_VM_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - View is unspecified. The API will fallback to the default value.
      MIGRATING_VM_VIEW_BASIC - Get the migrating VM basic details. The basic details do not include the recent clone jobs and recent cutover jobs lists.
      MIGRATING_VM_VIEW_FULL - Include everything.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  requestId: string, A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="startMigration">startMigration(migratingVm, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts migration for a VM. Starts the process of uploading data and creating snapshots, in replication cycles scheduled by the policy.

Args:
  migratingVm: string, Required. The name of the MigratingVm. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for &#x27;StartMigrationRequest&#x27; request.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
