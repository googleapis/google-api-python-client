<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="instorerefundlineitem">instorerefundlineitem(merchantId, orderId, body)</code>
  <pre>Notifies that item return and refund was handled directly by merchant outside of Google payments processing (e.g. cash refund done in store).
Note: We recommend calling the returnrefundlineitem method to refund in-store returns. We will issue the refund directly to the customer. This helps to prevent possible differences arising between merchant and Google transaction records. We also recommend having the point of sale system communicate with Google to ensure that customers do not receive a double refund by first refunding via Google then via an in-store return.

Args:
  merchantId: string, The ID of the account that manages the order. This cannot be a multi-client account. (required)
  orderId: string, The ID of the order. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "operationId": "A String", # The ID of the operation. Unique across all operations for a given order.
    "reason": "A String", # The reason for the return.
    "amountPretax": { # The amount that is refunded. Required.
      "currency": "A String", # The currency of the price.
      "value": "A String", # The price represented as a number.
    },
    "reasonText": "A String", # The explanation of the reason.
    "lineItemId": "A String", # The ID of the line item to return. Either lineItemId or productId is required.
    "amountTax": { # Tax amount that correspond to refund amount in amountPretax. Required.
      "currency": "A String", # The currency of the price.
      "value": "A String", # The price represented as a number.

    "productId": "A String", # The ID of the product to return. This is the REST ID used in the products service. Either lineItemId or productId is required.
    "quantity": 42, # The quantity to return and refund.
  }


Returns:
