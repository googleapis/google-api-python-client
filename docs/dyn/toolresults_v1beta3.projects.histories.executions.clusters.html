<p class="firstline">Lists Screenshot Clusters Returns the list of screenshot clusters corresponding to an execution. Screenshot clusters are created after the execution is finished. Clusters are created from a set of screenshots. Between any two screenshots, a matching score is calculated based off their metadata that determines how similar they are. Screenshots are placed in the cluster that has screens which have the highest matching scores.</p>
