Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource where this worker pool will be created. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Configuration for a `WorkerPool`. Cloud Build owns and maintains a pool of workers for general use and have no access to a project&#x27;s private network. By default, builds submitted to Cloud Build will use a worker from this pool. If your build needs access to resources on a private network, create and use a `WorkerPool` to run your builds. Private `WorkerPool`s give your builds access to any single VPC network that you administer, including any on-prem resources connected to that VPC network. For an overview of private pools, see [Private pools overview](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/private-pools-overview).

See [Worker pool config file](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/worker-pool-config-file-schema). Specify a value of up to 2000. If `0` is specified, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.
      &quot;machineType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Machine type of a worker, such as `e2-medium`. See [Worker pool config file](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/worker-pool-config-file-schema). If left blank, Cloud Build will use a sensible default.

The value of `{worker_pool}` is provided by `worker_pool_id` in `CreateWorkerPool` request and the value of `{location}` is determined by the endpoint accessed.
  &quot;privatePoolV1Config&quot;: { # Configuration for a V1 `PrivatePool`. # Legacy Private Pool configuration.
    &quot;networkConfig&quot;: { # Defines the network configuration for the pool. # Network configuration for the pool.
      &quot;egressOption&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Option to configure network egress for the workers.
      &quot;peeredNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The network definition that the workers are peered to. If this section is left empty, the workers will be peered to `WorkerPool.project_id` on the service producer network. Must be in the format `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`, where `{project}` is a project number, such as `12345`, and `{network}` is the name of a VPC network in the project. See [Understanding network configuration options](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/set-up-private-pool-environment)
      &quot;peeredNetworkIpRange&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Subnet IP range within the peered network. This is specified in CIDR notation with a slash and the subnet prefix size. You can optionally specify an IP address before the subnet prefix value. e.g. `192.168.0.0/29` would specify an IP range starting at 192.168.0.0 with a prefix size of 29 bits. `/16` would specify a prefix size of 16 bits, with an automatically determined IP within the peered VPC. If unspecified, a value of `/24` will be used.
    },
    &quot;workerConfig&quot;: { # Defines the configuration to be used for creating workers in the pool. # Machine configuration for the workers in the pool.
      &quot;diskSizeGb&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Size of the disk attached to the worker, in GB. See [Worker pool config file](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/worker-pool-config-file-schema). Specify a value of up to 2000. If `0` is specified, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.
      &quot;machineType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Machine type of a worker, such as `e2-medium`. See [Worker pool config file](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/worker-pool-config-file-schema). If left blank, Cloud Build will use a sensible default.
    },
  },
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. `WorkerPool` state.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A unique identifier for the `WorkerPool`.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time at which the request to update the `WorkerPool` was received.
}

  updateMask: string, A mask specifying which fields in `worker_pool` to update.
  validateOnly: boolean, If set, validate the request and preview the response, but do not actually post it.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
