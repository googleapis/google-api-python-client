  <pre>Converses a conversation.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the Conversation to get. Format: `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/collections/{collection}/dataStores/{data_store_id}/conversations/{conversation_id}`. Use `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location_id}/collections/{collection}/dataStores/{data_store_id}/conversations/-` to activate auto session mode, which automatically creates a new conversation inside a ConverseConversation session. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for ConversationalSearchService.ConverseConversation method.
  &quot;boostSpec&quot;: { # Boost specification to boost certain documents. # Boost specification to boost certain documents in search results which may affect the converse response. For more information on boosting, see [Boosting](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/boosting#boost)
    &quot;conditionBoostSpecs&quot;: [ # Condition boost specifications. If a document matches multiple conditions in the specifictions, boost scores from these specifications are all applied and combined in a non-linear way. Maximum number of specifications is 20.
      { # Boost applies to documents which match a condition.
        &quot;boost&quot;: 3.14, # Strength of the condition boost, which should be in [-1, 1]. Negative boost means demotion. Default is 0.0. Setting to 1.0 gives the document a big promotion. However, it does not necessarily mean that the boosted document will be the top result at all times, nor that other documents will be excluded. Results could still be shown even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your heavily favored but irrelevant documents. Setting to -1.0 gives the document a big demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant might still be shown. The document will have an upstream battle to get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely. Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored. Only one of the (condition, boost) combination or the boost_control_spec below are set. If both are set then the global boost is ignored and the more fine-grained boost_control_spec is applied.

          &quot;controlPoints&quot;: [ # The control points used to define the curve. The monotonic function (defined through the interpolation_type above) passes through the control points listed here.

              &quot;attributeValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Can be one of: 1. The numerical field value. 2. The duration spec for freshness: The value must be formatted as an XSD `dayTimeDuration` value (a restricted subset of an ISO 8601 duration value). The pattern for this is: `nDnM]`.
              &quot;boostAmount&quot;: 3.14, # The value between -1 to 1 by which to boost the score if the attribute_value evaluates to the value specified above.

Google employs search-query classification to detect adversarial queries. No summary is returned if the search query is classified as an adversarial query. For example, a user might ask a question regarding negative comments about the company or submit a query designed to generate unsafe, policy-violating output. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating summaries for adversarial queries and return fallback messages instead.
    &quot;ignoreNonSummarySeekingQuery&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to filter out queries that are not summary-seeking. The default value is `false`. Google employs search-query classification to detect summary-seeking queries. No summary is returned if the search query is classified as a non-summary seeking query. For example, `why is the sky blue` and `Who is the best soccer player in the world?` are summary-seeking queries, but `SFO airport` and `world cup 2026` are not. They are most likely navigational queries. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating summaries for non-summary seeking queries and return fallback messages instead.
    &quot;includeCitations&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to include citations in the summary. The default value is `false`. When this field is set to `true`, summaries include in-line citation numbers. Example summary including citations: BigQuery is Google Cloud&#x27;s fully managed and completely serverless enterprise data warehouse [1]. BigQuery supports all data types, works across clouds, and has built-in machine learning and business intelligence, all within a unified platform [2, 3]. The citation numbers refer to the returned search results and are 1-indexed. For example, [1] means that the sentence is attributed to the first search result. [2, 3] means that the sentence is attributed to both the second and third search results.
    &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Language code for Summary. Use language tags defined by [BCP47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt). Note: This is an experimental feature.
