<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, name=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new environment group.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the organization in which to create the environment group in the following format: `organizations/{org}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # EnvironmentGroup configuration. An environment group is used to group one or more Apigee environments under a single host name.
  &quot;createdAt&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the environment group was created as milliseconds since epoch.
  &quot;hostnames&quot;: [ # Required. Host names for this environment group.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;lastModifiedAt&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the environment group was last updated as milliseconds since epoch.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # ID of the environment group.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. State of the environment group. Values other than ACTIVE means the resource is not ready to use.
}

  name: string, ID of the environment group. Overrides any ID in the environment_group resource.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
