  <pre>Incremental update: Adds an acl entry to an acl. Creates the acl if it does not exist yet.

Args:
  acl: string, Required. The name of the acl to add the acl entry to. Structured like: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/clusters/{cluster}/acls/{acl_id}`. The structure of `acl_id` defines the Resource Pattern (resource_type, resource_name, pattern_type) of the acl. See `Acl.name` for details. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents the access granted for a given Resource Pattern in an ACL.
  &quot;host&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The host. Must be set to &quot;*&quot; for Managed Service for Apache Kafka.
  &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The operation type. Allowed values are (case insensitive): ALL, READ, WRITE, CREATE, DELETE, ALTER, DESCRIBE, CLUSTER_ACTION, DESCRIBE_CONFIGS, ALTER_CONFIGS, and IDEMPOTENT_WRITE. See https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#operations_resources_and_protocols for valid combinations of resource_type and operation for different Kafka API requests.
  &quot;permissionType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The permission type. Accepted values are (case insensitive): ALLOW, DENY.
  &quot;principal&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The principal. Specified as Google Cloud account, with the Kafka StandardAuthorizer prefix &quot;User:&quot;. For example: &quot;User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com&quot;. Can be the wildcard &quot;User:*&quot; to refer to all users.

A terminal &#x27;T&#x27; character in the etag indicates that the AclEntries were truncated; more entries for the Acl exist on the Kafka Cluster, but can&#x27;t be returned in the Acl due to repeated field limits.

  <pre>Updates the properties of a single acl.

Args:
  name: string, Identifier. The name for the acl. Represents a single Resource Pattern. Structured like: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/clusters/{cluster}/acls/{acl_id} The structure of `acl_id` defines the Resource Pattern (resource_type, resource_name, pattern_type) of the acl. `acl_id` is structured like one of the following: For acls on the cluster: `cluster` For acls on a single resource within the cluster: `topic/{resource_name}` `consumerGroup/{resource_name}` `transactionalId/{resource_name}` For acls on all resources that match a prefix: `topicPrefixed/{resource_name}` `consumerGroupPrefixed/{resource_name}` `transactionalIdPrefixed/{resource_name}` For acls on all resources of a given type (i.e. the wildcard literal &quot;*&quot;): `allTopics` (represents `topic/*`) `allConsumerGroups` (represents `consumerGroup/*`) `allTransactionalIds` (represents `transactionalId/*`) (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents the set of ACLs for a given Kafka Resource Pattern, which consists of resource_type, resource_name and pattern_type.
  &quot;aclEntries&quot;: [ # Required. The ACL entries that apply to the resource pattern. The maximum number of allowed entries 100.
    { # Represents the access granted for a given Resource Pattern in an ACL.
      &quot;host&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The host. Must be set to &quot;*&quot; for Managed Service for Apache Kafka.
      &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The operation type. Allowed values are (case insensitive): ALL, READ, WRITE, CREATE, DELETE, ALTER, DESCRIBE, CLUSTER_ACTION, DESCRIBE_CONFIGS, ALTER_CONFIGS, and IDEMPOTENT_WRITE. See https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#operations_resources_and_protocols for valid combinations of resource_type and operation for different Kafka API requests.
      &quot;permissionType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The permission type. Accepted values are (case insensitive): ALLOW, DENY.
      &quot;principal&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The principal. Specified as Google Cloud account, with the Kafka StandardAuthorizer prefix &quot;User:&quot;. For example: &quot;User:test-kafka-client@test-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com&quot;. Can be the wildcard &quot;User:*&quot; to refer to all users.
    },
  ],
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. `etag` is used for concurrency control. An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetAcl` and `CreateAcl`. Callers are required to put that etag in the request to `UpdateAcl` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the acl that exists in the Kafka Cluster. A terminal &#x27;T&#x27; character in the etag indicates that the AclEntries were truncated; more entries for the Acl exist on the Kafka Cluster, but can&#x27;t be returned in the Acl due to repeated field limits.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The name for the acl. Represents a single Resource Pattern. Structured like: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/clusters/{cluster}/acls/{acl_id} The structure of `acl_id` defines the Resource Pattern (resource_type, resource_name, pattern_type) of the acl. `acl_id` is structured like one of the following: For acls on the cluster: `cluster` For acls on a single resource within the cluster: `topic/{resource_name}` `consumerGroup/{resource_name}` `transactionalId/{resource_name}` For acls on all resources that match a prefix: `topicPrefixed/{resource_name}` `consumerGroupPrefixed/{resource_name}` `transactionalIdPrefixed/{resource_name}` For acls on all resources of a given type (i.e. the wildcard literal &quot;*&quot;): `allTopics` (represents `topic/*`) `allConsumerGroups` (represents `consumerGroup/*`) `allTransactionalIds` (represents `transactionalId/*`)
  &quot;patternType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The ACL pattern type derived from the name. One of: LITERAL, PREFIXED.
  &quot;resourceName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The ACL resource name derived from the name. For cluster resource_type, this is always &quot;kafka-cluster&quot;. Can be the wildcard literal &quot;*&quot;.
  &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The ACL resource type derived from the name. One of: CLUSTER, TOPIC, GROUP, TRANSACTIONAL_ID.
}

  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Acl resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
