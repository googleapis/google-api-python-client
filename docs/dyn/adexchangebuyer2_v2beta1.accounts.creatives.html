  duplicateIdMode: string, Indicates if multiple creatives can share an ID or not. Default is NO_DUPLICATES (one ID per creative).
    Allowed values
      NO_DUPLICATES - Recommended. This means that an ID will be unique to a single creative. Multiple creatives will not share an ID.
      FORCE_ENABLE_DUPLICATE_IDS - Not recommended. Using this option will allow multiple creatives to share the same ID. Get and Update requests will not be possible for any ID that has more than one creative associated. (List will still function.) This is only intended for backwards compatibility in cases where a single ID is already shared by multiple creatives from previous APIs.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
