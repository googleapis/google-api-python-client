<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="watch">watch(accountId, creativeId, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Watches a creative. Will result in push notifications being sent to the
topic when the creative changes status.

Args:
  accountId: string, The account of the creative to watch. (required)
  creativeId: string, The creative ID to watch for status changes.
Specify "-" to watch all creatives under the above account.
If both creative-level and account-level notifications are
sent, only a single notification will be sent to the
creative-level notification topic. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request for watching changes to creative Status.
    "topic": "A String", # The Pub/Sub topic to publish notifications to.
        # This topic must already exist and must give permission to
        # ad-exchange-buyside-reports@google.com to write to the topic.
        # This should be the full resource name in
        # "projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_id}" format.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
