Args:

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Service-Level Objective (SLO) describes a level of desired good service. It consists of a service-level indicator (SLI), a performance goal, and a period over which the objective is to be evaluated against that goal. The SLO can use SLIs defined in a number of different manners. Typical SLOs might include &quot;99% of requests in each rolling week have latency below 200 milliseconds&quot; or &quot;99.5% of requests in each calendar month return successfully.&quot;
  &quot;calendarPeriod&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A calendar period, semantically &quot;since the start of the current &quot;. At this time, only DAY, WEEK, FORTNIGHT, and MONTH are supported.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name used for UI elements listing this SLO.
  &quot;goal&quot;: 3.14, # The fraction of service that must be good in order for this objective to be met. 0 &lt; goal &lt;= 0.999.

Alternatively, a &quot;custom&quot; SLI can be defined with a query to the underlying metric store. An SLI is defined to be good_service / total_service over any queried time interval. The value of performance always falls into the range 0 &lt;= performance &lt;= 1. A custom SLI describes how to compute this ratio, whether this is by dividing values from a pair of time series, cutting a Distribution into good and bad counts, or counting time windows in which the service complies with a criterion. For separation of concerns, a single Service-Level Indicator measures performance for only one aspect of service quality, such as fraction of successful queries or fast-enough queries. # The definition of good service, used to measure and calculate the quality of the Service&#x27;s performance with respect to a single aspect of service quality.

The value of performance always falls into the range 0 &lt;= performance &lt;= 1. A custom SLI describes how to compute this ratio, whether this is by dividing values from a pair of time series, cutting a Distribution into good and bad counts, or counting time windows in which the service complies with a criterion.
