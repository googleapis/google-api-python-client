    "primaryGeometry": "A String", # The name of the column that contains a feature's geometry. This field can be omitted during table create; Google Maps Engine supports only a single geometry column, which must be named geometry and be the first object in the columns array.
    "primaryKey": "A String", # The name of the column that contains the unique identifier of a Feature.
    "columns": [ # An array of TableColumn objects. The first object in the array must be named geometry and be of type points, lineStrings, polygons, or mixedGeometry.
