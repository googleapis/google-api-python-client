If you don&#x27;t specify this field but do specify the command field, then the command from the `command` field runs without any additional arguments. See the [Kubernetes documentation about how the `command` and `args` fields interact with a container&#x27;s `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#notes). If you don&#x27;t specify this field and don&#x27;t specify the `command` field, then the container&#x27;s [`ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) and `CMD` determine what runs based on their default behavior.

You cannot reference environment variables set in the Docker image. In order for environment variables to be expanded, reference them by using the following syntax: $( VARIABLE_NAME) Note that this differs from Bash variable expansion, which does not use parentheses.

To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax with `$$`; for example: $$(VARIABLE_NAME) This field corresponds to the `args` field of the Kubernetes Containers [v1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#container-v1-core).

Read more about [health checks](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#health). For example, if you set this field to `/bar`, then Vertex AI intermittently sends a GET request to the `/bar` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`&#x27;s ports field.
