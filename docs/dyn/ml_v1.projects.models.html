  <pre>Creates a model which will later contain one or more versions.

You must add at least one version before you can request predictions from
the model. Add versions by calling
projects.models.versions.create.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a machine learning solution.

    # A model can have multiple versions, each of which is a deployed, trained
    # model ready to receive prediction requests. The model itself is just a
    # container.
  &quot;defaultVersion&quot;: { # Represents a version of the model. # Output only. The default version of the model. This version will be used to
      # handle prediction requests that do not specify a version.
      # 
      # You can change the default version by calling
      # projects.models.versions.setDefault.
      #
      # Each version is a trained model deployed in the cloud, ready to handle
      # prediction requests. A model can have multiple versions. You can get
      # information about all of the versions of a given model by calling
      # projects.models.versions.list.

        # Only specify this field if you have specified a Compute Engine (N1) machine
        # type in the `machineType` field. Learn more about [using GPUs for online
        # prediction](/ml-engine/docs/machine-types-online-prediction#gpus).
        # Note that the AcceleratorConfig can be used in both Jobs and Versions.

        # predictable billing. Beware that latency and error rates will increase

          # last billing cycle plus the cost for each prediction performed.
    },
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of a version.

  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource.
Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy
set.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  options_requestedPolicyVersion: integer, Optional. The policy format version to be returned.

Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
rejected.

Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.
Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
leave the field unset.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the models in a project.

Each project can contain multiple models, and each model can have multiple
versions.

If there are no models that match the request parameters, the list request
returns an empty response body: {}.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project whose models are to be listed. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Specifies the subset of models to retrieve.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token to request the next page of results.

You get the token from the `next_page_token` field of the response from
the previous call.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The number of models to retrieve per &quot;page&quot; of results. If there
are more remaining results than this number, the response message will
contain a valid value in the `next_page_token` field.

The default value is 20, and the maximum page size is 100.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

      # 
      # The model name must be unique within the project it is created in.
}

  updateMask: string, Required. Specifies the path, relative to `Model`, of the field to update.

For example, to change the description of a model to &quot;foo&quot; and set its
default version to &quot;version_1&quot;, the `update_mask` parameter would be
specified as `description`, `default_version.name`, and the `PATCH`
request body would specify the new value, as follows:
    {
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;,
      &quot;defaultVersion&quot;: {
        &quot;name&quot;:&quot;version_1&quot;

Currently the supported update masks are `description` and
`default_version.name`.

        # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more

        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
        # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource

      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
