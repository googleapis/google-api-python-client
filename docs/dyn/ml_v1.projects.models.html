  <pre>Creates a model which will later contain one or more versions.

You must add at least one version before you can request predictions from
the model. Add versions by calling
projects.models.versions.create.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The project name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a machine learning solution.
    # 
    # A model can have multiple versions, each of which is a deployed, trained
    # model ready to receive prediction requests. The model itself is just a
    # container.

      # 
      # The model name must be unique within the project it is created in.
  "onlinePredictionConsoleLogging": True or False, # Optional. If true, online prediction nodes send `stderr` and `stdout`
      # streams to Stackdriver Logging. These can be more verbose than the standard
      # access logs (see `onlinePredictionLogging`) and can incur higher cost.
      # However, they are helpful for debugging. Note that
      # [Stackdriver logs may incur a cost](/stackdriver/pricing), especially if
      # your project receives prediction requests at a high QPS. Estimate your
      # costs before enabling this option.
      # 
      # Default is false.
  "labels": { # Optional. One or more labels that you can add, to organize your models.
      # Each label is a key-value pair, where both the key and the value are

      # *   No matter where a model is deployed, it can always be accessed by
      #     users from anywhere, both for online and batch prediction.
      # *   The region for a batch prediction job is set by the region field when

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the models in a project.

Each project can contain multiple models, and each model can have multiple
versions.

If there are no models that match the request parameters, the list request
returns an empty response body: {}.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project whose models are to be listed. (required)
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The number of models to retrieve per "page" of results. If there
are more remaining results than this number, the response message will
contain a valid value in the `next_page_token` field.

The default value is 20, and the maximum page size is 100.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token to request the next page of results.

You get the token from the `next_page_token` field of the response from
the previous call.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, Optional. Specifies the subset of models to retrieve.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  "onlinePredictionLogging": True or False, # Optional. If true, online prediction access logs are sent to StackDriver
      # Logging. These logs are like standard server access logs, containing

  "description": "A String", # Optional. The description specified for the model when it was created.
}

  updateMask: string, Required. Specifies the path, relative to `Model`, of the field to update.

For example, to change the description of a model to "foo" and set its
default version to "version_1", the `update_mask` parameter would be
specified as `description`, `default_version.name`, and the `PATCH`
request body would specify the new value, as follows:
    {
      "description": "foo",
      "defaultVersion": {
        "name":"version_1"
      }
    }

Currently the supported update masks are `description` and
`default_version.name`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

    The object takes the form of:

        # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
        # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
        # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
        # request, the resource, or both.

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more

  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
