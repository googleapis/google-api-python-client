  pageToken: string, The next_page_token value returned from a previous search request, if any.
  query: string, Query string for performing search on groups.
Users can search on namespace and label attributes of groups.
EXACT match ('=') is supported on namespace, and CONTAINS match (':') is
supported on labels. This is a `required` field.
Multiple queries can be combined using `AND` operator. The operator is case
sensitive.
An example query would be:
"namespace=<namespace_value> AND labels:<labels_value>".
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  view: string, Group resource view to be returned. Defaults to [GroupView.BASIC]().
