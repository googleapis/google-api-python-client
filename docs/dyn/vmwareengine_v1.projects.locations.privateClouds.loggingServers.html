  <pre>Create a new logging server for a given private cloud.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the private cloud to create a new Logging Server in. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Logging server to receive vCenter or ESXi logs.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Creation time of this resource.
  &quot;hostname&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP Address of the logging server.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of this logging server. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud/loggingServers/my-logging-server`
  &quot;port&quot;: 42, # Required. Port number at which the logging server receives logs.
  &quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Protocol used by vCenter to send logs to a logging server.
  &quot;sourceType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The type of component that produces logs that will be forwarded to this logging server.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. System-generated unique identifier for the resource.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Last update time of this resource.
}

  loggingServerId: string, Required. The user-provided identifier of the `LoggingServer` to be created. This identifier must be unique among `LoggingServer` resources within the parent and becomes the final token in the name URI. The identifier must meet the following requirements: * Only contains 1-63 alphanumeric characters and hyphens * Begins with an alphabetical character * Ends with a non-hyphen character * Not formatted as a UUID * Complies with [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) (section 3.5)
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn&#x27;t result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the private cloud to be queried for logging servers.

For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud` (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that matches resources returned in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, or `&lt;`. For example, if you are filtering a list of logging servers, you can exclude the ones named `example-server` by specifying `name != &quot;example-server&quot;`. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = &quot;example-server&quot;) (createTime &gt; &quot;2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (name = &quot;example-server-1&quot;) AND (createTime &gt; &quot;2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z&quot;) OR (name = &quot;example-server-2&quot;) ```
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned results are ordered by `name` in ascending order. You can also sort results in descending order based on the `name` value using `orderBy=&quot;name desc&quot;`. Currently, only ordering by `name` is supported.

If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
