    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Reports in a given ReportConfig.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent value for `ListReportsRequest`. (required)
  filter: string, Filtering results.
  orderBy: string, Field to sort by. See https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering for more details.
  pageSize: integer, Requested page size. The server may return fewer items than requested. If unspecified, the server will pick an appropriate default value.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying a page of results that the server should return.
  view: string, Determines what information to retrieve for each Report.
    Allowed values
      REPORT_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - The report view is not specified. The API displays the basic view by default.
      REPORT_VIEW_BASIC - The report view includes only basic metadata of the Report. Useful for list views.
      REPORT_VIEW_FULL - The report view includes all the metadata of the Report. Useful for preview.
      REPORT_VIEW_STANDARD - The report view includes the standard metadata of an report. Useful for detail view.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
