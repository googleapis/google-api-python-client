    The object takes the form of:

{ # A message representing a health dataset.
    #

    # or more patients. This may include multiple modalities of healthcare data,
    # such as electronic medical records or medical imaging data.
  "timeZone": "A String", # The default timezone used by this dataset. Must be a either a valid IANA
      # time zone name such as "America/New_York" or empty, which defaults to UTC.

      # explicit timezone is specified.
  "name": "A String", # Output only. Resource name of the dataset, of the form
      # `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more

  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
