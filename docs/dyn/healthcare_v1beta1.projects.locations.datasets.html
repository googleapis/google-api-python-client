<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None, datasetId=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new health dataset. Results are returned through the
Operation interface which returns either an
`Operation.response` which contains a Dataset or
`Operation.error`. The metadata
field type is OperationMetadata.
A Google Cloud Platform project can contain up to 500 datasets across all
regions.

Args:
  parent: string, The name of the project where the server creates the dataset. For
example, `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A message representing a health dataset.
    # 
    # A health dataset represents a collection of healthcare data pertaining to one
    # or more patients. This may include multiple modalities of healthcare data,
    # such as electronic medical records or medical imaging data.
  "timeZone": "A String", # The default timezone used by this dataset. Must be a either a valid IANA
      # time zone name such as "America/New_York" or empty, which defaults to UTC.
      # This is used for parsing times in resources, such as HL7 messages, where no
      # explicit timezone is specified.
  "name": "A String", # Output only. Resource name of the dataset, of the form
      # `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}`.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  datasetId: string, The ID of the dataset that is being created.
The string must match the following regex: `[\p{L}\p{N}_\-\.]{1,256}`.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that

  <pre>Creates a new dataset containing de-identified data from the source
dataset. The metadata field type
is OperationMetadata.
If the request is successful, the
response field type is
DeidentifySummary.
If errors occur,
error
details field type is
DeidentifyErrorDetails.
The LRO result may still be successful if de-identification fails for some
DICOM instances. The new de-identified dataset will not contain these
failed resources. Failed resource totals are tracked in
DeidentifySummary.failure_resource_count.
Error details are also logged to Stackdriver Logging. For more information,

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
      # request, the resource, or both.

        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
        # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
        # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
        # request, the resource, or both.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
