  <pre>Commit the dry-run spec for all the Service Perimeters in an Access Policy. A commit operation on a Service Perimeter involves copying its `spec` field to that Service Perimeter&#x27;s `status` field. Only Service Perimeters with `use_explicit_dry_run_spec` field set to true are affected by a commit operation. The longrunning operation from this RPC will have a successful status once the dry-run specs for all the Service Perimeters have been committed. If a commit fails, it will cause the longrunning operation to return an error response and the entire commit operation will be cancelled. When successful, Operation.response field will contain CommitServicePerimetersResponse. The `dry_run` and the `spec` fields will be cleared after a successful commit operation.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Resource name for the parent Access Policy which owns all Service Perimeters in scope for the commit operation. Format: `accessPolicies/{policy_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request to commit dry-run specs in all Service Perimeters belonging to an Access Policy.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The etag for the version of the Access Policy that this commit operation is to be performed on. If, at the time of commit, the etag for the Access Policy stored in Access Context Manager is different from the specified etag, then the commit operation will not be performed and the call will fail. This field is not required. If etag is not provided, the operation will be performed as if a valid etag is provided.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

  <pre>Create a Service Perimeter. The longrunning operation from this RPC will have a successful status once the Service Perimeter has propagated to long-lasting storage. Service Perimeters containing errors will result in an error response for the first error encountered.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Resource name for the access policy which owns this Service Perimeter. Format: `accessPolicies/{policy_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # `ServicePerimeter` describes a set of Google Cloud resources which can freely import and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the `ServicePerimeter`. If a request with a source within this `ServicePerimeter` has a target outside of the `ServicePerimeter`, the request will be blocked. Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single Google Cloud project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service Perimeter Bridges can contain only Google Cloud projects as members, a single Google Cloud project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Description of the `ServicePerimeter` and its use. Does not affect behavior.

  &quot;perimeterType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Perimeter type indicator. A single project is allowed to be a member of single regular perimeter, but multiple service perimeter bridges.

For example, an EgressPolicy can be used to allow VMs on networks within the ServicePerimeter to access a defined set of projects outside the perimeter in certain contexts (e.g. to read data from a Cloud Storage bucket or query against a BigQuery dataset).
