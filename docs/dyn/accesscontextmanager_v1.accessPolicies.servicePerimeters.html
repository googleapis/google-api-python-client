  <pre>Commit the dry-run spec for all the Service Perimeters in an
Access Policy.
A commit operation on a Service Perimeter involves copying its `spec` field
to that Service Perimeter&#x27;s `status` field. Only Service Perimeters with
`use_explicit_dry_run_spec` field set to true are affected by a commit
operation. The longrunning operation from this RPC will have a successful
status once the dry-run specs for all the Service Perimeters have been
committed. If a commit fails, it will cause the longrunning operation to
return an error response and the entire commit operation will be cancelled.
When successful, Operation.response field will contain
CommitServicePerimetersResponse. The `dry_run` and the `spec` fields will
be cleared after a successful commit operation.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Resource name for the parent Access Policy which owns all
Service Perimeters in scope for
the commit operation.

Format: `accessPolicies/{policy_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request to commit dry-run specs in all Service Perimeters belonging to
      # an Access Policy.
    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The etag for the version of the Access Policy that this
        # commit operation is to be performed on. If, at the time of commit, the
        # etag for the Access Policy stored in Access Context Manager is different
        # from the specified etag, then the commit operation will not be performed
        # and the call will fail. This field is not required. If etag is not
        # provided, the operation will be performed as if a valid etag is provided.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  <pre>Replace all existing Service Perimeters in an
Access Policy
with the Service Perimeters provided.
This is done atomically. The longrunning operation from this
RPC will have a successful status once all replacements have propagated to
long-lasting storage. Replacements containing errors will result in an
error response for the first error encountered. Replacement will be
cancelled on error, existing Service Perimeters will not be
affected. Operation.response field will contain
ReplaceServicePerimetersResponse.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Resource name for the access policy which owns these
Service Perimeters.

Format: `accessPolicies/{policy_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

          # has a target outside of the `ServicePerimeter`, the request will be blocked.
