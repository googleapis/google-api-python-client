    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists Executions in the MetadataStore.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The MetadataStore whose Executions should be listed. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/metadataStores/{metadatastore}` (required)
  filter: string, Filter specifying the boolean condition for the Executions to satisfy in order to be part of the result set. The syntax to define filter query is based on https://google.aip.dev/160. Following are the supported set of filters: * **Attribute filtering**: For example: `display_name = &quot;test&quot;`. Supported fields include: `name`, `display_name`, `state`, `schema_title`, `create_time`, and `update_time`. Time fields, such as `create_time` and `update_time`, require values specified in RFC-3339 format. For example: `create_time = &quot;2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00&quot;`. * **Metadata field**: To filter on metadata fields use traversal operation as follows: `metadata..` For example: `metadata.field_1.number_value = 10.0` In case the field name contains special characters (such as colon), one can embed it inside double quote. For example: `metadata.&quot;field:1&quot;.number_value = 10.0` * **Context based filtering**: To filter Executions based on the contexts to which they belong use the function operator with the full resource name: `in_context()`. For example: `in_context(&quot;projects//locations//metadataStores//contexts/&quot;)` Each of the above supported filters can be combined together using logical operators (`AND` &amp; `OR`). Maximum nested expression depth allowed is 5. For example: `display_name = &quot;test&quot; AND metadata.field1.bool_value = true`.
  orderBy: string, How the list of messages is ordered. Specify the values to order by and an ordering operation. The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, users append a &quot; desc&quot; suffix; for example: &quot;foo desc, bar&quot;. Subfields are specified with a `.` character, such as foo.bar. see https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering for more details.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of Executions to return. The service may return fewer. Must be in range 1-1000, inclusive. Defaults to 100.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous MetadataService.ListExecutions call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other provided parameters must match the call that provided the page token. (Otherwise the request will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="purge">purge(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Purges Executions.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The metadata store to purge Executions from. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/metadataStores/{metadatastore}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for MetadataService.PurgeExecutions.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A required filter matching the Executions to be purged. E.g., `update_time &lt;= 2020-11-19T11:30:00-04:00`.
  &quot;force&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Flag to indicate to actually perform the purge. If `force` is set to false, the method will return a sample of Execution names that would be deleted.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
