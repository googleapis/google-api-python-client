Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values &lt; 0.25 or &gt; 4.0 will return an error.

If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement.

If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there&#x27;s usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that.
