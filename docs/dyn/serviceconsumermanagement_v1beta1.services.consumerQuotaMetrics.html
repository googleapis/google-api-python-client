Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the quota metric, returned by a ListConsumerQuotaMetrics call. An example name would be: `services/compute.googleapis.com/projects/123/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus` (required)
  view: string, Specifies the level of detail for quota information in the response.
    Allowed values
      QUOTA_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - No quota view specified. Requests that do not specify a quota view will typically default to the BASIC view.
      BASIC - Only buckets with overrides are shown in the response.
      FULL - Include per-location buckets even if they do not have overrides. When the view is FULL, and a limit has regional or zonal quota, the limit will include buckets for all regions or zones that could support overrides, even if none are currently present. In some cases this will cause the response to become very large; callers that do not need this extra information should use the BASIC view instead.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a summary of all quota information about this consumer that is visible to the service producer, for each quota metric defined by the service. Each metric includes information about all of its defined limits. Each limit includes the limit configuration (quota unit, preciseness, default value), the current effective limit value, and all of the overrides applied to the limit.

Args:
  parent: string, Parent of the quotas resource. An example parent would be: `services/serviceconsumermanagement.googleapis.com/projects/123` (required)
  pageSize: integer, Requested size of the next page of data.
  pageToken: string, Token identifying which result to start with; returned by a previous list call.
  view: string, Specifies the level of detail for quota information in the response.
    Allowed values
      QUOTA_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - No quota view specified. Requests that do not specify a quota view will typically default to the BASIC view.
      BASIC - Only buckets with overrides are shown in the response.
      FULL - Include per-location buckets even if they do not have overrides. When the view is FULL, and a limit has regional or zonal quota, the limit will include buckets for all regions or zones that could support overrides, even if none are currently present. In some cases this will cause the response to become very large; callers that do not need this extra information should use the BASIC view instead.
