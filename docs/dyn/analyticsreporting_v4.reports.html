The date ranges should be aligned for cohort requests. If the request contains `ga:cohortNthDay` it should be exactly one day long, if `ga:cohortNthWeek` it should be aligned to the week boundary (starting at Sunday and ending Saturday), and for `ga:cohortNthMonth` the date range should be aligned to the month (starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month). For LTV requests there are no such restrictions. You do not need to supply a date range for the `reportsRequest.dateRanges` field.

When the lifetimeValue is true: - The metric values will correspond to the values in the web interface LifeTime value report. - The Lifetime Value report shows you how user value (Revenue) and engagement (Appviews, Goal Completions, Sessions, and Session Duration) grow during the 90 days after a user is acquired. - The metrics are calculated as a cumulative average per user per the time increment. - The cohort definition date ranges need not be aligned to the calendar week and month boundaries. - The `viewId` must be an [app view ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2649553#WebVersusAppViews)

The `reportRequest.dateRanges` field should not be specified for cohorts or Lifetime value requests. If a date range is not provided, the default date range is (startDate: current date - 7 days, endDate: current date - 1 day).
