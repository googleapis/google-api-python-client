<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addPeering">addPeering(project, network, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds a peering to the specified network.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  network: string, Name of the network resource to add peering to. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "networkPeering": { # A network peering attached to a network resource. The message includes the peering name, peer network, peering state, and a flag indicating whether Google Compute Engine should automatically create routes for the peering. # Network peering parameters. In order to specify route policies for peering using import and export custom routes, you must specify all peering related parameters (name, peer network, exchange_subnet_routes) in the network_peering field. The corresponding fields in NetworksAddPeeringRequest will be deprecated soon.
      "network": "A String", # The URL of the peer network. It can be either full URL or partial URL. The peer network may belong to a different project. If the partial URL does not contain project, it is assumed that the peer network is in the same project as the current network.
      "autoCreateRoutes": True or False, # This field will be deprecated soon. Use the exchange_subnet_routes field instead. Indicates whether full mesh connectivity is created and managed automatically. When it is set to true, Google Compute Engine will automatically create and manage the routes between two networks when the state is ACTIVE. Otherwise, user needs to create routes manually to route packets to peer network.
      "stateDetails": "A String", # [Output Only] Details about the current state of the peering.
      "state": "A String", # [Output Only] State for the peering, either `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`. The peering is `ACTIVE` when there's a matching configuration in the peer network.
      "exchangeSubnetRoutes": True or False, # Whether full mesh connectivity is created and managed automatically. When it is set to true, Google Compute Engine will automatically create and manage the routes between two networks when the peering state is ACTIVE. Otherwise, user needs to create routes manually to route packets to peer network.
      "name": "A String", # Name of this peering. Provided by the client when the peering is created. The name must comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`. The first character must be a lowercase letter, and all the following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
    },
    "peerNetwork": "A String", # URL of the peer network. It can be either full URL or partial URL. The peer network may belong to a different project. If the partial URL does not contain project, it is assumed that the peer network is in the same project as the current network.
    "name": "A String", # Name of the peering, which should conform to RFC1035.
    "autoCreateRoutes": True or False, # This field will be deprecated soon. Use exchange_subnet_routes in network_peering instead. Whether Google Compute Engine manages the routes automatically.
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of networks available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Contains a list of networks.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="removePeering">removePeering(project, network, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Removes a peering from the specified network.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  network: string, Name of the network resource to remove peering from. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "name": "A String", # Name of the peering, which should conform to RFC1035.
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:
