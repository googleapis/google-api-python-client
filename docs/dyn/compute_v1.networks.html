Currently this field should always be true since Google Compute Engine will automatically create and manage subnetwork routes between two networks when peering state is ACTIVE.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the peering, which should conform to RFC1035.
  &quot;networkPeering&quot;: { # A network peering attached to a network resource. The message includes the peering name, peer network, peering state, and a flag indicating whether Google Compute Engine should automatically create routes for the peering. # Network peering parameters. In order to specify route policies for peering using import and export custom routes, you must specify all peering related parameters (name, peer network, exchange_subnet_routes) in the network_peering field. The corresponding fields in NetworksAddPeeringRequest will be deprecated soon.
    &quot;autoCreateRoutes&quot;: True or False, # This field will be deprecated soon. Use the exchange_subnet_routes field instead.

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of networks available to the specified project.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

  <pre>Lists the peering routes exchanged over peering connection.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  network: string, Name of the network for this request. (required)
  direction: string, The direction of the exchanged routes.
    Allowed values
      INCOMING - For routes exported from peer network.
      OUTGOING - For routes exported from local network.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  peeringName: string, The response will show routes exchanged over the given peering connection.
  region: string, The region of the request. The response will include all subnet routes, static routes and dynamic routes in the region.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="removePeering">removePeering(project, network, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Removes a peering from the specified network.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  network: string, Name of the network resource to remove peering from. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of the peering, which should conform to RFC1035.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="updatePeering">updatePeering(project, network, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the specified network peering with the data included in the request. You can only modify the NetworkPeering.export_custom_routes field and the NetworkPeering.import_custom_routes field.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  network: string, Name of the network resource which the updated peering is belonging to. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;networkPeering&quot;: { # A network peering attached to a network resource. The message includes the peering name, peer network, peering state, and a flag indicating whether Google Compute Engine should automatically create routes for the peering.
    &quot;autoCreateRoutes&quot;: True or False, # This field will be deprecated soon. Use the exchange_subnet_routes field instead. Indicates whether full mesh connectivity is created and managed automatically between peered networks. Currently this field should always be true since Google Compute Engine will automatically create and manage subnetwork routes between two networks when peering state is ACTIVE.
    &quot;exchangeSubnetRoutes&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether full mesh connectivity is created and managed automatically between peered networks. Currently this field should always be true since Google Compute Engine will automatically create and manage subnetwork routes between two networks when peering state is ACTIVE.
    &quot;exportCustomRoutes&quot;: True or False, # Whether to export the custom routes to peer network. The default value is false.
    &quot;exportSubnetRoutesWithPublicIp&quot;: True or False, # Whether subnet routes with public IP range are exported. The default value is true, all subnet routes are exported. IPv4 special-use ranges are always exported to peers and are not controlled by this field.
    &quot;importCustomRoutes&quot;: True or False, # Whether to import the custom routes from peer network. The default value is false.
    &quot;importSubnetRoutesWithPublicIp&quot;: True or False, # Whether subnet routes with public IP range are imported. The default value is false. IPv4 special-use ranges are always imported from peers and are not controlled by this field.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Name of this peering. Provided by the client when the peering is created. The name must comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`. The first character must be a lowercase letter, and all the following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
    &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URL of the peer network. It can be either full URL or partial URL. The peer network may belong to a different project. If the partial URL does not contain project, it is assumed that the peer network is in the same project as the current network.
    &quot;peerMtu&quot;: 42, # Maximum Transmission Unit in bytes.
    &quot;stackType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Which IP version(s) of traffic and routes are allowed to be imported or exported between peer networks. The default value is IPV4_ONLY.
    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] State for the peering, either `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`. The peering is `ACTIVE` when there&#x27;s a matching configuration in the peer network.
    &quot;stateDetails&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Details about the current state of the peering.
  },
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents an Operation resource. Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
