  &quot;deploymentResourcePool&quot;: { # A description of resources that can be shared by multiple DeployedModels, whose underlying specification consists of a DedicatedResources. # Required. The DeploymentResourcePool to create.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when this DeploymentResourcePool was created.
    &quot;dedicatedResources&quot;: { # A description of resources that are dedicated to a DeployedModel, and that need a higher degree of manual configuration. # Required. The underlying DedicatedResources that the DeploymentResourcePool uses.

The metric specifications that overrides a resource utilization metric (CPU utilization, accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle, and so on) target value (default to 60 if not set). At most one entry is allowed per metric. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is above 0, the autoscaling will be based on both CPU utilization and accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle metrics and scale up when either metrics exceeds its target value while scale down if both metrics are under their target value. The default target value is 60 for both metrics. If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target value 60 if not explicitly set. For example, in the case of Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU utilization to 80, you should set autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization` and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to `80`.
        { # The metric specification that defines the target resource utilization (CPU utilization, accelerator&#x27;s duty cycle, and so on) for calculating the desired replica count.
          &quot;metricName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource metric name. Supported metrics: * For Online Prediction: * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/accelerator/duty_cycle` * `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization`
          &quot;target&quot;: 42, # The target resource utilization in percentage (1% - 100%) for the given metric; once the real usage deviates from the target by a certain percentage, the machine replicas change. The default value is 60 (representing 60%) if not provided.
        },

        &quot;acceleratorType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of accelerator(s) that may be attached to the machine as per accelerator_count.
        &quot;machineType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The type of the machine. See the [list of machine types supported for prediction](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/configure-compute#machine-types) See the [list of machine types supported for custom training](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/configure-compute#machine-types). For DeployedModel this field is optional, and the default value is `n1-standard-2`. For BatchPredictionJob or as part of WorkerPoolSpec this field is required.

Immutable. Configuration controlling how this resource pool consumes reservation.

      },
      &quot;maxReplicaCount&quot;: 42, # Immutable. The maximum number of replicas this DeployedModel may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, will use min_replica_count as the default value. The value of this field impacts the charge against Vertex CPU and GPU quotas.

Please note that the logs incur cost, which are subject to [Cloud Logging pricing](https://cloud.google.com/logging/pricing). User can disable container logging by setting this flag to true.
    &quot;encryptionSpec&quot;: { # Represents a customer-managed encryption key spec that can be applied to a top-level resource. # Customer-managed encryption key spec for a DeploymentResourcePool. If set, this DeploymentResourcePool will be secured by this key. Endpoints and the DeploymentResourcePool they deploy in need to have the same EncryptionSpec.
      &quot;kmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer managed encryption key used to protect a resource. Has the form: `projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key`. The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. The resource name of the DeploymentResourcePool. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/deploymentResourcePools/{deployment_resource_pool}`

    &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The service account that the DeploymentResourcePool&#x27;s container(s) run as. Specify the email address of the service account. If this service account is not specified, the container(s) run as a service account that doesn&#x27;t have access to the resource project. Users deploying the Models to this DeploymentResourcePool must have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission on this service account.
