              # # JSON Mapping
              #
              # In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z" where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
              #
              # For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
              #
              # In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString] method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted to this format using [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.

        "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be: # An error explaining why the thumbnail could not be rendered.
            #
            # - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
            #
            # # Overview
            #
            # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][], but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
            #
            # # Language mapping
            #
            # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
            #
            # # Other uses
            #
            # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments.
            #
            # Example uses of this error model include:
            #
            # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial errors.
            #
            # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a `Status` message for error reporting.
            #
            # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response.
            #
            # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the `Status` message.
            #
            # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
          "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the [google.rpc.Status.details][] field, or localized by the client.
          "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][].
          "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There will be a common set of message types for APIs to use.
            { # `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message.
                #
                # Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.
                #
                # Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.
                #
                # Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... }
                #
                # Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.
                #
                # Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); }
                #
                # Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.
                #
                # foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ...
                #
                # Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go
                #
                # foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo) ... foo := &pb.Foo{} if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil { ... }
                #
                # The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type name "y.z".
                #
                #
                #
                # JSON ==== The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:
                #
                # package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; }
                #
                # { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person", "firstName": , "lastName":  }
                #
                # If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):
                #
                # { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration", "value": "1.212s" }
              "typeUrl": "A String", # A URL/resource name whose content describes the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                  #
                  # For URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, the following restrictions and interpretations apply:
                  #
                  # * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading "." is not accepted). * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][] value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.)
                  #
                  # Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics.
              "value": "A String", # Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type.
