Args:
  completionConfig: string, Required. The completion_config of the parent dataStore or engine resource name for which the completion is performed, such as `projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/*/completionConfig` `projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/*/completionConfig`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CompletionService.AdvancedCompleteQuery method. .
  &quot;boostSpec&quot;: { # Specification to boost suggestions based on the condtion of the suggestion. # Optional. Specification to boost suggestions matching the condition.
    &quot;conditionBoostSpecs&quot;: [ # Condition boost specifications. If a suggestion matches multiple conditions in the specifictions, boost values from these specifications are all applied and combined in a non-linear way. Maximum number of specifications is 20. Note: Currently only support language condition boost.
      { # Boost applies to suggestions which match a condition.
        &quot;boost&quot;: 3.14, # Strength of the boost, which should be in [-1, 1]. Negative boost means demotion. Default is 0.0. Setting to 1.0 gives the suggestions a big promotion. However, it does not necessarily mean that the top result will be a boosted suggestion. Setting to -1.0 gives the suggestions a big demotion. However, other suggestions that are relevant might still be shown. Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored.
        &quot;condition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An expression which specifies a boost condition. The syntax is the same as [filter expression syntax](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/filter-search-metadata#filter-expression-syntax). Currently, the only supported condition is a list of BCP-47 lang codes. Example: * To boost suggestions in languages `en` or `fr`: `(lang_code: ANY(&quot;en&quot;, &quot;fr&quot;))`
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;includeTailSuggestions&quot;: True or False, # Indicates if tail suggestions should be returned if there are no suggestions that match the full query. Even if set to true, if there are suggestions that match the full query, those are returned and no tail suggestions are returned.
  &quot;query&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The typeahead input used to fetch suggestions. Maximum length is 128 characters. The query can not be empty for most of the suggestion types. If it is empty, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. The exception is when the suggestion_types contains only the type `RECENT_SEARCH`, the query can be an empty string. The is called &quot;zero prefix&quot; feature, which returns user&#x27;s recently searched queries given the empty query.
  &quot;queryModel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the autocomplete data model. This overrides any model specified in the Configuration &gt; Autocomplete section of the Cloud console. Currently supported values: * `document` - Using suggestions generated from user-imported documents. * `search-history` - Using suggestions generated from the past history of SearchService.Search API calls. Do not use it when there is no traffic for Search API. * `user-event` - Using suggestions generated from user-imported search events. * `document-completable` - Using suggestions taken directly from user-imported document fields marked as completable. Default values: * `document` is the default model for regular dataStores. * `search-history` is the default model for site search dataStores.
  &quot;suggestionTypes&quot;: [ # Optional. Suggestion types to return. If empty or unspecified, query suggestions are returned. Only one suggestion type is supported at the moment.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;userInfo&quot;: { # Information of an end user. # Optional. Information about the end user. This should be the same identifier information as UserEvent.user_info and SearchRequest.user_info.
    &quot;userAgent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User agent as included in the HTTP header. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. This should not be set when using the client side event reporting with GTM or JavaScript tag in UserEventService.CollectUserEvent or if UserEvent.direct_user_request is set.
    &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Highly recommended for logged-in users. Unique identifier for logged-in user, such as a user name. Don&#x27;t set for anonymous users. Always use a hashed value for this ID. Don&#x27;t set the field to the same fixed ID for different users. This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
  },
  &quot;userPseudoId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique identifier for tracking visitors. For example, this could be implemented with an HTTP cookie, which should be able to uniquely identify a visitor on a single device. This unique identifier should not change if the visitor logs in or out of the website. This field should NOT have a fixed value such as `unknown_visitor`. This should be the same identifier as UserEvent.user_pseudo_id and SearchRequest.user_pseudo_id. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
