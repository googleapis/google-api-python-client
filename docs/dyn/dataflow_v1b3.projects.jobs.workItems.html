  <pre>Reports the status of dataflow WorkItems leased by a worker.

Args:
  projectId: string, The project which owns the WorkItem's job. (required)
  jobId: string, The job which the WorkItem is part of. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to report the status of WorkItems.
    "workerId": "A String", # The ID of the worker reporting the WorkItem status. If this does not match the ID of the worker which the Dataflow service believes currently has the lease on the WorkItem, the report will be dropped (with an error response).
    "currentWorkerTime": "A String", # The current timestamp at the worker.
    "workItemStatuses": [ # The order is unimportant, except that the order of the WorkItemServiceState messages in the ReportWorkItemStatusResponse corresponds to the order of WorkItemStatus messages here.
      { # Conveys a worker's progress through the work described by a WorkItem.
        "reportIndex": "A String", # The report index. When a WorkItem is leased, the lease will contain an initial report index. When a WorkItem's status is reported to the system, the report should be sent with that report index, and the response will contain the index the worker should use for the next report. Reports received with unexpected index values will be rejected by the service. In order to preserve idempotency, the worker should not alter the contents of a report, even if the worker must submit the same report multiple times before getting back a response. The worker should not submit a subsequent report until the response for the previous report had been received from the service.
        "errors": [ # Specifies errors which occurred during processing. If errors are provided, and completed = true, then the WorkItem is considered to have failed.
          { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be: - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs # Overview The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code][], but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions. # Language mapping The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C. # Other uses The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments. Example uses of this error model include: - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial errors. - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose. - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response. - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the `Status` message. - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

The value can be either the end position, a key (used with ordered collections), a byte offset, or a record index. # A worker may split an active map task in two parts, "primary" and "residual", continuing to process the primary part and returning the residual part into the pool of available work. This event is called a "dynamic split" and is critical to the dynamic work rebalancing feature. The two obtained sub-tasks are called "parts" of the split. The parts, if concatenated, must represent the same input as would be read by the current task if the split did not happen. The exact way in which the original task is decomposed into the two parts is specified either as a position demarcating them (stop_position), or explicitly as two DerivedSources, if this task consumes a user-defined source type (dynamic_source_split). The "current" task is adjusted as a result of the split: after a task with range [A, B) sends a stop_position update at C, its range is considered to be [A, C), e.g.: * Progress should be interpreted relative to the new range, e.g. "75% completed" means "75% of [A, C) completed" * The worker should interpret proposed_stop_position relative to the new range, e.g. "split at 68%" should be interpreted as "split at 68% of [A, C)". * If the worker chooses to split again using stop_position, only stop_positions in [A, C) will be accepted. * Etc. dynamic_source_split has similar semantics: e.g., if a task with source S splits using dynamic_source_split into {P, R} (where P and R must be together equivalent to S), then subsequent progress and proposed_stop_position should be interpreted relative to P, and in a potential subsequent dynamic_source_split into {P', R'}, P' and R' must be together equivalent to P, etc.

However, for efficiency, a file splitter may decide to produce file subranges directly from the filepattern to avoid a splitting round-trip.
