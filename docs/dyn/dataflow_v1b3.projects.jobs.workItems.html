<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="reportStatus">reportStatus(projectId, jobId, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Reports the status of dataflow WorkItems leased by a worker.

Args:
  projectId: string, The project which owns the WorkItem's job. (required)
  jobId: string, The job which the WorkItem is part of. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to report the status of WorkItems.
    "workerId": "A String", # The ID of the worker reporting the WorkItem status.  If this
        # does not match the ID of the worker which the Dataflow service
        # believes currently has the lease on the WorkItem, the report
        # will be dropped (with an error response).
    "currentWorkerTime": "A String", # The current timestamp at the worker.
    "workItemStatuses": [ # The order is unimportant, except that the order of the
        # WorkItemServiceState messages in the ReportWorkItemStatusResponse
        # corresponds to the order of WorkItemStatus messages here.
      { # Conveys a worker's progress through the work described by a WorkItem.
        "reportIndex": "A String", # The report index.  When a WorkItem is leased, the lease will
            # contain an initial report index.  When a WorkItem's status is
            # reported to the system, the report should be sent with
            # that report index, and the response will contain the index the
            # worker should use for the next report.  Reports received with
            # unexpected index values will be rejected by the service.
            #
            # In order to preserve idempotency, the worker should not alter the
            # contents of a report, even if the worker must submit the same
            # report multiple times before getting back a response.  The worker
            # should not submit a subsequent report until the response for the
            # previous report had been received from the service.
        "errors": [ # Specifies errors which occurred during processing.  If errors are
            # provided, and completed = true, then the WorkItem is considered
            # to have failed.
          { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
              # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
              # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
              #
              # - Simple to use and understand for most users
              # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
              #
              # # Overview
              #
              # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
              # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
              # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
              # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
              # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
              # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
              # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
              # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
              # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
              #
              # # Language mapping
              #
              # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
              # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
              # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
              # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
              # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
              #
              # # Other uses
              #
              # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
              # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
              # consistent developer experience across different environments.
              #
              # Example uses of this error model include:
              #
              # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
              #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
              #     errors.
              #
              # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
              #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
              #
              # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
              #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
              #     each error sub-response.
              #
              # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
              #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
              #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
              #
              # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
              #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
