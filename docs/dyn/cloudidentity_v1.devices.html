  <pre>Cancels an unfinished device wipe. This operation can be used to cancel device wipe in the gap between the wipe operation returning success and the device being wiped. This operation is possible when the device is in a &quot;pending wipe&quot; state. The device enters the &quot;pending wipe&quot; state when a wipe device command is issued, but has not yet been sent to the device. The cancel wipe will fail if the wipe command has already been issued to the device.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
        </pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="wipe">wipe(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Wipes all data on the specified device.

Args:
  name: string, Required. [Resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the Device in format: `devices/{device}/deviceUsers/{device_user}`, where device is the unique ID assigned to the Device, and device_user is the unique ID assigned to the User. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for wiping all data on the device.
  &quot;customer&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. [Resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the customer. If you&#x27;re using this API for your own organization, use `customers/my_customer` If you&#x27;re using this API to manage another organization, use `customers/{customer}`, where customer is the customer to whom the device belongs.
  &quot;removeResetLock&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Specifies if a user is able to factory reset a device after a Device Wipe. On iOS, this is called &quot;Activation Lock&quot;, while on Android, this is known as &quot;Factory Reset Protection&quot;. If true, this protection will be removed from the device, so that a user can successfully factory reset. If false, the setting is untouched on the device.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
