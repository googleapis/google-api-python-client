<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a ServiceAccount.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
the account. The `ACCOUNT` value can be the `email` address or the
`unique_id` of the service account. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="disable">disable(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>DisableServiceAccount is currently in the alpha launch stage.

Disables a ServiceAccount,
which immediately prevents the service account from authenticating and
gaining access to APIs.

Disabled service accounts can be safely restored by using
EnableServiceAccount at any point. Deleted service accounts cannot be
restored using this method.

Disabling a service account that is bound to VMs, Apps, Functions, or
other jobs will cause those jobs to lose access to resources if they are
using the disabled service account.

To improve reliability of your services and avoid unexpected outages, it
is recommended to first disable a service account rather than delete it.
After disabling the service account, wait at least 24 hours to verify there
are no unintended consequences, and then delete the service account.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
the account. The `ACCOUNT` value can be the `email` address or the
`unique_id` of the service account. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account disable request.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="enable">enable(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>EnableServiceAccount is currently in the alpha launch stage.

 Restores a disabled ServiceAccount
 that has been manually disabled by using DisableServiceAccount. Service
 accounts that have been disabled by other means or for other reasons,
 such as abuse, cannot be restored using this method.

 EnableServiceAccount will have no effect on a service account that is
 not disabled.  Enabling an already enabled service account will have no
 effect.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
the account. The `ACCOUNT` value can be the `email` address or the
`unique_id` of the service account. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account enable request.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, options_requestedPolicyVersion=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the Cloud IAM access control policy for a
ServiceAccount.

Note: Service accounts are both
[resources and
identities](/iam/docs/service-accounts#service_account_permissions). This
method treats the service account as a resource. It returns the Cloud IAM
policy that reflects what members have access to the service account.

This method does not return what resources the service account has access
to. To see if a service account has access to a resource, call the
`getIamPolicy` method on the target resource. For example, to view grants
for a project, call the
[projects.getIamPolicy](/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/getIamPolicy)
method.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  options_requestedPolicyVersion: integer, Optional. The policy format version to be returned.

Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
rejected.

Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.
Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
leave the field unset.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.
        #
        # Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value
        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

          #

    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the Cloud IAM access control policy for a
ServiceAccount.

Note: Service accounts are both
[resources and
identities](/iam/docs/service-accounts#service_account_permissions). This
method treats the service account as a resource. Use it to grant members
access to the service account, such as when they need to impersonate it.

This method does not grant the service account access to other resources,
such as projects. To grant a service account access to resources, include
the service account in the Cloud IAM policy for the desired resource, then
call the appropriate `setIamPolicy` method on the target resource. For
example, to grant a service account access to a project, call the
[projects.setIamPolicy](/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy)
method.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `SetIamPolicy` method.
    &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`. The size of
        # the policy is limited to a few 10s of KB. An empty policy is a
        # valid policy but certain Cloud Platform services (such as Projects)
        # might reject them.
        # controls for Google Cloud resources.
        #
        #
        # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
        # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
        # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        # custom role.
        #
        # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
        # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
        # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
        # request, the resource, or both.

      &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
          # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
          # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
          # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
          # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
          # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
          # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
          #
          # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
          # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
          # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

          #
          # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
          # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
          #
          # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
          # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
          # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy

      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
      # request, the resource, or both.

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy.
        #
        # Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value
        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.
