<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a ServiceAccount.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
the account. The `ACCOUNT` value can be the `email` address or the

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:

  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="disable">disable(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>DisableServiceAccount is currently in the alpha launch stage.

Disables a ServiceAccount,
which immediately prevents the service account from authenticating and
gaining access to APIs.

Disabled service accounts can be safely restored by using
EnableServiceAccount at any point. Deleted service accounts cannot be
restored using this method.

Disabling a service account that is bound to VMs, Apps, Functions, or
other jobs will cause those jobs to lose access to resources if they are
using the disabled service account.

To improve reliability of your services and avoid unexpected outages, it
is recommended to first disable a service account rather than delete it.
After disabling the service account, wait at least 24 hours to verify there
are no unintended consequences, and then delete the service account.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
the account. The `ACCOUNT` value can be the `email` address or the
`unique_id` of the service account. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account disable request.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:

      #     service Foo {

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="enable">enable(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>EnableServiceAccount is currently in the alpha launch stage.

 Restores a disabled ServiceAccount
 that has been manually disabled by using DisableServiceAccount. Service
 accounts that have been disabled by other means or for other reasons,
 such as abuse, cannot be restored using this method.

 EnableServiceAccount will have no effect on a service account that is
 not disabled.  Enabling an already enabled service account will have no
 effect.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_ID}'.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
the account. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account enable request.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns the Cloud IAM access control policy for a
ServiceAccount.

Note: Service accounts are both
[resources and
identities](/iam/docs/service-accounts#service_account_permissions). This
method treats the service account as a resource. It returns the Cloud IAM
policy that reflects what members have access to the service account.

This method does not return what resources the service account has access
to. To see if a service account has access to a resource, call the
`getIamPolicy` method on the target resource. For example, to view grants
for a project, call the
[projects.getIamPolicy](/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/getIamPolicy)
method.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)

Note: Service accounts are both

method treats the service account as a resource. Use it to grant members
access to the service account, such as when they need to impersonate it.

such as projects. To grant a service account access to resources, include
the service account in the Cloud IAM policy for the desired resource, then
call the appropriate `setIamPolicy` method on the target resource. For
example, to grant a service account access to a project, call the
[projects.setIamPolicy](/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy)
method.

  <pre>**Note**: This method is in the process of being deprecated. Call the
[`signBlob()`](/iam/credentials/reference/rest/v1/projects.serviceAccounts/signBlob)
method of the Cloud IAM Service Account Credentials API instead.

Signs a blob using a service account's system-managed private key.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
the account. The `ACCOUNT` value can be the `email` address or the
`unique_id` of the service account. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account sign blob request.
    "bytesToSign": "A String", # The bytes to sign.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The service account sign blob response.
    "keyId": "A String", # The id of the key used to sign the blob.
    "signature": "A String", # The signed blob.

an expiry time of one hour by default. If you request an expiry time of
more than one hour, the request will fail.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
