The request throws a 400 error if 'personFields' is not specified.

Args:
  resourceName: string, The resource name to return connections for. Only `people/me` is valid. (required)
  pageSize: integer, The number of connections to include in the response. Valid values are
between 1 and 2000, inclusive. Defaults to 100.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  pageToken: string, The token of the page to be returned.
  sortOrder: string, The order in which the connections should be sorted. Defaults to
`LAST_MODIFIED_ASCENDING`.
  personFields: string, **Required.** A field mask to restrict which fields on each person are
returned. Multiple fields can be specified by separating them with commas.
Valid values are:

* addresses
* ageRanges
* biographies

  requestSyncToken: boolean, Whether the response should include a sync token, which can be used to get
all changes since the last request. For subsequent sync requests use the
`sync_token` param instead. Initial sync requests that specify
`request_sync_token` have an additional rate limit.
  syncToken: string, A sync token returned by a previous call to `people.connections.list`.
Only resources changed since the sync token was created will be returned.
Sync requests that specify `sync_token` have an additional rate limit.
  requestMask_includeField: string, **Required.** Comma-separated list of person fields to be included in the
response. Each path should start with `person.`: for example,
`person.names` or `person.photos`.
