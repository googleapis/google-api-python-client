<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(resourceName, pageToken=None, sortOrder=None, personFields=None, syncToken=None, pageSize=None, requestMask_includeField=None, requestSyncToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Provides a list of the authenticated user&#x27;s contacts merged with any
connected profiles.

The request throws a 400 error if &#x27;personFields&#x27; is not specified.

Args:
  resourceName: string, Required. The resource name to return connections for. Only `people/me` is valid. (required)
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListConnections` call.
Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page.

When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListConnections`
must match the call that provided the page token.
  sortOrder: string, Optional. The order in which the connections should be sorted. Defaults to
`LAST_MODIFIED_ASCENDING`.
  personFields: string, Required. A field mask to restrict which fields on each person are returned. Multiple
fields can be specified by separating them with commas. Valid values are:

* addresses
* ageRanges
* biographies
* birthdays
* coverPhotos
* emailAddresses
* events
* genders
* imClients
* interests
* locales
* memberships
* metadata
* names
* nicknames
* occupations
* organizations
* phoneNumbers
* photos
* relations
* residences
* sipAddresses
* skills
* urls
* userDefined
  syncToken: string, Optional. A sync token, received from a previous `ListConnections` call.
Provide this to retrieve only the resources changed since the last request.
Sync requests that specify `sync_token` have an additional rate limit.

When syncing, all other parameters provided to `ListConnections`
must match the call that provided the sync token.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The number of connections to include in the response. Valid values are
between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Defaults to 100 if not set or set to 0.
  requestMask_includeField: string, Required. Comma-separated list of person fields to be included in the response. Each
path should start with `person.`: for example, `person.names` or
`person.photos`.
  requestSyncToken: boolean, Optional. Whether the response should include `next_sync_token`, which can be used to
get all changes since the last request. For subsequent sync requests use
the `sync_token` param instead. Initial sync requests that specify
`request_sync_token` have an additional rate limit.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
