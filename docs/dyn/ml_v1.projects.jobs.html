      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.

      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates

If there are no jobs that match the request parameters, the list
request returns an empty response body: {}.

Args:

You get the token from the `next_page_token` field of the response from
the previous call.

      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, Optional. Specifies the subset of jobs to retrieve.
You can filter on the value of one or more attributes of the job object.
For example, retrieve jobs with a job identifier that starts with 'census':
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gcloud ai-platform jobs list --filter='jobId:census*'&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List all failed jobs with names that start with 'rnn':
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gcloud ai-platform jobs list --filter='jobId:rnn*
AND state:FAILED'&lt;/code&gt;

  updateMask: string, Required. Specifies the path, relative to `Job`, of the field to update.
To adopt etag mechanism, include `etag` field in the mask, and include the
`etag` value in your job resource.

For example, to change the labels of a job, the `update_mask` parameter
would be specified as `labels`, `etag`, and the
`PATCH` request body would specify the new value, as follows:
    {
      "labels": {
         "owner": "Google",
         "color": "Blue"
      }
      "etag": "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
    }
If `etag` matches the one on the server, the labels of the job will be
replaced with the given ones, and the server end `etag` will be
recalculated.

Currently the only supported update masks are `labels` and `etag`.

      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.

      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

        # allowed.
