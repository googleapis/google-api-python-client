    &quot;pythonModule&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The Python module name to run after installing the packages.
    &quot;pythonVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The version of Python used in training. You must either specify this field or specify `masterConfig.imageUri`. The following Python versions are available: * Python &#x27;3.7&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to &#x27;1.15&#x27; or later. * Python &#x27;3.5&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to a version from &#x27;1.4&#x27; to &#x27;1.14&#x27;. * Python &#x27;2.7&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to &#x27;1.15&#x27; or earlier. Read more about the Python versions available for [each runtime version](/ml-engine/docs/runtime-version-list).

For more information, see the [runtime version list](/ai-platform/training/docs/runtime-version-list) and learn [how to manage runtime versions](/ai-platform/training/docs/versioning).
    &quot;scaleTier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Specifies the machine types, the number of replicas for workers and parameter servers.
    &quot;scheduling&quot;: { # All parameters related to scheduling of training jobs. # Optional. Scheduling options for a training job.
      &quot;maxRunningTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job running time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, this field defaults to `604800s` (seven days). If the training job is still running after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. The duration is measured from when the job enters the `RUNNING` state; therefore it does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_wait_time. For example, if you want to ensure your job runs for no more than 2 hours, set this field to `7200s` (2 hours * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxRunningTime: 7200s ```
      &quot;maxWaitTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job wait time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, there is no limit to the wait time. The minimum for this field is `1800s` (30 minutes). If the training job has not entered the `RUNNING` state after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. After the job begins running, it can no longer be cancelled due to the maximum wait time. Therefore the duration limited by this field does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_running_time. For example, if the job temporarily stops running and retries due to a [VM restart](/ai-platform/training/docs/overview#restarts), this cannot lead to a maximum wait time cancellation. However, independently of this constraint, AI Platform Training might stop a job if there are too many retries due to exhausted resources in a region. The following example describes how you might use this field: To cancel your job if it doesn&#x27;t start running within 1 hour, set this field to `3600s` (1 hour * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If the job is still in the `QUEUED` or `PREPARING` state after an hour of waiting, AI Platform Training cancels the job. If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxWaitTime: 3600s ```
      &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Optional. Job scheduling will be based on this priority, which in the range [0, 1000]. The bigger the number, the higher the priority. Default to 0 if not set. If there are multiple jobs requesting same type of accelerators, the high priority job will be scheduled prior to ones with low priority.

    &quot;scheduling&quot;: { # All parameters related to scheduling of training jobs. # Optional. Scheduling options for a training job.
      &quot;maxRunningTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job running time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, this field defaults to `604800s` (seven days). If the training job is still running after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. The duration is measured from when the job enters the `RUNNING` state; therefore it does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_wait_time. For example, if you want to ensure your job runs for no more than 2 hours, set this field to `7200s` (2 hours * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxRunningTime: 7200s ```
      &quot;maxWaitTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job wait time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, there is no limit to the wait time. The minimum for this field is `1800s` (30 minutes). If the training job has not entered the `RUNNING` state after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. After the job begins running, it can no longer be cancelled due to the maximum wait time. Therefore the duration limited by this field does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_running_time. For example, if the job temporarily stops running and retries due to a [VM restart](/ai-platform/training/docs/overview#restarts), this cannot lead to a maximum wait time cancellation. However, independently of this constraint, AI Platform Training might stop a job if there are too many retries due to exhausted resources in a region. The following example describes how you might use this field: To cancel your job if it doesn&#x27;t start running within 1 hour, set this field to `3600s` (1 hour * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If the job is still in the `QUEUED` or `PREPARING` state after an hour of waiting, AI Platform Training cancels the job. If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxWaitTime: 3600s ```
      &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Optional. Job scheduling will be based on this priority, which in the range [0, 1000]. The bigger the number, the higher the priority. Default to 0 if not set. If there are multiple jobs requesting same type of accelerators, the high priority job will be scheduled prior to ones with low priority.

The following Python versions are available: * Python &#x27;3.7&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to &#x27;1.15&#x27; or later. * Python &#x27;3.5&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to a version from &#x27;1.4&#x27; to &#x27;1.14&#x27;. * Python &#x27;2.7&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to &#x27;1.15&#x27; or earlier. Read more about the Python versions available for [each runtime version](/ml-engine/docs/runtime-version-list).

For more information, see the [runtime version list](/ai-platform/training/docs/runtime-version-list) and learn [how to manage runtime versions](/ai-platform/training/docs/versioning).
    &quot;scaleTier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Specifies the machine types, the number of replicas for workers and parameter servers.
    &quot;scheduling&quot;: { # All parameters related to scheduling of training jobs. # Optional. Scheduling options for a training job.
      &quot;maxRunningTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job running time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, this field defaults to `604800s` (seven days). If the training job is still running after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. The duration is measured from when the job enters the `RUNNING` state; therefore it does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_wait_time. For example, if you want to ensure your job runs for no more than 2 hours, set this field to `7200s` (2 hours * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxRunningTime: 7200s ```
      &quot;maxWaitTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job wait time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, there is no limit to the wait time. The minimum for this field is `1800s` (30 minutes). If the training job has not entered the `RUNNING` state after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. After the job begins running, it can no longer be cancelled due to the maximum wait time. Therefore the duration limited by this field does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_running_time. For example, if the job temporarily stops running and retries due to a [VM restart](/ai-platform/training/docs/overview#restarts), this cannot lead to a maximum wait time cancellation. However, independently of this constraint, AI Platform Training might stop a job if there are too many retries due to exhausted resources in a region. The following example describes how you might use this field: To cancel your job if it doesn&#x27;t start running within 1 hour, set this field to `3600s` (1 hour * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If the job is still in the `QUEUED` or `PREPARING` state after an hour of waiting, AI Platform Training cancels the job. If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxWaitTime: 3600s ```
      &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Optional. Job scheduling will be based on this priority, which in the range [0, 1000]. The bigger the number, the higher the priority. Default to 0 if not set. If there are multiple jobs requesting same type of accelerators, the high priority job will be scheduled prior to ones with low priority.

    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, options_requestedPolicyVersion=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  options_requestedPolicyVersion: integer, Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1.

  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

The following Python versions are available: * Python &#x27;3.7&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to &#x27;1.15&#x27; or later. * Python &#x27;3.5&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to a version from &#x27;1.4&#x27; to &#x27;1.14&#x27;. * Python &#x27;2.7&#x27; is available when `runtime_version` is set to &#x27;1.15&#x27; or earlier. Read more about the Python versions available for [each runtime version](/ml-engine/docs/runtime-version-list).

For more information, see the [runtime version list](/ai-platform/training/docs/runtime-version-list) and learn [how to manage runtime versions](/ai-platform/training/docs/versioning).
        &quot;scaleTier&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Specifies the machine types, the number of replicas for workers and parameter servers.
        &quot;scheduling&quot;: { # All parameters related to scheduling of training jobs. # Optional. Scheduling options for a training job.
          &quot;maxRunningTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job running time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, this field defaults to `604800s` (seven days). If the training job is still running after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. The duration is measured from when the job enters the `RUNNING` state; therefore it does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_wait_time. For example, if you want to ensure your job runs for no more than 2 hours, set this field to `7200s` (2 hours * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxRunningTime: 7200s ```
          &quot;maxWaitTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job wait time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, there is no limit to the wait time. The minimum for this field is `1800s` (30 minutes). If the training job has not entered the `RUNNING` state after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. After the job begins running, it can no longer be cancelled due to the maximum wait time. Therefore the duration limited by this field does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_running_time. For example, if the job temporarily stops running and retries due to a [VM restart](/ai-platform/training/docs/overview#restarts), this cannot lead to a maximum wait time cancellation. However, independently of this constraint, AI Platform Training might stop a job if there are too many retries due to exhausted resources in a region. The following example describes how you might use this field: To cancel your job if it doesn&#x27;t start running within 1 hour, set this field to `3600s` (1 hour * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If the job is still in the `QUEUED` or `PREPARING` state after an hour of waiting, AI Platform Training cancels the job. If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxWaitTime: 3600s ```
          &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Optional. Job scheduling will be based on this priority, which in the range [0, 1000]. The bigger the number, the higher the priority. Default to 0 if not set. If there are multiple jobs requesting same type of accelerators, the high priority job will be scheduled prior to ones with low priority.
        },
        &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The email address of a service account to use when running the training appplication.

In addition, the AI Platform Training Google-managed service account must have the `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin` role for the specified service account.

If the training job has not entered the `RUNNING` state after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. After the job begins running, it can no longer be cancelled due to the maximum wait time. Therefore the duration limited by this field does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_running_time. For example, if the job temporarily stops running and retries due to a [VM restart](/ai-platform/training/docs/overview#restarts), this cannot lead to a maximum wait time cancellation. However, independently of this constraint, AI Platform Training might stop a job if there are too many retries due to exhausted resources in a region. The following example describes how you might use this field: To cancel your job if it doesn&#x27;t start running within 1 hour, set this field to `3600s` (1 hour * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If the job is still in the `QUEUED` or `PREPARING` state after an hour of waiting, AI Platform Training cancels the job. If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxWaitTime: 3600s ```
      &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Optional. Job scheduling will be based on this priority, which in the range [0, 1000]. The bigger the number, the higher the priority. Default to 0 if not set. If there are multiple jobs requesting same type of accelerators, the high priority job will be scheduled prior to ones with low priority.

    &quot;scheduling&quot;: { # All parameters related to scheduling of training jobs. # Optional. Scheduling options for a training job.
      &quot;maxRunningTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job running time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, this field defaults to `604800s` (seven days). If the training job is still running after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. The duration is measured from when the job enters the `RUNNING` state; therefore it does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_wait_time. For example, if you want to ensure your job runs for no more than 2 hours, set this field to `7200s` (2 hours * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxRunningTime: 7200s ```
      &quot;maxWaitTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum job wait time, expressed in seconds. The field can contain up to nine fractional digits, terminated by `s`. If not specified, there is no limit to the wait time. The minimum for this field is `1800s` (30 minutes). If the training job has not entered the `RUNNING` state after this duration, AI Platform Training cancels it. After the job begins running, it can no longer be cancelled due to the maximum wait time. Therefore the duration limited by this field does not overlap with the duration limited by Scheduling.max_running_time. For example, if the job temporarily stops running and retries due to a [VM restart](/ai-platform/training/docs/overview#restarts), this cannot lead to a maximum wait time cancellation. However, independently of this constraint, AI Platform Training might stop a job if there are too many retries due to exhausted resources in a region. The following example describes how you might use this field: To cancel your job if it doesn&#x27;t start running within 1 hour, set this field to `3600s` (1 hour * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute). If the job is still in the `QUEUED` or `PREPARING` state after an hour of waiting, AI Platform Training cancels the job. If you submit your training job using the `gcloud` tool, you can [specify this field in a `config.yaml` file](/ai-platform/training/docs/training-jobs#formatting_your_configuration_parameters). For example: ```yaml trainingInput: scheduling: maxWaitTime: 3600s ```
      &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Optional. Job scheduling will be based on this priority, which in the range [0, 1000]. The bigger the number, the higher the priority. Default to 0 if not set. If there are multiple jobs requesting same type of accelerators, the high priority job will be scheduled prior to ones with low priority.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the `resource`.
