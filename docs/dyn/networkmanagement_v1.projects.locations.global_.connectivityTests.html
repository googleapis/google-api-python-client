    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, testId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new Connectivity Test.
After you create a test, the reachability analysis is performed as part
of the long running operation, which completes when the analysis completes.

If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are invalid
(for example, containing non-existent resources in the network, or you
don&#x27;t have read permissions to the network configurations of listed
projects), then the reachability result returns a value of `UNKNOWN`.

If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are
incomplete, the reachability result returns a value of
&lt;code&gt;AMBIGUOUS&lt;/code&gt;. For more information,
see the Connectivity Test documentation.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the Connectivity Test to create:
    `projects/{project_id}/locations/global` (required)

  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource.
Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy
set.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  options_requestedPolicyVersion: integer, Optional. The policy format version to be returned.

Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be
rejected.

Requests for policies with any conditional bindings must specify version 3.
Policies without any conditional bindings may specify any valid value or
leave the field unset.

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
[IAM
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageToken=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all Connectivity Tests owned by a project.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the Connectivity Tests:
    `projects/{project_id}/locations/global` (required)
  filter: string, Lists the `ConnectivityTests` that match the filter expression. A filter
expression filters the resources listed in the response. The expression
must be of the form `&lt;field&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;value&gt;` where operators: `&lt;`, `&gt;`,
`&lt;=`,
`&gt;=`,
`!=`, `=`, `:` are supported (colon `:` represents a HAS operator which is
roughly synonymous with equality). &lt;field&gt; can refer to a proto or JSON
field, or a synthetic field. Field names can be camelCase or snake_case.

Examples:
- Filter by name:
  name = &quot;projects/proj-1/locations/global/connectivityTests/test-1

- Filter by labels:
  - Resources that have a key called `foo`
    labels.foo:*
  - Resources that have a key called `foo` whose value is `bar`
    labels.foo = bar
  pageToken: string, Page token from an earlier query, as returned in `next_page_token`.
  orderBy: string, Field to use to sort the list.
  pageSize: integer, Number of `ConnectivityTests` to return.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

  <pre>Updates the configuration of an existing `ConnectivityTest`.
After you update a test, the reachability analysis is performed as part
of the long running operation, which completes when the analysis completes.
The Reachability state in the test resource is updated with the new result.

If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are invalid
(for example, they contain non-existent resources in the network, or the
user does not have read permissions to the network configurations of
listed projects), then the reachability result returns a value of
&lt;code&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/code&gt;.

If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are incomplete, the
reachability result returns a value of `AMBIGUOUS`. See the documentation
in `ConnectivityTest` for for more details.

  name: string, Required. Unique name of the resource using the form:
    `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/connectivityTests/{test_id}` (required)

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="rerun">rerun(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Rerun an existing `ConnectivityTest`.
After the user triggers the rerun, the reachability analysis is performed
as part of the long running operation, which completes when the analysis
completes.

Even though the test configuration remains the same, the reachability
result may change due to underlying network configuration changes.

If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` become invalid (for
example, specified resources are deleted in the network, or you lost
read permissions to the network configurations of listed projects), then
the reachability result returns a value of `UNKNOWN`.

    `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/connectivityTests/{test_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.

      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
        # prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.
        # It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the
        # read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
        # conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
        # systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to
        # ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

        # are rejected.
        #
        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
        # `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:
        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
