  <pre>Creates a new Connectivity Test. After you create a test, the reachability analysis is performed as part of the long running operation, which completes when the analysis completes. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are invalid (for example, containing non-existent resources in the network, or you don&#x27;t have read permissions to the network configurations of listed projects), then the reachability result returns a value of `UNKNOWN`. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are incomplete, the reachability result returns a value of AMBIGUOUS. For more information, see the Connectivity Test documentation.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the Connectivity Test to create: `projects/{project_id}/locations/global` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Connectivity Test for a network reachability analysis.
  &quot;bypassFirewallChecks&quot;: True or False, # Whether the test should skip firewall checking. If not provided, we assume false.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the test was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The user-supplied description of the Connectivity Test. Maximum of 512 characters.
  &quot;destination&quot;: { # Source or destination of the Connectivity Test. # Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test. You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the destination location. Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination endpoint from route information. If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination interface. A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you don&#x27;t intend to test.

You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the source location. Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network information. If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must provide the destination VPC network. If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP address or VPC network. A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that you don&#x27;t intend to test.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination interface. A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you don&#x27;t intend to test.

Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network information. If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must provide the destination VPC network. If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to identify the endpoint.

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the configuration of an existing `ConnectivityTest`. After you update a test, the reachability analysis is performed as part of the long running operation, which completes when the analysis completes. The Reachability state in the test resource is updated with the new result. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are invalid (for example, they contain non-existent resources in the network, or the user does not have read permissions to the network configurations of listed projects), then the reachability result returns a value of UNKNOWN. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are incomplete, the reachability result returns a value of `AMBIGUOUS`. See the documentation in `ConnectivityTest` for more details.

Args:
  name: string, Identifier. Unique name of the resource using the form: `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/connectivityTests/{test_id}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Connectivity Test for a network reachability analysis.
  &quot;bypassFirewallChecks&quot;: True or False, # Whether the test should skip firewall checking. If not provided, we assume false.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the test was created.

  &quot;destination&quot;: { # Source or destination of the Connectivity Test. # Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test. You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the destination location. Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination endpoint from route information. If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination interface. A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you don&#x27;t intend to test.

You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the source location. Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network information. If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must provide the destination VPC network. If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to identify the endpoint.

  &quot;auditConfigs&quot;: [ # Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    { # Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with multiple AuditConfigs: { &quot;audit_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;allServices&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:jose@example.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;ADMIN_READ&quot; } ] }, { &quot;service&quot;: &quot;sampleservice.googleapis.com&quot;, &quot;audit_log_configs&quot;: [ { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_READ&quot; }, { &quot;log_type&quot;: &quot;DATA_WRITE&quot;, &quot;exempted_members&quot;: [ &quot;user:aliya@example.com&quot; ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as `*` or `storage.*`) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).

  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
