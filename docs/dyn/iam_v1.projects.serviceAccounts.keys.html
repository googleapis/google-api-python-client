<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a ServiceAccountKey.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the service account. Use one of the following formats: * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` As an alternative, you can use the `-` wildcard character instead of the project ID: * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` When possible, avoid using the `-` wildcard character, because it can cause response messages to contain misleading error codes. For example, if you try to access the service account `projects/-/serviceAccounts/fake@example.com`, which does not exist, the response contains an HTTP `403 Forbidden` error instead of a `404 Not Found` error. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account key create request.
  &quot;keyAlgorithm&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Which type of key and algorithm to use for the key. The default is currently a 2K RSA key. However this may change in the future.
  &quot;privateKeyType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The output format of the private key. The default value is `TYPE_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, which is the Google Credentials File format.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents a service account key. A service account has two sets of key-pairs: user-managed, and system-managed. User-managed key-pairs can be created and deleted by users. Users are responsible for rotating these keys periodically to ensure security of their service accounts. Users retain the private key of these key-pairs, and Google retains ONLY the public key. System-managed keys are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for signing for a maximum of two weeks. The rotation process is probabilistic, and usage of the new key will gradually ramp up and down over the key&#x27;s lifetime. If you cache the public key set for a service account, we recommend that you update the cache every 15 minutes. User-managed keys can be added and removed at any time, so it is important to update the cache frequently. For Google-managed keys, Google will publish a key at least 6 hours before it is first used for signing and will keep publishing it for at least 6 hours after it was last used for signing. Public keys for all service accounts are also published at the OAuth2 Service Account API.
  &quot;disabled&quot;: True or False, # The key status.
  &quot;keyAlgorithm&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the algorithm (and possibly key size) for the key.
  &quot;keyOrigin&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key origin.
  &quot;keyType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key type.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the service account key in the following format `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}`.
  &quot;privateKeyData&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The private key data. Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey` responses. Make sure to keep the private key data secure because it allows for the assertion of the service account identity. When base64 decoded, the private key data can be used to authenticate with Google API client libraries and with gcloud auth activate-service-account.
  &quot;privateKeyType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The output format for the private key. Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey` responses, not in `GetServiceAccountKey` or `ListServiceAccountKey` responses. Google never exposes system-managed private keys, and never retains user-managed private keys.
  &quot;publicKeyData&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The public key data. Only provided in `GetServiceAccountKey` responses.
  &quot;validAfterTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key can be used after this timestamp.
  &quot;validBeforeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key can be used before this timestamp. For system-managed key pairs, this timestamp is the end time for the private key signing operation. The public key could still be used for verification for a few hours after this time.
