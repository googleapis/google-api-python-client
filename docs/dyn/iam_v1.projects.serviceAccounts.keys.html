<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a ServiceAccountKey
and returns it.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the project will infer the project from
the account. The `account` value can be the `email` address or the
`unique_id` of the service account. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account key create request.
    "includePublicKeyData": True or False,
    "keyAlgorithm": "A String", # Which type of key and algorithm to use for the key.
        # The default is currently a 2K RSA key.  However this may change in the
        # future.
    "privateKeyType": "A String", # The output format of the private key. `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE` is the
        # default output format.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents a service account key.
      #
      # A service account has two sets of key-pairs: user-managed, and
      # system-managed.
      #
      # User-managed key-pairs can be created and deleted by users.  Users are
      # responsible for rotating these keys periodically to ensure security of
      # their service accounts.  Users retain the private key of these key-pairs,
      # and Google retains ONLY the public key.
      #
      # System-managed key-pairs are managed automatically by Google, and rotated
      # daily without user intervention.  The private key never leaves Google's
      # servers to maximize security.
      #
      # Public keys for all service accounts are also published at the OAuth2
      # Service Account API.
    "name": "A String", # The resource name of the service account key in the following format
        # `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}/keys/{key}`.
    "validBeforeTime": "A String", # The key can be used before this timestamp.
    "keyAlgorithm": "A String", # Specifies the algorithm (and possibly key size) for the key.
    "privateKeyData": "A String", # The private key data. Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey`
        # responses.
    "privateKeyType": "A String", # The output format for the private key.
        # Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey` responses, not
        # in `GetServiceAccountKey` or `ListServiceAccountKey` responses.
        #
        # Google never exposes system-managed private keys, and never retains
        # user-managed private keys.
    "publicKeyData": "A String", # The public key data. Only provided in `GetServiceAccountKey` responses.
    "validAfterTime": "A String", # The key can be used after this timestamp.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a ServiceAccountKey.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account key in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}/keys/{key}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the project will infer the project from
the account. The `account` value can be the `email` address or the

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, publicKeyType=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the ServiceAccountKey
by key id.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account key in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}/keys/{key}`.

Using `-` as a wildcard for the project will infer the project from
the account. The `account` value can be the `email` address or the
