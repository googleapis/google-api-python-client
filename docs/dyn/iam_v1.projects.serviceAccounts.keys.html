<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a ServiceAccountKey.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the service account. Use one of the following formats: * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` As an alternative, you can use the `-` wildcard character instead of the project ID: * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` When possible, avoid using the `-` wildcard character, because it can cause response messages to contain misleading error codes. For example, if you try to access the service account `projects/-/serviceAccounts/fake@example.com`, which does not exist, the response contains an HTTP `403 Forbidden` error instead of a `404 Not Found` error. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account key create request.
  &quot;keyAlgorithm&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Which type of key and algorithm to use for the key. The default is currently a 2K RSA key. However this may change in the future.
  &quot;privateKeyType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The output format of the private key. The default value is `TYPE_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, which is the Google Credentials File format.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents a service account key. A service account has two sets of key-pairs: user-managed, and system-managed. User-managed key-pairs can be created and deleted by users. Users are responsible for rotating these keys periodically to ensure security of their service accounts. Users retain the private key of these key-pairs, and Google retains ONLY the public key. System-managed keys are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for signing for a maximum of two weeks. The rotation process is probabilistic, and usage of the new key will gradually ramp up and down over the key&#x27;s lifetime. If you cache the public key set for a service account, we recommend that you update the cache every 15 minutes. User-managed keys can be added and removed at any time, so it is important to update the cache frequently. For Google-managed keys, Google will publish a key at least 6 hours before it is first used for signing and will keep publishing it for at least 6 hours after it was last used for signing. Public keys for all service accounts are also published at the OAuth2 Service Account API.
  &quot;contact&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A user provided email address as the point of contact for this service account key. Must be an email address. Limit 64 characters.
  &quot;creator&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The cloud identity that created this service account key. Populated automatically when the key is created and not editable by the user.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A user provided description of this service account key.
  &quot;disableReason&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. optional. If the key is disabled, it may have a DisableReason describing why it was disabled.
  &quot;disabled&quot;: True or False, # The key status.
  &quot;extendedStatus&quot;: [ # Output only. Extended Status provides permanent information about a service account key. For example, if this key was detected as exposed or compromised, that information will remain for the lifetime of the key in the extended_status.
    { # Extended status can store additional metadata. For example, for keys disabled due to their private key data being expoesed we may include a message with more information about the exposure.
      &quot;key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key for this extended status.
      &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The value for the extended status.
    },
  ],
  &quot;keyAlgorithm&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the algorithm (and possibly key size) for the key.
  &quot;keyOrigin&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key origin.
  &quot;keyType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key type.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the service account key in the following format `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}`.
  &quot;privateKeyData&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The private key data. Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey` responses. Make sure to keep the private key data secure because it allows for the assertion of the service account identity. When base64 decoded, the private key data can be used to authenticate with Google API client libraries and with gcloud auth activate-service-account.
  &quot;privateKeyType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The output format for the private key. Only provided in `CreateServiceAccountKey` responses, not in `GetServiceAccountKey` or `ListServiceAccountKey` responses. Google never exposes system-managed private keys, and never retains user-managed private keys.
  &quot;publicKeyData&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The public key data. Only provided in `GetServiceAccountKey` responses.
  &quot;validAfterTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key can be used after this timestamp.
  &quot;validBeforeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key can be used before this timestamp. For system-managed key pairs, this timestamp is the end time for the private key signing operation. The public key could still be used for verification for a few hours after this time.

Users are responsible for rotating these keys periodically to ensure security of their service accounts. Users retain the private key of these key-pairs, and Google retains ONLY the public key. System-managed keys are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for signing for a maximum of two weeks.

If you cache the public key set for a service account, we recommend that you update the cache every 15 minutes. User-managed keys can be added and removed at any time, so it is important to update the cache frequently.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="upload">upload(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Uploads the public key portion of a key pair that you manage, and associates the public key with a ServiceAccount. After you upload the public key, you can use the private key from the key pair as a service account key.

Args:
  name: string, The resource name of the service account key. Use one of the following formats: * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` As an alternative, you can use the `-` wildcard character instead of the project ID: * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{EMAIL_ADDRESS}` * `projects/-/serviceAccounts/{UNIQUE_ID}` When possible, avoid using the `-` wildcard character, because it can cause response messages to contain misleading error codes. For example, if you try to access the service account `projects/-/serviceAccounts/fake@example.com`, which does not exist, the response contains an HTTP `403 Forbidden` error instead of a `404 Not Found` error. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account key upload request.
  &quot;publicKeyData&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The public key to associate with the service account. Must be an RSA public key that is wrapped in an X.509 v3 certificate. Include the first line, `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`, and the last line, `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`.
