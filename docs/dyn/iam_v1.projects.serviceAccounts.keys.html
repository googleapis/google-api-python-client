<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a ServiceAccountKey
and returns it.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the service account in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`.
Using `-` as a wildcard for the `PROJECT_ID` will infer the project from
the account. The `ACCOUNT` value can be the `email` address or the
`unique_id` of the service account. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The service account key create request.
    &quot;keyAlgorithm&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Which type of key and algorithm to use for the key.
        # The default is currently a 2K RSA key.  However this may change in the
        # future.
    &quot;privateKeyType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The output format of the private key. The default value is
        # `TYPE_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, which is the Google Credentials File
        # format.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Represents a service account key.
      #
      # A service account has two sets of key-pairs: user-managed, and
      # system-managed.
      #
      # User-managed key-pairs can be created and deleted by users.  Users are
      # responsible for rotating these keys periodically to ensure security of
      # their service accounts.  Users retain the private key of these key-pairs,
      # and Google retains ONLY the public key.
      #
      # System-managed keys are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for
      # signing for a maximum of two weeks. The rotation process is probabilistic,
      # and usage of the new key will gradually ramp up and down over the key&#x27;s
      # lifetime. We recommend caching the public key set for a service account for
      # no more than 24 hours to ensure you have access to the latest keys.

        # `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}`.
    &quot;validBeforeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key can be used before this timestamp.
        # For system-managed key pairs, this timestamp is the end time for the
        # private key signing operation. The public key could still be used
        # for verification for a few hours after this time.

  <pre>Deletes a ServiceAccountKey.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the service account key in the following format:
`projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}`.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
