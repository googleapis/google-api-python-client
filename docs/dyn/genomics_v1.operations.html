<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#cancel">cancel(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. Clients may use Operations.GetOperation or Operations.ListOperations to check whether the cancellation succeeded or the operation completed despite cancellation.

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service. Authorization requires the following [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permission: * `genomics.operations.get`</p>

  <code><a href="#list">list(name, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>

<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="cancel">cancel(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. Clients may use Operations.GetOperation or Operations.ListOperations to check whether the cancellation succeeded or the operation completed despite cancellation. Authorization requires the following [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permission: * `genomics.operations.cancel`

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for Operations.CancelOperation.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
}</pre>

  <pre>Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service. Authorization requires the following [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permission: * `genomics.operations.get`

Args:

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    <code class="details" id="list">list(name, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. Authorization requires the following [Google IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam) permission: * `genomics.operations.list`

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation&#x27;s parent resource. (required)
  filter: string, A string for filtering Operations. In v2alpha1, the following filter fields are supported: * createTime: The time this job was created * events: The set of event (names) that have occurred while running the pipeline. The : operator can be used to determine if a particular event has occurred. * error: If the pipeline is running, this value is NULL. Once the pipeline finishes, the value is the standard Google error code. * labels.key or labels.&quot;key with space&quot; where key is a label key. * done: If the pipeline is running, this value is false. Once the pipeline finishes, the value is true. In v1 and v1alpha2, the following filter fields are supported: * projectId: Required. Corresponds to OperationMetadata.projectId. * createTime: The time this job was created, in seconds from the [epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). Can use `&gt;=` and/or `&lt;=` operators. * status: Can be `RUNNING`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `CANCELED`. Only one status may be specified. * labels.key where key is a label key. Examples: * `projectId = my-project AND createTime &gt;= 1432140000` * `projectId = my-project AND createTime &gt;= 1432140000 AND createTime &lt;= 1432150000 AND status = RUNNING` * `projectId = my-project AND labels.color = *` * `projectId = my-project AND labels.color = red`
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of results to return. The maximum value is 256.
  pageToken: string, The standard list page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
