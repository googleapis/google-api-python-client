  <pre>Creates a `WorkerPool` to run the builds, and returns the new worker pool. NOTE: As of now, this method returns an `Operation` that is always complete.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource where this worker pool will be created. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Configuration for a `WorkerPool` to run the builds. Workers provide a build environment where Cloud Build runs your builds. Cloud Build owns and maintains a pool of workers for general use. By default, when you submit a build, Cloud Build uses one of the workers from this pool. Builds that run in the default worker pool have access to the public internet. If your build needs access to resources on a private network, create and use a `WorkerPool` to run your builds. Custom `WorkerPool`s give your builds access to any single VPC network that you administer, including any on-prem resources connected to that VPC network. For an overview of custom worker pools, see [Custom workers overview](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/custom-workers-overview).
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time at which the request to create the `WorkerPool` was received.
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time at which the request to delete the `WorkerPool` was received.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource name of the `WorkerPool`, with format `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workerPools/{worker_pool}`. The value of `{worker_pool}` is provided by `worker_pool_id` in `CreateWorkerPool` request and the value of `{location}` is determined by the endpoint accessed.
  &quot;networkConfig&quot;: { # Network describes the network configuration for a `WorkerPool`. # Network configuration for the `WorkerPool`.
    &quot;peeredNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The network definition that the workers are peered to. If this section is left empty, the workers will be peered to `WorkerPool.project_id` on the service producer network. Must be in the format `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`, where `{project}` is a project number, such as `12345`, and `{network}` is the name of a VPC network in the project. See [Understanding network configuration options](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/set-up-custom-worker-pool-environment#understanding_the_network_configuration_options)
  },
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. `WorkerPool` state.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time at which the request to update the `WorkerPool` was received.

    &quot;diskSizeGb&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Size of the disk attached to the worker, in GB. See [Worker pool config file](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/worker-pool-config-file). Specify a value of up to 1000. If `0` is specified, Cloud Build will use a standard disk size.
    &quot;machineType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Machine type of a worker, such as `n1-standard-1`. See [Worker pool config file](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/worker-pool-config-file). If left blank, Cloud Build will use `n1-standard-1`.
    &quot;noExternalIp&quot;: True or False, # If true, workers are created without any public address, which prevents network egress to public IPs.
  },
}

  workerPoolId: string, Required. Immutable. The ID to use for the `WorkerPool`, which will become the final component of the resource name. This value should be 1-63 characters, and valid characters are /a-z-/.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
