  <pre>Creates a `WorkerPool` to run the builds, and returns the new worker pool. NOTE: As of now, this method returns an `Operation` that is always complete.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource where this worker pool will be created. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Configuration for a `WorkerPool` to run the builds. Workers provide a build environment where Cloud Build runs your builds. Cloud Build owns and maintains a pool of workers for general use. By default, when you submit a build, Cloud Build uses one of the workers from this pool. Builds that run in the default worker pool have access to the public internet. If your build needs access to resources on a private network, create and use a `WorkerPool` to run your builds. Custom `WorkerPool`s give your builds access to any single VPC network that you administer, including any on-prem resources connected to that VPC network. For an overview of custom worker pools, see [Custom workers overview](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/custom-workers/custom-workers-overview).

  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
