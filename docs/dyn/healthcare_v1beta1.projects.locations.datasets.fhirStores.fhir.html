  <pre>Translates a code from one value set to another by searching for
appropriate concept maps.

Implements the FHIR standard $translate operation
([DSTU2](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/operation-conceptmap-translate.html),
[STU3](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/operation-conceptmap-translate.html),
[R4](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/operation-conceptmap-translate.html)).

On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation
of a FHIR Parameters resource, which includes the translation result.
Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

Args:
  parent: string, The name for the FHIR store containing the concept map(s) to use for the
translation. (required)
  code: string, The code to translate.
  source: string, The source value set of the concept map to be used. If unset, target is
used to search for concept maps.
  system: string, The system for the code to be translated.
  url: string, The canonical url of the concept map to use. If unset, the source and
target is used to search for concept maps.
  conceptMapVersion: string, The version of the concept map to use. If unset, the most current version
is used.
  target: string, The target value set of the concept map to be used. If unset, source is
used to search for concept maps.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="Observation_lastn">Observation_lastn(parent, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the N most recent `Observation` resources for a subject matching
search criteria specified as query parameters, grouped by
`Observation.code`, sorted from most recent to oldest.

Implements the FHIR extended operation Observation-lastn
([STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/observation-operations.html#lastn),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/observation-operations.html#lastn)).

DSTU2 doesn&#x27;t define the Observation-lastn method, but the server supports
it the same way it supports STU3.

Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as
the search method. The following search parameters must
be provided:

    - `subject` or `patient` to specify a subject for the Observation.
    - `code`, `category` or any of the composite parameters that include
      `code`.

Any other valid Observation search parameters can also be provided. This
operation accepts an additional query parameter `max`, which specifies N,
the maximum number of Observations to return from each group, with a
default of 1.

Searches with over 1000 results are rejected. Results are counted before
grouping and limiting the results with `max`. To stay within the limit,
constrain these searches using Observation search parameters such as
`_lastUpdated` or `date`.

On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation
of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the
operation.
Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the FHIR store to retrieve resources from. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation
of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the
operation.
Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

The resources in scope for the response are:

* The patient resource itself.
* All the resources directly referenced by the patient resource.
* Resources directly referencing the patient resource that meet the
  inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria are based on the membership
  rules in the patient compartment definition
  ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/compartment-patient.html),
  [STU3](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/compartmentdefinition-patient.html),
  [R4](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/compartmentdefinition-patient.html)), which
  details the eligible resource types and referencing search parameters.

Args:
  name: string, Name of the `Patient` resource for which the information is required. (required)
  start: string, The response includes records subsequent to the start date. If no start
date is provided, all records prior to the end date are in scope.
  x_page_token: string, Used to retrieve the next or previous page of results
when using pagination. Value should be set to the value of `page_token` set
in next or previous page links&#x27; URLs. Next and previous page are returned
in the response bundle&#x27;s links field, where `link.relation` is &quot;previous&quot;
or &quot;next&quot;.

Omit `page_token` if no previous request has been made.
  end: string, The response includes records prior to the end date. If no end date is
provided, all records subsequent to the start date are in scope.
  x_count: integer, Maximum number of resources in a page. Defaults to 100.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="conditionalDelete">conditionalDelete(parent, type, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes FHIR resources that match a search query.

Implements the FHIR standard conditional delete interaction
([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.12.1),
[STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.13.1),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#3.1.0.7.1)).
If multiple resources match, all matching resources are deleted.

Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as
the search method.

Note: Unless resource versioning is disabled by setting the
disable_resource_versioning flag
on the FHIR store, the deleted resources are moved to a history
repository that can still be retrieved through vread
and related methods, unless they are removed by the
purge method.

This method requires the`healthcare.fhirStores.searchResources` and
`healthcare.fhirResources.delete` permissions on the parent FHIR store.

Args:
  parent: string, The name of the FHIR store this resource belongs to. (required)
  type: string, The FHIR resource type to delete, such as Patient or Observation. For a
complete list, see the FHIR Resource Index
([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/resourcelist.html),
[STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/resourcelist.html),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/resourcelist.html)). (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:

      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="conditionalPatch">conditionalPatch(parent, type, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>If a resource is found based on the search criteria specified in the query

specified in a [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) document.

Implements the FHIR standard conditional patch interaction
([STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#patch),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#patch)).

DSTU2 doesn&#x27;t define a conditional patch method, but the server supports it
in the same way it supports STU3.

Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as
the search method.

If the search criteria identify more than one match, the request
returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error.

The request body must contain a JSON Patch document, and the request
headers must contain `Content-Type: application/json-patch+json`.

On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation
of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID.
Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

This method requires the`healthcare.fhirStores.searchResources` permission
on the parent FHIR store and the `healthcare.fhirResources.patch`
permission on the requested FHIR store resource.

Args:
  parent: string, The name of the FHIR store this resource belongs to. (required)

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a FHIR resource.

Implements the FHIR standard delete interaction
([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#delete),
[STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#delete),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#delete)).

Note: Unless resource versioning is disabled by setting the
disable_resource_versioning flag
on the FHIR store, the deleted resources are moved to a history
repository that can still be retrieved through vread
and related methods, unless they are removed by the
purge method.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="executeBundle">executeBundle(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Executes all the requests in the given Bundle.

Implements the FHIR standard batch/transaction interaction
([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#transaction),
[STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#transaction),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#transaction)).

Supports all interactions within a bundle, except search. This method
accepts Bundles of type `batch` and `transaction`, processing them
according to the batch processing rules
([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.16.1),
[STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.1),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#brules))
and transaction processing rules
([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#2.1.0.16.2),
[STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.2),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#trules)).

The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR `Bundle` resource, and
the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`.

For a batch bundle or a successful transaction the response body
contains a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type
`batch-response` or `transaction-response` containing one entry for each
entry in the request, with the outcome of processing the entry. In the
case of an error for a transaction bundle, the response body contains
a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the
error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR
store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead.

This method requires permission for executing the requests in the bundle.
The `executeBundle` permission grants permission to execute the request in
the bundle but you must grant sufficient permissions to execute the
individual requests in the bundle. For example, if the bundle contains a
`create` request, you must have permission to execute the `create` request.

Logging is available for the `executeBundle` permission.

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the FHIR store in which this bundle will be executed. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

sorted from most recent to oldest versions.
Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the resource to retrieve. (required)
  x_since: string, Only include resource versions that were created at or after the given
instant in time. The instant in time uses the format
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss+zz:zz (for example 2015-02-07T13:28:17.239+02:00 or
2017-01-01T00:00:00Z). The time must be specified to the second and
include a time zone.
  x_at: string, Only include resource versions that were current at some point during the
time period specified in the date time value. The date parameter format is
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm]

Clients may specify any of the following:

*  An entire year: `_at=2019`

  x_page_token: string, Used to retrieve the first, previous, next, or last page of resource
versions when using pagination. Value should be set to the value of
`_page_token` set in next or previous page links&#x27; URLs. Next and previous
page are returned in the response bundle&#x27;s links field, where
`link.relation` is &quot;previous&quot; or &quot;next&quot;.

Omit `_page_token` if no previous request has been made.
  x_count: integer, The maximum number of search results on a page. Defaults to 1000.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="search">search(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Searches for resources in the given FHIR store according to criteria
specified as query parameters.

Implements the FHIR standard search interaction
([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#search),
[STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#search),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#search))
using the search semantics described in the FHIR Search specification
([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/search.html),
[STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/search.html)).

Supports three methods of search defined by the specification:

*  `GET [base]?[parameters]` to search across all resources.
*  `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search resources of a specified
type.
*  `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having
the same semantics as the `GET` method.

The `GET` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST` method
does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search parameters.

On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation
of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the
search.
Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

The server&#x27;s capability statement, retrieved through
capabilities, indicates what search parameters
are supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters
defined by the specification can be found in the FHIR Search Parameter
Registry
([STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-registry.html),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/searchparameter-registry.html)).
FHIR search parameters for DSTU2 can be found on each resource&#x27;s definition
page.

Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`,
`:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`.

Supported search result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`,
`_revinclude`, `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`.

The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can
be overridden by the `_count` parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. If
there are additional results, the returned `Bundle` contains
pagination links.

Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than
50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated
search index in those cases.

Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight
delay between the time a resource is created or changes and when the change
is reflected in search results.

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the FHIR store to retrieve resources from. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to search the resources in the specified FHIR store.
    &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The FHIR resource type to search, such as Patient or Observation. For a
        # complete list, see the FHIR Resource Index
        # ([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/resourcelist.html),
        # [STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/resourcelist.html),
        # [R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/resourcelist.html)).
  }

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the entire contents of a resource.

Implements the FHIR standard update interaction
([DSTU2](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/DSTU2/http.html#update),
[STU3](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#update),
[R4](https://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/R4/http.html#update)).

If the specified resource does
not exist and the FHIR store has
enable_update_create set, creates the
resource with the client-specified ID.

The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request
headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. The resource
must contain an `id` element having an identical value to the ID in the
REST path of the request.

On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation
of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID.
Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the resource to update. (required)
