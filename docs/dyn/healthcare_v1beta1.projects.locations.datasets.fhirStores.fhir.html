<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="Observation-lastn">Observation-lastn(parent, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the N most recent `Observation` resources for a subject matching
search criteria specified as query parameters, grouped by
`Observation.code`, sorted from most recent to oldest.

Implements the FHIR extended operation
[Observation-lastn](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/observation-operations.html#lastn).

Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as
the search method. This operation accepts an additional
query parameter `max`, which specifies N, the maximum number of
Observations to return from each group, with a default of 1.

On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation
of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the
operation.
Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the FHIR store to retrieve resources from. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

  <pre>Deletes FHIR resources that match a search query.

Implements the FHIR standard [conditional delete
interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.13.1).
If multiple resources match, all of them will be deleted.

Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as
the search method.

Note: Unless resource versioning is disabled by setting the

on the FHIR store, the deleted resources will be moved to a history
repository that can still be retrieved through vread
and related methods, unless they are removed by the
purge method.

Args:

specified in a [JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) document.

Implements the FHIR standard [conditional patch
interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#patch).

Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as
the search method.

If the search criteria identify more than one match, the request will
return a `412 Precondition Failed` error.

The request body must contain a JSON Patch document, and the request
headers must contain `Content-Type: application/json-patch+json`.

On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation
of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID.
Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

    <code class="details" id="conditionalUpdate">conditionalUpdate(parent, type, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>If a resource is found based on the search criteria specified in the query
parameters, updates the entire contents of that resource.

Implements the FHIR standard [conditional update
interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#cond-update).

Search terms are provided as query parameters following the same pattern as
the search method.

If the search criteria identify more than one match, the request will
return a `412 Precondition Failed` error.
If the search criteria identify zero matches, and the supplied resource
body contains an `id`, and the FHIR store has
enable_update_create set, creates the
resource with the client-specified ID. If the search criteria identify zero
matches, and the supplied resource body does not contain an `id`, the
resource will be created with a server-assigned ID as per the
create method.

The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request
headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`.

On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation
of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID.
Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

Args:
  parent: string, The name of the FHIR store this resource belongs to. (required)
  type: string, The FHIR resource type to update, such as Patient or Observation. For a
complete list, see the [FHIR Resource
Index](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/resourcelist.html).

  <pre>Creates a FHIR resource.

Implements the FHIR standard [create
interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#create),
which creates a new resource with a server-assigned resource ID.

Also supports the FHIR standard [conditional create
interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#ccreate),
specified by supplying an `If-None-Exist` header containing a FHIR search
query. If no resources match this search query, the server processes the
create operation as normal.

The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request
headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`.

On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation
of the resource as it was created on the server, including the
server-assigned resource ID and version ID.
Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the

  <pre>Executes all the requests in the given Bundle.

Implements the FHIR standard [batch/transaction
interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#transaction).

Supports all interactions within a bundle, except search. This method
accepts Bundles of type `batch` and `transaction`, processing them
according to the [batch processing
rules](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.1)
and [transaction processing
rules](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#2.21.0.17.2).

The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR `Bundle` resource, and
the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`.

For a batch bundle or a successful transaction the response body will
contain a JSON-encoded representation of a `Bundle` resource of type
`batch-response` or `transaction-response` containing one entry for each
entry in the request, with the outcome of processing the entry. In the
case of an error for a transaction bundle, the response body will contain
a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the
error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR
store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead.

  <pre>Lists all the versions of a resource (including the current version and
deleted versions) from the FHIR store.

Implements the per-resource form of the FHIR standard [history
interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#history).

On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation
of a `Bundle` resource of type `history`, containing the version history
sorted from most recent to oldest versions.
Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the resource to retrieve. (required)
  count: integer, The maximum number of search results on a page. Defaults to 1000.
  since: string, Only include resource versions that were created at or after the given
instant in time. The instant in time uses the format
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss+zz:zz (for example 2015-02-07T13:28:17.239+02:00 or
2017-01-01T00:00:00Z). The time must be specified to the second and
include a time zone.
  page: string, Used to retrieve the first, previous, next, or last page of resource
versions when using pagination. Value should be set to the value of the
`link.url` field returned in the response to the previous request, where
`link.relation` is "first", "previous", "next" or "last".

Omit `page` if no previous request has been made.
  at: string, Only include resource versions that were current at some point during the
time period specified in the date time value. The date parameter format is
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm]

Clients may specify any of the following:

*  An entire year: `_at=2019`
*  An entire month: `_at=2019-01`
*  A specific day: `_at=2019-01-20`
*  A specific second: `_at=2018-12-31T23:59:58Z`

  <pre>Searches for resources in the given FHIR store according to criteria
specified as query parameters.

Implements the FHIR standard [search
interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#search)
using the search semantics described in the [FHIR Search
specification](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/search.html).

Supports three methods of search defined by the specification:

*  `GET [base]?[parameters]` to search across all resources.
*  `GET [base]/[type]?[parameters]` to search resources of a specified
type.
*  `POST [base]/[type]/_search?[parameters]` as an alternate form having
the same semantics as the `GET` method.

The `GET` methods do not support compartment searches. The `POST` method
does not support `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` search parameters.

On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation
of a `Bundle` resource of type `searchset`, containing the results of the
search.
Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

The server's capability statement, retrieved through
capabilities, indicates what search parameters
are supported on each FHIR resource. A list of all search parameters
defined by the specification can be found in the [FHIR Search Parameter
Registry](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/searchparameter-registry.html).

Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`,
`:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`.

Args:
  parent: string, Name of the FHIR store to retrieve resources from. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="vread">vread(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the contents of a version (current or historical) of a FHIR resource
by version ID.

Implements the FHIR standard [vread
interaction](http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/STU3/http.html#vread).

On success, the response body will contain a JSON-encoded representation
of the resource.
Errors generated by the FHIR store will contain a JSON-encoded
`OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the
request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic
GCP error might be returned instead.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the resource version to retrieve. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
        # payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
        # an HTML page.
        #
        #
        # This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
        # the request as well as the response.
        #
        # It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
        # wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        # request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.
        #
        # Example:
        #
        #     message GetResourceRequest {
        #       // A unique request id.
        #       string request_id = 1;
