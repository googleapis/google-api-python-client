  <code><a href="#get">get(courseId, courseWorkId, id, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Returns a student submission. * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the requested course, course work, or student submission or for access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed. * `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course, course work, or student submission does not exist.</p>

<p class="firstline">Returns a list of student submissions that the requester is permitted to view, factoring in the OAuth scopes of the request. `-` may be specified as the `course_work_id` to include student submissions for multiple course work items. Course students may only view their own work. Course teachers and domain administrators may view all student submissions. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the requested course or course work, or for access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed. * `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course does not exist.</p>

<p class="firstline">Modifies attachments of student submission. Attachments may only be added to student submissions belonging to course work objects with a `workType` of `ASSIGNMENT`. This request must be made by the Developer Console project of the [OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to create the corresponding course work item. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the requested course or course work, if the user is not permitted to modify attachments on the requested student submission, or for access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed. * `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course, course work, or student submission does not exist.</p>

This request must be made by the Developer Console project of the [OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to create the corresponding course work item. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting developer project did not create the corresponding course work, if the user is not permitted to make the requested modification to the student submission, or for access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed. * `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course, course work, or student submission does not exist.</p>

This request must be made by the Developer Console project of the [OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to create the corresponding course work item.

<p class="firstline">Returns a student submission. Returning a student submission transfers ownership of attached Drive files to the student and may also update the submission state. Unlike the Classroom application, returning a student submission does not set assignedGrade to the draftGrade value.

This request must be made by the Developer Console project of the [OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to create the corresponding course work item. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the requested course or course work, return the requested student submission, or for access errors. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed. * `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course, course work, or student submission does not exist.</p>

Only the student that owns the requested student submission may call this method, and only for a student submission that has been turned in. This request must be made by the Developer Console project of the [OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to create the corresponding course work item. This method returns the following error codes: * `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the requested course or course work, unsubmit the requested student submission, or for access errors. * `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the student submission has not been turned in. * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed. * `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course, course work, or student submission does not exist.

Args:
  courseId: string, Identifier of the course. This identifier can be either the Classroom-assigned identifier or an alias. (required)
  courseWorkId: string, Identifier of the course work. (required)
  id: string, Identifier of the student submission. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to reclaim a student submission.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
}</pre>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="return_">return_(courseId, courseWorkId, id, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns a student submission. Returning a student submission transfers ownership of attached Drive files to the student and may also update the submission state. Unlike the Classroom application, returning a student submission does not set assignedGrade to the draftGrade value.
