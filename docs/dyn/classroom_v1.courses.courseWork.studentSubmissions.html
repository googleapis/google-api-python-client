<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="reclaim">reclaim(courseId, courseWorkId, id, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Reclaims a student submission on behalf of the student that owns it.

Reclaiming a student submission transfers ownership of attached Drive
files to the student and update the submission state.

Only the student that owns the requested student submission may call this
method, and only for a student submission that has been turned in.

This request must be made by the Developer Console project of the
[OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to
create the corresponding course work item.

This method returns the following error codes:

* `PERMISSION_DENIED` if the requesting user is not permitted to access the
requested course or course work, unsubmit the requested student submission,
or for access errors.
* `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the student submission has not been turned in.
* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed.
* `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course, course work, or student submission
does not exist.

Args:
  courseId: string, Identifier of the course.
This identifier can be either the Classroom-assigned identifier or an
alias. (required)
  courseWorkId: string, Identifier of the course work. (required)
  id: string, Identifier of the student submission. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to reclaim a student submission.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="return_">return_(courseId, courseWorkId, id, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns a student submission.

Returning a student submission transfers ownership of attached Drive
files to the student and may also update the submission state.
Unlike the Classroom application, returning a student submission does not
set assignedGrade to the draftGrade value.

Only a teacher of the course that contains the requested student submission
may call this method.

This request must be made by the Developer Console project of the
[OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) used to

requested course or course work, return the requested student submission,
or for access errors.
* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if the request is malformed.
* `NOT_FOUND` if the requested course, course work, or student submission
does not exist.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="turnIn">turnIn(courseId, courseWorkId, id, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>

files to the teacher and may also update the submission state.

This may only be called by the student that owns the specified student
submission.
