The format of the revision ID may change over time, so it should be treated opaquely. A returned revision ID is only guaranteed to be valid for 24 hours after it has been returned and cannot be shared across users. If the revision ID is unchanged between calls, then the form has not changed. Conversely, a changed ID (for the same form and user) usually means the form has been updated; however, a changed ID can also be due to internal factors such as ID format changes.

If changes have occurred after this revision, the changes in this update request are transformed against those changes. This results in a new revision of the form that incorporates both the changes in the request and the intervening changes, with the server resolving conflicting changes. The target revision ID may only be used to write to recent versions of a form. If the target revision is too far behind the latest revision, the request is not processed and returns a 400 (Bad Request Error). The request may be retried after reading the latest version of the form. In most cases a target revision ID remains valid for several minutes after it is read, but for frequently-edited forms this window may be shorter.
