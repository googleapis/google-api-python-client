  <pre>Create a new form using the title given in the provided form message in the request. *Important:* Only the form.info.title and form.info.document_title fields are copied to the new form. All other fields including the form description, items and settings are disallowed. To create a new form and add items, you must first call forms.create to create an empty form with a title and (optional) document title, and then call forms.update to add the items.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Google Forms document. A form is created in Drive, and deleting a form or changing its access protections is done via the [Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-sdk).

If `Info.title` is empty, `document_title` may appear in its place in the Google Forms UI and be visible to responders. `document_title` can be set on create, but cannot be modified by a batchUpdate request. Please use the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files/update) if you need to programmatically update `document_title`.
