<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="batchCreate">batchCreate(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Begins executing a batch create jobs operation.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the tenant under which the job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to create a batch of jobs.
  &quot;jobs&quot;: [ # Required. The jobs to be created. A maximum of 200 jobs can be created in a batch.
    { # A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a &quot;job listing&quot; or &quot;job requisition&quot;). A job belongs to a Company, which is the hiring entity responsible for the job.
      &quot;addresses&quot;: [ # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#x27;ReqA&#x27; becomes &#x27;ReqA-1&#x27;, &#x27;ReqA-2&#x27;, and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses &quot;1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; and &quot;London, UK&quot; may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.) If a job needs to have multiple addresses, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with same LocationTypes. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.

This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.

In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.

        ],
      },
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.
      &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;incentives&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.

      &quot;jobLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The experience level associated with the job, such as &quot;Entry Level&quot;.
      &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
      &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
      &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
      &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
      &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
      &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
      &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
      &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Options for job processing. # Options for job processing.

Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation isn&#x27;t disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.

      &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
      &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
      &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, is assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn&#x27;t allowed to be created if there is another job with the same company, language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
      &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
              &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.

If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.

      &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
      &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.

If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#x27;ReqA&#x27; becomes &#x27;ReqA-1&#x27;, &#x27;ReqA-2&#x27;, and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience.

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.

The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
  &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
  &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
  &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.

If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#x27;ReqA&#x27; becomes &#x27;ReqA-1&#x27;, &#x27;ReqA-2&#x27;, and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses &quot;1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; and &quot;London, UK&quot; may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;).

This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.

The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
  &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
  &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
  &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available.

    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the specified job. Typically, the job becomes unsearchable within 10 seconds, but it may take up to 5 minutes.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the job to be deleted. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the specified job, whose status is OPEN or recently EXPIRED within the last 90 days.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the job to retrieve. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

  &quot;addresses&quot;: [ # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#x27;ReqA&#x27; becomes &#x27;ReqA-1&#x27;, &#x27;ReqA-2&#x27;, and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses &quot;1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; and &quot;London, UK&quot; may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)

Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;).

This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations.

  &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
  &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
  &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
  &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
  &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Options for job processing. # Options for job processing.
    &quot;disableStreetAddressResolution&quot;: True or False, # If set to `true`, the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job.
    &quot;htmlSanitization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation isn&#x27;t disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.
  },
  &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
  &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, is assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn&#x27;t allowed to be created if there is another job with the same company, language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
  &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The title of the job, such as &quot;Software Engineer&quot; The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.
  &quot;visibility&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Deprecated. The job is only visible to the owner. The visibility of the job. Defaults to Visibility.ACCOUNT_ONLY if not specified.

Sample Query: * companyName = &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz&quot; * companyName = &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz&quot; AND requisitionId = &quot;req-1&quot; * companyName = &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/companies/baz&quot; AND status = &quot;EXPIRED&quot; * requisitionId = &quot;req-1&quot; * requisitionId = &quot;req-1&quot; AND status = &quot;EXPIRED&quot;
  jobView: string, The desired job attributes returned for jobs in the search response. Defaults to JobView.JOB_VIEW_FULL if no value is specified.
    Allowed values
      JOB_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - Default value.
      JOB_VIEW_ID_ONLY - A ID only view of job, with following attributes: Job.name, Job.requisition_id, Job.language_code.
      JOB_VIEW_MINIMAL - A minimal view of the job, with the following attributes: Job.name, Job.requisition_id, Job.title, Job.company, Job.DerivedInfo.locations, Job.language_code.

  pageToken: string, The starting point of a query result.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

  An object of the form:

    { # List jobs response.
  &quot;jobs&quot;: [ # The Jobs for a given company. The maximum number of items returned is based on the limit field provided in the request.

      &quot;addresses&quot;: [ # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#x27;ReqA&#x27; becomes &#x27;ReqA-1&#x27;, &#x27;ReqA-2&#x27;, and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses &quot;1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; and &quot;London, UK&quot; may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)

In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
              &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
              &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.

              &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
              &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.

      &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
      &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
      &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
      &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
      &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.

If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.

The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
      &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.

This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn&#x27;t allowed to be created if there is another job with the same company, language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.

  <pre>Updates specified job. Typically, updated contents become visible in search results within 10 seconds, but it may take up to 5 minutes.

Args:
  name: string, Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Job resource represents a job posting (also referred to as a &quot;job listing&quot; or &quot;job requisition&quot;). A job belongs to a Company, which is the hiring entity responsible for the job.
  &quot;addresses&quot;: [ # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#x27;ReqA&#x27; becomes &#x27;ReqA-1&#x27;, &#x27;ReqA-2&#x27;, and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses &quot;1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; and &quot;London, UK&quot; may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)

        &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.
          &quot;addressLines&quot;: [ # Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.

          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.

  &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
  &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
  &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
  &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.

The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
  &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, is assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn&#x27;t allowed to be created if there is another job with the same company, language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
  &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.

  &quot;addresses&quot;: [ # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. Location(s) where the employer is looking to hire for this job posting. Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#x27;ReqA&#x27; becomes &#x27;ReqA-1&#x27;, &#x27;ReqA-2&#x27;, and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses &quot;1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; and &quot;London, UK&quot; may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.) If a job needs to have multiple addresses, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with same LocationTypes. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.

        &quot;postalAddress&quot;: { # Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses. Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premises, P.O. Box, or other delivery location.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;administrativeArea&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
          &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.

          &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).

Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.

  &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
  &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
  &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
  &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
  &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
  &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
  &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Options for job processing. # Options for job processing.
    &quot;disableStreetAddressResolution&quot;: True or False, # If set to `true`, the service does not attempt to resolve a more precise address for the job.

Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation isn&#x27;t disabled.

  &quot;promotionValue&quot;: 42, # A promotion value of the job, as determined by the client. The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
  &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, is assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn&#x27;t allowed to be created if there is another job with the same company, language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
  &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The title of the job, such as &quot;Software Engineer&quot; The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.

  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest. This call constrains the visibility of jobs present in the database, and only returns jobs that the caller has permission to search against.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the tenant to search within. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

  &quot;customRankingInfo&quot;: { # Custom ranking information for SearchJobsRequest. # Controls over how job documents get ranked on top of existing relevance score (determined by API algorithm).
    &quot;importanceLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Controls over how important the score of CustomRankingInfo.ranking_expression gets applied to job&#x27;s final ranking position. An error is thrown if not specified.
    &quot;rankingExpression&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Controls over how job documents get ranked on top of existing relevance score (determined by API algorithm). A combination of the ranking expression and relevance score is used to determine job&#x27;s final ranking position. The syntax for this expression is a subset of Google SQL syntax. Supported operators are: +, -, *, /, where the left and right side of the operator is either a numeric Job.custom_attributes key, integer/double value or an expression that can be evaluated to a number. Parenthesis are supported to adjust calculation precedence. The expression must be &lt; 200 characters in length. The expression is considered invalid for a job if the expression references custom attributes that are not populated on the job or if the expression results in a divide by zero. If an expression is invalid for a job, that job is demoted to the end of the results. Sample ranking expression (year + 25) * 0.25 - (freshness / 0.5)
  },
  &quot;disableKeywordMatch&quot;: True or False, # This field is deprecated. Please use SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode going forward. To migrate, disable_keyword_match set to false maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_ALL, and disable_keyword_match set to true maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_DISABLED. If SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode is set, this field is ignored. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.addresses, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, for the query &quot;program manager,&quot; a result is returned even if the job posting has the title &quot;software developer,&quot; which doesn&#x27;t fall into &quot;program manager&quot; ontology, but does have &quot;program manager&quot; appearing in its description. For queries like &quot;cloud&quot; that don&#x27;t contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with &quot;cloud&quot; keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag&#x27;s value. Use Company.keyword_searchable_job_custom_attributes if company-specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values are needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false.
  &quot;diversificationLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified.
  &quot;enableBroadening&quot;: True or False, # Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false.
  &quot;histogramQueries&quot;: [ # An expression specifies a histogram request against matching jobs. Expression syntax is an aggregation function call with histogram facets and other options.

In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478 # Postal address of the location that includes human readable information, such as postal delivery and payments addresses.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. &quot;Austin, TX&quot;), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be &quot;envelope order&quot; for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. &quot;ja&quot; for large-to-small ordering and &quot;ja-Latn&quot; or &quot;en&quot; for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses &quot;1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; and &quot;London, UK&quot; may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.)

Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and not &quot;Catalonia&quot;). Many countries don&#x27;t use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
                &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address&#x27; country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: &quot;zh-Hant&quot;, &quot;ja&quot;, &quot;ja-Latn&quot;, &quot;en&quot;.
                &quot;locality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
                &quot;organization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
                &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
                &quot;recipients&quot;: [ # Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain &quot;care of&quot; information.

                &quot;regionCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: &quot;CH&quot; for Switzerland.

                &quot;sortingCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like &quot;CEDEX&quot;, optionally followed by a number (e.g. &quot;CEDEX 7&quot;), or just a number alone, representing the &quot;sector code&quot; (Jamaica), &quot;delivery area indicator&quot; (Malawi) or &quot;post office indicator&quot; (e.g. Côte d&#x27;Ivoire).
                &quot;sublocality&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.

For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 6.17 miles.
            },

Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.
        &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],

        ],
        &quot;jobEndTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;jobLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The experience level associated with the job, such as &quot;Entry Level&quot;.
        &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
        &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
        &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
        &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
        &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.

Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation isn&#x27;t disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.

The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
        &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.

This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn&#x27;t allowed to be created if there is another job with the same company, language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="searchForAlert">searchForAlert(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Searches for jobs using the provided SearchJobsRequest. This API call is intended for the use case of targeting passive job seekers (for example, job seekers who have signed up to receive email alerts about potential job opportunities), it has different algorithmic adjustments that are designed to specifically target passive job seekers. This call constrains the visibility of jobs present in the database, and only returns jobs the caller has permission to search against.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the tenant to search within. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar&quot;. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The Request body of the `SearchJobs` call.
  &quot;customRankingInfo&quot;: { # Custom ranking information for SearchJobsRequest. # Controls over how job documents get ranked on top of existing relevance score (determined by API algorithm).
    &quot;importanceLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Controls over how important the score of CustomRankingInfo.ranking_expression gets applied to job&#x27;s final ranking position. An error is thrown if not specified.
    &quot;rankingExpression&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Controls over how job documents get ranked on top of existing relevance score (determined by API algorithm). A combination of the ranking expression and relevance score is used to determine job&#x27;s final ranking position. The syntax for this expression is a subset of Google SQL syntax. Supported operators are: +, -, *, /, where the left and right side of the operator is either a numeric Job.custom_attributes key, integer/double value or an expression that can be evaluated to a number. Parenthesis are supported to adjust calculation precedence. The expression must be &lt; 200 characters in length. The expression is considered invalid for a job if the expression references custom attributes that are not populated on the job or if the expression results in a divide by zero. If an expression is invalid for a job, that job is demoted to the end of the results. Sample ranking expression (year + 25) * 0.25 - (freshness / 0.5)
  },
  &quot;disableKeywordMatch&quot;: True or False, # This field is deprecated. Please use SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode going forward. To migrate, disable_keyword_match set to false maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_ALL, and disable_keyword_match set to true maps to KeywordMatchMode.KEYWORD_MATCH_DISABLED. If SearchJobsRequest.keyword_match_mode is set, this field is ignored. Controls whether to disable exact keyword match on Job.title, Job.description, Job.company_display_name, Job.addresses, Job.qualifications. When disable keyword match is turned off, a keyword match returns jobs that do not match given category filters when there are matching keywords. For example, for the query &quot;program manager,&quot; a result is returned even if the job posting has the title &quot;software developer,&quot; which doesn&#x27;t fall into &quot;program manager&quot; ontology, but does have &quot;program manager&quot; appearing in its description. For queries like &quot;cloud&quot; that don&#x27;t contain title or location specific ontology, jobs with &quot;cloud&quot; keyword matches are returned regardless of this flag&#x27;s value. Use Company.keyword_searchable_job_custom_attributes if company-specific globally matched custom field/attribute string values are needed. Enabling keyword match improves recall of subsequent search requests. Defaults to false.
  &quot;diversificationLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Controls whether highly similar jobs are returned next to each other in the search results. Jobs are identified as highly similar based on their titles, job categories, and locations. Highly similar results are clustered so that only one representative job of the cluster is displayed to the job seeker higher up in the results, with the other jobs being displayed lower down in the results. Defaults to DiversificationLevel.SIMPLE if no value is specified.
  &quot;enableBroadening&quot;: True or False, # Controls whether to broaden the search when it produces sparse results. Broadened queries append results to the end of the matching results list. Defaults to false.
  &quot;histogramQueries&quot;: [ # An expression specifies a histogram request against matching jobs. Expression syntax is an aggregation function call with histogram facets and other options. Available aggregation function calls are: * `count(string_histogram_facet)`: Count the number of matching entities, for each distinct attribute value. * `count(numeric_histogram_facet, list of buckets)`: Count the number of matching entities within each bucket. A maximum of 200 histogram buckets are supported. Data types: * Histogram facet: facet names with format `a-zA-Z+`. * String: string like &quot;any string with backslash escape for quote(\&quot;).&quot; * Number: whole number and floating point number like 10, -1 and -0.01. * List: list of elements with comma(,) separator surrounded by square brackets, for example, [1, 2, 3] and [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;]. Built-in constants: * MIN (minimum number similar to java Double.MIN_VALUE) * MAX (maximum number similar to java Double.MAX_VALUE) Built-in functions: * bucket(start, end[, label]): bucket built-in function creates a bucket with range of start, end). Note that the end is exclusive, for example, bucket(1, MAX, &quot;positive number&quot;) or bucket(1, 10). Job histogram facets: * company_display_name: histogram by [Job.company_display_name. * employment_type: histogram by Job.employment_types, for example, &quot;FULL_TIME&quot;, &quot;PART_TIME&quot;. * company_size (DEPRECATED): histogram by CompanySize, for example, &quot;SMALL&quot;, &quot;MEDIUM&quot;, &quot;BIG&quot;. * publish_time_in_day: histogram by the Job.posting_publish_time in days.

Must specify list of numeric buckets to group results by. * string_custom_attribute: histogram by string Job.custom_attributes. Values can be accessed via square bracket notations like string_custom_attribute[&quot;key1&quot;]. * numeric_custom_attribute: histogram by numeric Job.custom_attributes. Values can be accessed via square bracket notations like numeric_custom_attribute[&quot;key1&quot;]. Must specify list of numeric buckets to group results by. Example expressions: * `count(admin1)` * `count(base_compensation, [bucket(1000, 10000), bucket(10000, 100000), bucket(100000, MAX)])` * `count(string_custom_attribute[&quot;some-string-custom-attribute&quot;])` * `count(numeric_custom_attribute[&quot;some-numeric-custom-attribute&quot;], [bucket(MIN, 0, &quot;negative&quot;), bucket(0, MAX, &quot;non-negative&quot;)])`

Specifying the full street address(es) of the hiring location enables better API results, especially job searches by commute time. At most 50 locations are allowed for best search performance. If a job has more locations, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with unique requisition_ids (e.g. &#x27;ReqA&#x27; becomes &#x27;ReqA-1&#x27;, &#x27;ReqA-2&#x27;, and so on.) as multiple jobs with the same company, language_code and requisition_id are not allowed. If the original requisition_id must be preserved, a custom field should be used for storage. It is also suggested to group the locations that close to each other in the same job for better search experience. Jobs with multiple addresses must have their addresses with the same LocationType to allow location filtering to work properly. (For example, a Job with addresses &quot;1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; and &quot;London, UK&quot; may not have location filters applied correctly at search time since the first is a LocationType.STREET_ADDRESS and the second is a LocationType.LOCALITY.) If a job needs to have multiple addresses, it is suggested to split it into multiple jobs with same LocationTypes. The maximum number of allowed characters is 500.

Advice on address input / editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.

This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

              &quot;radiusMiles&quot;: 3.14, # Radius in miles of the job location.

For example, currently, &quot;Mountain View, CA, USA&quot; has a radius of 6.17 miles.
            },
          ],
        },
        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The description of the job, which typically includes a multi-paragraph description of the company and related information. Separate fields are provided on the job object for responsibilities, qualifications, and other job characteristics. Use of these separate job fields is recommended. This field accepts and sanitizes HTML input, and also accepts bold, italic, ordered list, and unordered list markup tags. The maximum number of allowed characters is 100,000.
        &quot;employmentTypes&quot;: [ # The employment type(s) of a job, for example, full time or part time.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;incentives&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of bonus, commission, and other compensation incentives associated with the job not including salary or pay. The maximum number of allowed characters is 10,000.
        &quot;jobBenefits&quot;: [ # The benefits included with the job.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;jobEndTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The end timestamp of the job. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;jobLevel&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The experience level associated with the job, such as &quot;Entry Level&quot;.
        &quot;jobStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The start timestamp of the job in UTC time zone. Typically this field is used for contracting engagements. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The language of the posting. This field is distinct from any requirements for fluency that are associated with the job. Language codes must be in BCP-47 format, such as &quot;en-US&quot; or &quot;sr-Latn&quot;. For more information, see [Tags for Identifying Languages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47){: class=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; }. If this field is unspecified and Job.description is present, detected language code based on Job.description is assigned, otherwise defaults to &#x27;en_US&#x27;.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required during job update. The resource name for the job. This is generated by the service when a job is created. The format is &quot;projects/{project_id}/tenants/{tenant_id}/jobs/{job_id}&quot;. For example, &quot;projects/foo/tenants/bar/jobs/baz&quot;. Use of this field in job queries and API calls is preferred over the use of requisition_id since this value is unique.
        &quot;postingCreateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was created.
        &quot;postingExpireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly recommended for the best service experience. The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The expired job can&#x27;t be listed by the ListJobs API, but it can be retrieved with the GetJob API or updated with the UpdateJob API or deleted with the DeleteJob API. An expired job can be updated and opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired job fails if there is another existing open job with same company, language_code and requisition_id. The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum number of open jobs over previous 7 days. If this threshold is exceeded, expired jobs are cleaned out in order of earliest expire time. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned out. Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided. If the timestamp is before the instant request is made, the job is treated as expired immediately on creation. This kind of job can not be updated. And when creating a job with past timestamp, the posting_publish_time must be set before posting_expire_time. The purpose of this feature is to allow other objects, such as Application, to refer a job that didn&#x27;t exist in the system prior to becoming expired. If you want to modify a job that was expired on creation, delete it and create a new one. If this value isn&#x27;t provided at the time of job creation or is invalid, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s creation time. For example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC. If this value isn&#x27;t provided on job update, it depends on the field masks set by UpdateJobRequest.update_mask. If the field masks include job_end_time, or the masks are empty meaning that every field is updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job&#x27;s last update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn&#x27;t updated.
        &quot;postingPublishTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are ignored.
        &quot;postingRegion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The job PostingRegion (for example, state, country) throughout which the job is available. If this field is set, a LocationFilter in a search query within the job region finds this job posting if an exact location match isn&#x27;t specified. If this field is set to PostingRegion.NATION or PostingRegion.ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA, setting job Job.addresses to the same location level as this field is strongly recommended.
        &quot;postingUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when this job posting was last updated.
        &quot;processingOptions&quot;: { # Options for job processing. # Options for job processing.

          &quot;htmlSanitization&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Option for job HTML content sanitization. Applied fields are: * description * applicationInfo.instruction * incentives * qualifications * responsibilities HTML tags in these fields may be stripped if sanitiazation isn&#x27;t disabled. Defaults to HtmlSanitization.SIMPLE_FORMATTING_ONLY.

The value determines the sort order of the jobs returned when searching for jobs using the featured jobs search call, with higher promotional values being returned first and ties being resolved by relevance sort. Only the jobs with a promotionValue &gt;0 are returned in a FEATURED_JOB_SEARCH. Default value is 0, and negative values are treated as 0.
        &quot;qualifications&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of the qualifications required to perform the job. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.

        &quot;requisitionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The requisition ID, also referred to as the posting ID, is assigned by the client to identify a job. This field is intended to be used by clients for client identification and tracking of postings. A job isn&#x27;t allowed to be created if there is another job with the same company, language_code and requisition_id. The maximum number of allowed characters is 255.
        &quot;responsibilities&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description of job responsibilities. The use of this field is recommended as an alternative to using the more general description field.

      &quot;searchTextSnippet&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Contains snippets of text from the Job.description and similar fields that most closely match a search query&#x27;s keywords, if available. All HTML tags in the original fields are stripped when returned in this field, and matching query keywords are enclosed in HTML bold tags.
