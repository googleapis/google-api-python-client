The format can either be the resource name (e.g., &quot;projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/my-instance&quot;) or the full resource URI (e.g., &quot;https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-a/instances/my-instance&quot;).

  backupPlanAssociationId: string, Required. The name of the backup plan association to create. The name must be unique for the specified project and location.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. The list of fields to update. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the BackupPlanAssociation resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then the request will fail. Currently backup_plan_association.backup_plan is the only supported field.
