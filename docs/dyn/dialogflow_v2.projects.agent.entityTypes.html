<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="patch">patch(name, body=None, languageCode=None, updateMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the specified entity type. Note: You should always train an agent prior to sending it queries. See the [training documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/training).

Args:
  name: string, The unique identifier of the entity type. Required for EntityTypes.UpdateEntityType and EntityTypes.BatchUpdateEntityTypes methods. Format: `projects//agent/entityTypes/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Each intent parameter has a type, called the entity type, which dictates exactly how data from an end-user expression is extracted. Dialogflow provides predefined system entities that can match many common types of data. For example, there are system entities for matching dates, times, colors, email addresses, and so on. You can also create your own custom entities for matching custom data. For example, you could define a vegetable entity that can match the types of vegetables available for purchase with a grocery store agent. For more information, see the [Entity guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).
  &quot;autoExpansionMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Indicates whether the entity type can be automatically expanded.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the entity type.
  &quot;enableFuzzyExtraction&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Enables fuzzy entity extraction during classification.
  &quot;entities&quot;: [ # Optional. The collection of entity entries associated with the entity type.
    { # An **entity entry** for an associated entity type.
      &quot;synonyms&quot;: [ # Required. A collection of value synonyms. For example, if the entity type is *vegetable*, and `value` is *scallions*, a synonym could be *green onions*. For `KIND_LIST` entity types: * This collection must contain exactly one synonym equal to `value`.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The primary value associated with this entity entry. For example, if the entity type is *vegetable*, the value could be *scallions*. For `KIND_MAP` entity types: * A reference value to be used in place of synonyms. For `KIND_LIST` entity types: * A string that can contain references to other entity types (with or without aliases).
    },
  ],
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Indicates the kind of entity type.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique identifier of the entity type. Required for EntityTypes.UpdateEntityType and EntityTypes.BatchUpdateEntityTypes methods. Format: `projects//agent/entityTypes/`.
}

  languageCode: string, Optional. The language used to access language-specific data. If not specified, the agent&#x27;s default language is used. For more information, see [Multilingual intent and entity data](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-multilingual#intent-entity).
  updateMask: string, Optional. The mask to control which fields get updated.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
