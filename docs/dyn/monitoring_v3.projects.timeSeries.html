Args:

  orderBy: string, Unsupported: must be left blank. The points in each time series are returned in reverse time order.
  pageSize: integer, A positive number that is the maximum number of results to return. If page_size is empty or more than 100,000 results, the effective page_size is 100,000 results. If view is set to FULL, this is the maximum number of Points returned. If view is set to HEADERS, this is the maximum number of TimeSeries returned.

      2 - v2 error format

If perSeriesAligner is specified and does not equal ALIGN_NONE, then this field must be defined; otherwise an error is returned.
  pageToken: string, If this field is not empty then it must contain the nextPageToken value returned by a previous call to this method. Using this field causes the method to return additional results from the previous method call.
  aggregation_groupByFields: string, The set of fields to preserve when crossSeriesReducer is specified. The groupByFields determine how the time series are partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation function. Each subset contains time series that have the same value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time series is a member of exactly one subset. The crossSeriesReducer is applied to each subset of time series. It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so this field implicitly contains resource.type. Fields not specified in groupByFields are aggregated away.

Alignment may change the metric type or the value type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If crossSeriesReducer is specified, then perSeriesAligner must be specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE and alignmentPeriod must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.
  interval_endTime: string, Required. The end of the time interval.
  aggregation_crossSeriesReducer: string, The approach to be used to combine time series. Not all reducer functions may be applied to all time series, depending on the metric type and the value type of the original time series. Reduction may change the metric type of value type of the time series.Time series data must be aligned in order to perform cross-time series reduction. If crossSeriesReducer is specified, then perSeriesAligner must be specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE and alignmentPeriod must be specified; otherwise, an error is returned.
  filter: string, A monitoring filter that specifies which time series should be returned. The filter must specify a single metric type, and can additionally specify metric labels and other information. For example:
metric.type = "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/usage_time" AND
    metric.labels.instance_name = "my-instance-name"

  interval_startTime: string, Optional. The beginning of the time interval. The default value for the start time is the end time. The start time must not be later than the end time.
