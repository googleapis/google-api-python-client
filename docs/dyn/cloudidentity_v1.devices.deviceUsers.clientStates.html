</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, customer=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the client state for the device user

Args:
  name: string, Required. [Resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the ClientState in format: `devices/{device}/deviceUsers/{device_user}/clientStates/{partner}`, where `device` is the unique ID assigned to the Device, `device_user` is the unique ID assigned to the User and `partner` identifies the partner storing the data. To get the client state for devices belonging to your own organization, the `partnerId` is in the format: `customerId-*anystring*`. Where the `customerId` is your organization&#x27;s customer ID and `anystring` is any suffix. This suffix is used in setting up Custom Access Levels in Context-Aware Access. You may use `my_customer` instead of the customer ID for devices managed by your own organization. You may specify `-` in place of the `{device}`, so the ClientState resource name can be: `devices/-/deviceUsers/{device_user_resource}/clientStates/{partner}`. (required)
  customer: string, Optional. [Resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the customer. If you&#x27;re using this API for your own organization, use `customers/my_customer` If you&#x27;re using this API to manage another organization, use `customers/{customer}`, where customer is the customer to whom the device belongs.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
