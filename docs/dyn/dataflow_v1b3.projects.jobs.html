  <pre>Creates a dataflow job.

Args:
  projectId: string, The project which owns the job. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Defines a job to be run by the Dataflow service.
    "clientRequestId": "A String", # Client's unique identifier of the job, re-used by SDK across retried attempts. If this field is set, the service will ensure its uniqueness. That is, the request to create a job will fail if the service has knowledge of a previously submitted job with the same client's id and job name. The caller may, for example, use this field to ensure idempotence of job creation across retried attempts to create a job. By default, the field is empty and, in that case, the service ignores it.
    "requestedState": "A String", # The job's requested state. UpdateJob may be used to switch between the JOB_STATE_STOPPED and JOB_STATE_RUNNING states, by setting requested_state. UpdateJob may also be used to directly set a job's requested state to JOB_STATE_CANCELLED or JOB_STATE_DONE, irrevocably terminating the job if it has not already reached a terminal state.
    "name": "A String", # The user-specified Dataflow job name. Only one Job with a given name may exist in a project at any given time. If a caller attempts to create a Job with the same name as an already-existing Job, the attempt will return the existing Job. The name must match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]{0,38}[a-z0-9])?
    "replacedByJobId": "A String", # If another job is an update of this job (and thus, this job is in JOB_STATE_UPDATED), this field will contain the ID of that job.

If not specified, the default value is "http://www.googleapis.com/"
            "taskUser": "A String", # The UNIX user ID on the worker VM to use for tasks launched by taskrunner; e.g. "root".
            "taskGroup": "A String", # The UNIX group ID on the worker VM to use for tasks launched by taskrunner; e.g. "wheel".

TEARDOWN_ALWAYS means workers are always torn down regardless of whether the job succeeds. TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS means workers are torn down if the job succeeds. TEARDOWN_NEVER means the workers are never torn down. If the workers are not torn down by the service, they will continue to run and use Google Compute Engine VM resources in the user's project until they are explicitly terminated by the user. Because of this, Google recommends using the TEARDOWN_ALWAYS policy except for small, manually supervised test jobs. If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default.

            { # Packages that need to be installed in order for a worker to run the steps of the Dataflow job which will be assigned to its worker pool.

              "name": "A String", # The name of the package.
              "location": "A String", # The resource to read the package from. The supported resource type is: Google Cloud Storage: storage.googleapis.com/{bucket} bucket.storage.googleapis.com/

If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default. For example, the standard persistent disk type is a resource name typically ending in "pd-standard". If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with "pd-ssd". The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone. Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this: compute.googleapis.com/projects/
                  # /zones//diskTypes/pd-standard

      { # Defines a particular step within a Dataflow job. A job consists of multiple steps, each of which performs some specific operation as part of the overall job. Data is typically passed from one step to another as part of the job. Here's an example of a sequence of steps which together implement a Map-Reduce job: * Read a collection of data from some source, parsing the collection's elements. * Validate the elements. * Apply a user-defined function to map each element to some value and extract an element-specific key value. * Group elements with the same key into a single element with that key, transforming a multiply-keyed collection into a uniquely-keyed collection. * Write the elements out to some data sink. (Note that the Dataflow service may be used to run many different types of jobs, not just Map-Reduce).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(projectId, jobId, x__xgafv=None, view=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the state of the specified dataflow job.

Args:
  projectId: string, The project which owns the job. (required)
  jobId: string, Identifies a single job. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
  view: string, Level of information requested in response.

TEARDOWN_NEVER means the workers are never torn down. If the workers are not torn down by the service, they will continue to run and use Google Compute Engine VM resources in the user's project until they are explicitly terminated by the user. Because of this, Google recommends using the TEARDOWN_ALWAYS policy except for small, manually supervised test jobs.

If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with "pd-ssd". The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone. Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this: compute.googleapis.com/projects/

TEARDOWN_ALWAYS means workers are always torn down regardless of whether the job succeeds. TEARDOWN_ON_SUCCESS means workers are torn down if the job succeeds. TEARDOWN_NEVER means the workers are never torn down. If the workers are not torn down by the service, they will continue to run and use Google Compute Engine VM resources in the user's project until they are explicitly terminated by the user. Because of this, Google recommends using the TEARDOWN_ALWAYS policy except for small, manually supervised test jobs.

If unknown or unspecified, the service will attempt to choose a reasonable default. For example, the standard persistent disk type is a resource name typically ending in "pd-standard". If SSD persistent disks are available, the resource name typically ends with "pd-ssd". The actual valid values are defined the Google Compute Engine API, not by the Dataflow API; consult the Google Compute Engine documentation for more information about determining the set of available disk types for a particular project and zone. Google Compute Engine Disk types are local to a particular project in a particular zone, and so the resource name will typically look something like this: compute.googleapis.com/projects/

Data is typically passed from one step to another as part of the job. Here's an example of a sequence of steps which together implement a Map-Reduce job: * Read a collection of data from some source, parsing the collection's elements. * Validate the elements. * Apply a user-defined function to map each element to some value and extract an element-specific key value. * Group elements with the same key into a single element with that key, transforming a multiply-keyed collection into a uniquely-keyed collection. * Write the elements out to some data sink. (Note that the Dataflow service may be used to run many different types of jobs, not just Map-Reduce).
