  <pre>Locates the closest building to a query point. Returns an error with code `NOT_FOUND` if there are no buildings within approximately 50m of the query point.

Args:
  location_latitude: number, The latitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-90.0, +90.0].
  location_longitude: number, The longitude in degrees. It must be in the range [-180.0, +180.0].
  requiredQuality: string, Optional. The minimum quality level allowed in the results. No result with lower quality than this will be returned. Not specifying this is equivalent to restricting to HIGH quality only.
    Allowed values
      IMAGERY_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED - No quality is known.
      HIGH - Solar data is derived from aerial imagery captured at low-altitude and processed at 0.1 m/pixel.
      MEDIUM - Solar data is derived from enhanced aerial imagery captured at high-altitude and processed at 0.25 m/pixel.
      LOW - Solar data is derived from enhanced satellite imagery processed at 0.25 m/pixel.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
