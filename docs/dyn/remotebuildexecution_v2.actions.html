  <pre>Execute an action remotely.

In order to execute an action, the client must first upload all of the
inputs, the
Command to run, and the
Action into the
ContentAddressableStorage.
It then calls `Execute` with an `action_digest` referring to them. The
server will run the action and eventually return the result.

The input `Action`&#x27;s fields MUST meet the various canonicalization
requirements specified in the documentation for their types so that it has
the same digest as other logically equivalent `Action`s. The server MAY
enforce the requirements and return errors if a non-canonical input is
received. It MAY also proceed without verifying some or all of the
requirements, such as for performance reasons. If the server does not
verify the requirement, then it will treat the `Action` as distinct from
another logically equivalent action if they hash differently.

Returns a stream of
google.longrunning.Operation messages
describing the resulting execution, with eventual `response`
ExecuteResponse. The
`metadata` on the operation is of type
ExecuteOperationMetadata.

If the client remains connected after the first response is returned after
the server, then updates are streamed as if the client had called
WaitExecution
until the execution completes or the request reaches an error. The
operation can also be queried using Operations
API.

The server NEED NOT implement other methods or functionality of the
Operations API.

Errors discovered during creation of the `Operation` will be reported
as gRPC Status errors, while errors that occurred while running the
action will be reported in the `status` field of the `ExecuteResponse`. The
server MUST NOT set the `error` field of the `Operation` proto.
The possible errors include:

* `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: One or more arguments are invalid.
* `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: One or more errors occurred in setting up the
  action requested, such as a missing input or command or no worker being
  available. The client may be able to fix the errors and retry.
* `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: There is insufficient quota of some resource to run
  the action.
* `UNAVAILABLE`: Due to a transient condition, such as all workers being
  occupied (and the server does not support a queue), the action could not
  be started. The client should retry.
* `INTERNAL`: An internal error occurred in the execution engine or the
  worker.
* `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The execution timed out.
* `CANCELLED`: The operation was cancelled by the client. This status is
  only possible if the server implements the Operations API CancelOperation
  method, and it was called for the current execution.

In the case of a missing input or command, the server SHOULD additionally
send a PreconditionFailure error detail
where, for each requested blob not present in the CAS, there is a
`Violation` with a `type` of `MISSING` and a `subject` of
`&quot;blobs/{hash}/{size}&quot;` indicating the digest of the missing blob.

Args:
  instanceName: string, The instance of the execution system to operate against. A server may
support multiple instances of the execution system (with their own workers,
storage, caches, etc.). The server MAY require use of this field to select
between them in an implementation-defined fashion, otherwise it can be
omitted. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request message for
      # Execution.Execute.
    &quot;resultsCachePolicy&quot;: { # A `ResultsCachePolicy` is used for fine-grained control over how action # An optional policy for the results of this execution in the remote cache.
        # The server will have a default policy if this is not provided.
        # This may be applied to both the ActionResult and the associated blobs.
        # outputs are stored in the CAS and Action Cache.
      &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # The priority (relative importance) of this content in the overall cache.
          # Generally, a lower value means a longer retention time or other advantage,
          # but the interpretation of a given value is server-dependent. A priority of
          # 0 means a *default* value, decided by the server.
          #
          # The particular semantics of this field is up to the server. In particular,
          # every server will have their own supported range of priorities, and will
          # decide how these map into retention/eviction policy.
    },
    &quot;skipCacheLookup&quot;: True or False, # If true, the action will be executed even if its result is already
        # present in the ActionCache.
        # The execution is still allowed to be merged with other in-flight executions
        # of the same action, however - semantically, the service MUST only guarantee
        # that the results of an execution with this field set were not visible
        # before the corresponding execution request was sent.
        # Note that actions from execution requests setting this field set are still
        # eligible to be entered into the action cache upon completion, and services
        # SHOULD overwrite any existing entries that may exist. This allows
        # skip_cache_lookup requests to be used as a mechanism for replacing action
        # cache entries that reference outputs no longer available or that are
        # poisoned in any way.
        # If false, the result may be served from the action cache.
    &quot;actionDigest&quot;: { # A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob # The digest of the Action to
        # execute.
        # and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server.
        #
        # The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be
        # separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but
        # `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request.
        #
        # The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great
        # many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work
        # with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree
        # structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could
        # implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more
        # complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size
        # up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where
        # digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation
        # details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but
        # we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.
        #
        # When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the
        # message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and
        # servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following
        # rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message:
        #
        # * Fields are serialized in tag order.
        # * There are no unknown fields.
        # * There are no duplicate fields.
        # * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.
        #
        # Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when
        # serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance,
        # concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.
      &quot;sizeBytes&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The size of the blob, in bytes.
      &quot;hash&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The hash. In the case of SHA-256, it will always be a lowercase hex string
          # exactly 64 characters long.
    },
    &quot;executionPolicy&quot;: { # An `ExecutionPolicy` can be used to control the scheduling of the action. # An optional policy for execution of the action.
        # The server will have a default policy if this is not provided.
      &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # The priority (relative importance) of this action. Generally, a lower value
          # means that the action should be run sooner than actions having a greater
          # priority value, but the interpretation of a given value is server-
          # dependent. A priority of 0 means the *default* priority. Priorities may be
          # positive or negative, and such actions should run later or sooner than
          # actions having the default priority, respectively. The particular semantics
          # of this field is up to the server. In particular, every server will have
          # their own supported range of priorities, and will decide how these map into
          # scheduling policy.
