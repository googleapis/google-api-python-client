<p class="firstline"> Creates a new file. This method supports an */upload* URI and accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics: - *Maximum file size:* 5,120 GB - *Accepted Media MIME types:*`*/*` Note: Specify a valid MIME type, rather than the literal `*/*` value. The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see [Upload file data](/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads). Apps creating shortcuts with `files.create` must specify the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`. Apps should specify a file extension in the `name` property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `"name": "cat.jpg"` in the metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the read-only `fileExtension` property populated with the extension originally specified in the `title` property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with extension) based on the title. In cases where the extension is missing, Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the file's MIME type.</p>

  <pre> Creates a new file. This method supports an */upload* URI and accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics: - *Maximum file size:* 5,120 GB - *Accepted Media MIME types:*`*/*` Note: Specify a valid MIME type, rather than the literal `*/*` value. The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see [Upload file data](/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads). Apps creating shortcuts with `files.create` must specify the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`. Apps should specify a file extension in the `name` property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `&quot;name&quot;: &quot;cat.jpg&quot;` in the metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the read-only `fileExtension` property populated with the extension originally specified in the `title` property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with extension) based on the title. In cases where the extension is missing, Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the file&#x27;s MIME type.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  <pre> Gets a file&#x27;s metadata or content by ID. If you provide the URL parameter `alt=media`, then the response includes the file contents in the response body. Downloading content with `alt=media` only works if the file is stored in Drive. To download Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides use [`files.export`](/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/files/export) instead.

Args:
  fileId: string, The ID of the file. (required)
  acknowledgeAbuse: boolean, Whether the user is acknowledging the risk of downloading known malware or other abusive files. This is only applicable when the `alt` parameter is set to `media` and the user is the owner of the file or an organizer of the shared drive in which the file resides.
  includeLabels: string, A comma-separated list of IDs of labels to include in the `labelInfo` part of the response.
