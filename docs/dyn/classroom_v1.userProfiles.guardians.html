<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(studentId, guardianId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a guardian.

The guardian will no longer receive guardian notifications and the guardian
will no longer be accessible via the API.

This method returns the following error codes:

* `PERMISSION_DENIED` if no user that matches the provided `student_id`
  is visible to the requesting user, if the requesting user is not
  permitted to manage guardians for the student identified by the
  `student_id`, if guardians are not enabled for the domain in question,
  or for other access errors.
* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a `student_id` is specified, but its format cannot
  be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `student_id` from the
  API).
* `NOT_FOUND` if the requesting user is permitted to modify guardians for
  the requested `student_id`, but no `Guardian` record exists for that
  student with the provided `guardian_id`.

Args:
  studentId: string, The student whose guardian is to be deleted. One of the following:

* the numeric identifier for the user
* the email address of the user
* the string literal `"me"`, indicating the requesting user (required)
  guardianId: string, The `id` field from a `Guardian`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(studentId, guardianId, x__xgafv=None)</code>

  <pre>Returns a list of guardians that the requesting user is permitted to
view, restricted to those that match the request.

To list guardians for any student that the requesting user may view
guardians for, use the literal character `-` for the student ID.

This method returns the following error codes:

* `PERMISSION_DENIED` if a `student_id` is specified, and the requesting
  user is not permitted to view guardian information for that student, if
  `"-"` is specified as the `student_id` and the user is not a domain
  administrator, if guardians are not enabled for the domain in question,
  if the `invited_email_address` filter is set by a user who is not a
  domain administrator, or for other access errors.
* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if a `student_id` is specified, but its format cannot
  be recognized (it is not an email address, nor a `student_id` from the
  API, nor the literal string `me`). May also be returned if an invalid
  `page_token` is provided.
* `NOT_FOUND` if a `student_id` is specified, and its format can be
  recognized, but Classroom has no record of that student.

Args:
  studentId: string, Filter results by the student who the guardian is linked to.
The identifier can be one of the following:

* the numeric identifier for the user

  all students that the requesting user has access to view. (required)
  invitedEmailAddress: string, Filter results by the email address that the original invitation was sent
to, resulting in this guardian link.
This filter can only be used by domain administrators.

The server may return fewer than the specified number of results.
  pageToken: string, nextPageToken
value returned from a previous

The list request
must be otherwise identical to the one that resulted in this token.
