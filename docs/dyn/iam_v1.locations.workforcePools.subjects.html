Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the WorkforcePoolSubject. Special characters, like &#x27;/&#x27; and &#x27;:&#x27;, must be escaped, because all URLs need to conform to the &quot;When to Escape and Unescape&quot; section of [RFC3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt). Format: `locations/{location}/workforcePools/{workforce_pool_id}/subjects/{subject_id}` (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
