<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves an aggregated list of autoscalers.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

Compute Engine Beta API Only: When filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of autoscalers contained within the specified zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, Name of the zone for this request. (required)
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.

The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.

Compute Engine Beta API Only: When filtering in the Beta API, you can also filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.

The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.

    <code class="details" id="update">update(project, zone, body, autoscaler=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates an autoscaler in the specified project using the data included in the request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, Name of the zone for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents an Autoscaler resource. Autoscalers allow you to automatically scale virtual machine instances in managed instance groups according to an autoscaling policy that you define. For more information, read Autoscaling Groups of Instances.
    "kind": "compute#autoscaler", # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#autoscaler for autoscalers.
    "description": "A String", # An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
    "zone": "A String", # [Output Only] URL of the zone where the instance group resides.
    "autoscalingPolicy": { # Cloud Autoscaler policy. # The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization, customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.
        # 
        # If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based on cpuUtilization to 0.8 or 80%.
      "maxNumReplicas": 42, # The maximum number of instances that the autoscaler can scale up to. This is required when creating or updating an autoscaler. The maximum number of replicas should not be lower than minimal number of replicas.
      "coolDownPeriodSec": 42, # The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is initializing, during which the collected usage would not be reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
          #
          # Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance and time the startup process.
      "loadBalancingUtilization": { # Configuration parameters of autoscaling based on load balancing. # Configuration parameters of autoscaling based on load balancer.
        "utilizationTarget": 3.14, # Fraction of backend capacity utilization (set in HTTP(s) load balancing configuration) that autoscaler should maintain. Must be a positive float value. If not defined, the default is 0.8.

        { # Custom utilization metric policy.
          "metric": "A String", # The identifier of the Cloud Monitoring metric. The metric cannot have negative values and should be a utilization metric, which means that the number of virtual machines handling requests should increase or decrease proportionally to the metric. The metric must also have a label of compute.googleapis.com/resource_id with the value of the instance's unique ID, although this alone does not guarantee that the metric is valid.
              #
              # For example, the following is a valid metric:
              # compute.googleapis.com/instance/network/received_bytes_count
              #
              #
              # The following is not a valid metric because it does not increase or decrease based on usage:
              # compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/reserved_cores
          "utilizationTargetType": "A String", # Defines how target utilization value is expressed for a Cloud Monitoring metric. Either GAUGE, DELTA_PER_SECOND, or DELTA_PER_MINUTE. If not specified, the default is GAUGE.
          "utilizationTarget": 3.14, # Target value of the metric which autoscaler should maintain. Must be a positive value.
        },
      ],
      "cpuUtilization": { # CPU utilization policy. # Defines the CPU utilization policy that allows the autoscaler to scale based on the average CPU utilization of a managed instance group.
        "utilizationTarget": 3.14, # The target CPU utilization that the autoscaler should maintain. Must be a float value in the range (0, 1]. If not specified, the default is 0.8.
            #
            # If the CPU level is below the target utilization, the autoscaler scales down the number of instances until it reaches the minimum number of instances you specified or until the average CPU of your instances reaches the target utilization.
            #
            # If the average CPU is above the target utilization, the autoscaler scales up until it reaches the maximum number of instances you specified or until the average utilization reaches the target utilization.
      },
      "minNumReplicas": 42, # The minimum number of replicas that the autoscaler can scale down to. This cannot be less than 0. If not provided, autoscaler will choose a default value depending on maximum number of instances allowed.
    },
    "target": "A String", # URL of the managed instance group that this autoscaler will scale.
    "creationTimestamp": "A String", # [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
    "id": "A String", # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.
    "selfLink": "A String", # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    "name": "A String", # Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
