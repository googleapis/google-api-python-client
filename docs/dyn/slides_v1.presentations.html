<p class="firstline">Applies one or more updates to the presentation. Each request is validated before being applied. If any request is not valid, then the entire request will fail and nothing will be applied. Some requests have replies to give you some information about how they are applied. Other requests do not need to return information; these each return an empty reply. The order of replies matches that of the requests. For example, suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the third one returns information. The response would have two empty replies: the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order. Because other users may be editing the presentation, the presentation might not exactly reflect your changes: your changes may be altered with respect to collaborator changes.

However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`. If so, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned. * If `weighted_font_family` is set and `font_family` is not, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. * If neither field is set, the font family and weight of the text inherit from the parent. Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

This field is an extension of `font_family` meant to support explicit font weights without breaking backwards compatibility. As such, when reading the style of a range of text, the value of `weighted_font_family#font_family` will always be equal to that of `font_family`. However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`. If so, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned. * If `weighted_font_family` is set and `font_family` is not, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. * If neither field is set, the font family and weight of the text inherit from the parent. Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`.

Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value.

A returned revision ID is only guaranteed to be valid for 24 hours after it has been returned and cannot be shared across users. If the revision ID is unchanged between calls, then the presentation has not changed. Conversely, a changed ID (for the same presentation and user) usually means the presentation has been updated. However, a changed ID can also be due to internal factors such as ID format changes.

Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value.

As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request.

As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request.

If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters.

However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`. If so, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned. * If `weighted_font_family` is set and `font_family` is not, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. * If neither field is set, the font family and weight of the text inherit from the parent. Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters. As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request.

However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`.

Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`. If so, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned. * If `weighted_font_family` is set and `font_family` is not, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. * If neither field is set, the font family and weight of the text inherit from the parent. Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

This range corresponds to the numerical values described in the CSS 2.1 Specification, [section 15.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#font-boldness), with non-numerical values disallowed. Weights greater than or equal to `700` are considered bold, and weights less than `700`are not bold. The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;).

If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters. As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs.

However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`.

Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters. As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs.

Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value.

This field is an extension of `font_family` meant to support explicit font weights without breaking backwards compatibility. As such, when reading the style of a range of text, the value of `weighted_font_family#font_family` will always be equal to that of `font_family`. However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`. If so, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned. * If `weighted_font_family` is set and `font_family` is not, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. * If neither field is set, the font family and weight of the text inherit from the parent. Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters. As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request.

However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `&quot;*&quot;`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`.

Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value.

As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs.

Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value.
