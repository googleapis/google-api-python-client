  <pre>Fetches the representation of an existing DnsKey.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)
  managedZone: string, Identifies the managed zone addressed by this request. Can be the managed zone name or ID. (required)
  dnsKeyId: string, The identifier of the requested DnsKey. (required)
  clientOperationId: string, For mutating operation requests only. An optional identifier specified by the client. Must be unique for operation resources in the Operations collection.
  digestType: string, An optional comma-separated list of digest types to compute and display for key signing keys. If omitted, the recommended digest type is computed and displayed.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
