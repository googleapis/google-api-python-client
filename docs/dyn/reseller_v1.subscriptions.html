<p class="firstline">Update a subscription plan. Use this method to update a plan for a 30-day trial or a flexible plan subscription to an annual commitment plan with monthly or yearly payments. How a plan is updated differs depending on the plan and the products.

For more information about creating a subscription for different payment plans, see [manage subscriptions](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_subscriptions#create_subscription).\ If you did not order the customer's account using the customer insert method, use the customer's `customerAuthToken` when creating a subscription for that customer. If transferring a G Suite subscription with an associated Google Drive or Google Vault subscription, use the [batch operation](/admin-sdk/reseller/v1/how-tos/batch.html) to transfer all of these subscriptions.

<p class="toc_element">
  <code><a href="#suspend">suspend(customerId, subscriptionId, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Suspends an active subscription. You can use this method to suspend a paid subscription that is currently in the `ACTIVE` state. * For `FLEXIBLE` subscriptions, billing is paused. * For `ANNUAL_MONTHLY_PAY` or `ANNUAL_YEARLY_PAY` subscriptions: * Suspending the subscription does not change the renewal date that was originally committed to. * A suspended subscription does not renew. If you activate the subscription after the original renewal date, a new annual subscription will be created, starting on the day of activation. We strongly encourage you to suspend subscriptions only for short periods of time as suspensions over 60 days may result in the subscription being cancelled.</p>
