  <pre>Creates a new SingleTenantHsmInstance in a given Project and Location. User must create a RegisterTwoFactorAuthKeys proposal with this single-tenant HSM instance to finish setup of the instance.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the location associated with the SingleTenantHsmInstance, in the format `projects/*/locations/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A SingleTenantHsmInstance represents a single-tenant HSM instance. It can be used for creating CryptoKeys with a ProtectionLevel of HSM_SINGLE_TENANT, as well as performing cryptographic operations using keys created within the SingleTenantHsmInstance.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the SingleTenantHsmInstance was created.
  &quot;deleteTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the SingleTenantHsmInstance was deleted.
  &quot;disableTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the instance will be automatically disabled if not refreshed. This field is updated upon creation and after each successful refresh operation and enable. A RefreshSingleTenantHsmInstance operation must be made via a SingleTenantHsmInstanceProposal before this time otherwise the SingleTenantHsmInstance will become disabled.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The resource name for this SingleTenantHsmInstance in the format `projects/*/locations/*/singleTenantHsmInstances/*`.
  &quot;quorumAuth&quot;: { # Configuration for M of N quorum auth. # Required. The quorum auth configuration for the SingleTenantHsmInstance.
    &quot;requiredApproverCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. The required numbers of approvers. The M value used for M of N quorum auth. Must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to total_approver_count - 1.
    &quot;totalApproverCount&quot;: 42, # Required. The total number of approvers. This is the N value used for M of N quorum auth. Must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 16.
    &quot;twoFactorPublicKeyPems&quot;: [ # Output only. The public keys associated with the 2FA keys for M of N quorum auth.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the SingleTenantHsmInstance.
  &quot;unrefreshedDurationUntilDisable&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The system-defined duration that an instance can remain unrefreshed until it is automatically disabled. This will have a value of 120 days.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
