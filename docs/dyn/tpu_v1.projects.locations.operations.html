<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="cancel">cancel(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.  The server
makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
guaranteed.  If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
`google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.  Clients can use
Operations.GetOperation or
other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the
operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,
the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with
an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,
corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a long-running operation. This method indicates that the client is
no longer interested in the operation result. It does not cancel the
operation. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
`google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation resource to be deleted. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {

      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the latest state of a long-running operation.  Clients can use this
method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API
service.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation resource. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
        # message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
          # message types for APIs to use.
        {
          "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  }</pre>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(name, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None, pageSize=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the
server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding
to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To
override the binding, API services can add a binding such as
`"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration.
For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations
collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding
is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the operation's parent resource. (required)
  pageToken: string, The standard list page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  pageSize: integer, The standard list page size.
  filter: string, The standard list filter.
