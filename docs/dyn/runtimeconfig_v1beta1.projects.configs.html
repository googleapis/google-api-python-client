Args:
  parent: string, The [project
ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158840?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6158848)

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A RuntimeConfig resource is the primary resource in the Cloud RuntimeConfig
      # service. A RuntimeConfig resource consists of metadata and a hierarchy of
      # variables.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of a runtime config. The name must have the format:
        # 
        #     projects/[PROJECT_ID]/configs/[CONFIG_NAME]
        # 
        # The `[PROJECT_ID]` must be a valid project ID, and `[CONFIG_NAME]` is an
        # arbitrary name that matches the
        # `[0-9A-Za-z](?:[_.A-Za-z0-9-]{0,62}[_.A-Za-z0-9])?` regular expression.
        # The length of `[CONFIG_NAME]` must be less than 64 characters.
        # 
        # You pick the RuntimeConfig resource name, but the server will validate that
        # the name adheres to this format. After you create the resource, you cannot

    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An optional description of the RuntimeConfig object.
  }

  requestId: string, An optional but recommended unique `request_id`. If the server
receives two `create()` requests  with the same
`request_id`, then the second request will be ignored and the
first resource created and stored in the backend is returned.
Empty `request_id` fields are ignored.

It is responsibility of the client to ensure uniqueness of the
`request_id` strings.

`request_id` strings are limited to 64 characters.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
      # controls for Google Cloud resources.
      #
      #
      # A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.
      #
      # For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a
      # `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource
      # only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints
      # based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which
      # resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the
      # [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

        # Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version

        #
        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
        # * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field
        # whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows
        # you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
        # the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        #
        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
        # specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

        # * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding
        # * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy
        # * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy

        #   that includes conditions
        #
        # **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

        # If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;storage.*&#x27;) are not allowed. For more
