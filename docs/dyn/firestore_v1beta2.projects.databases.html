<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="exportDocuments">exportDocuments(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Exports a copy of all or a subset of documents from Google Cloud Firestore
to another storage system, such as Google Cloud Storage. Recent updates to
documents may not be reflected in the export. The export occurs in the
background and its progress can be monitored and managed via the
Operation resource that is created. The output of an export may only be
used once the associated operation is done. If an export operation is
cancelled before completion it may leave partial data behind in Google
Cloud Storage.

Args:
  name: string, Database to export. Should be of the form:
`projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for FirestoreAdmin.ExportDocuments.
    &quot;collectionIds&quot;: [ # Which collection ids to export. Unspecified means all collections.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;outputUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The output URI. Currently only supports Google Cloud Storage URIs of the
        # form: `gs://BUCKET_NAME[/NAMESPACE_PATH]`, where `BUCKET_NAME` is the name
        # of the Google Cloud Storage bucket and `NAMESPACE_PATH` is an optional
        # Google Cloud Storage namespace path. When
        # choosing a name, be sure to consider Google Cloud Storage naming
        # guidelines: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming.
        # If the URI is a bucket (without a namespace path), a prefix will be
        # generated based on the start time.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

    &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="importDocuments">importDocuments(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Imports documents into Google Cloud Firestore. Existing documents with the
same name are overwritten. The import occurs in the background and its
progress can be monitored and managed via the Operation resource that is
created. If an ImportDocuments operation is cancelled, it is possible
that a subset of the data has already been imported to Cloud Firestore.

Args:

    The object takes the form of:

    &quot;inputUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Location of the exported files.
        # This must match the output_uri_prefix of an ExportDocumentsResponse from
