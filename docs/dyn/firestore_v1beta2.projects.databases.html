<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="exportDocuments">exportDocuments(name, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Exports a copy of all or a subset of documents from Google Cloud Firestore
to another storage system, such as Google Cloud Storage. Recent updates to
documents may not be reflected in the export. The export occurs in the
background and its progress can be monitored and managed via the
Operation resource that is created. The output of an export may only be
used once the associated operation is done. If an export operation is
cancelled before completion it may leave partial data behind in Google
Cloud Storage.

Args:
  name: string, Database to export. Should be of the form:
`projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request for FirestoreAdmin.ExportDocuments.
    "outputUriPrefix": "A String", # The output URI. Currently only supports Google Cloud Storage URIs of the
        # form: `gs://BUCKET_NAME[/NAMESPACE_PATH]`, where `BUCKET_NAME` is the name
        # of the Google Cloud Storage bucket and `NAMESPACE_PATH` is an optional
        # Google Cloud Storage namespace path. When
        # choosing a name, be sure to consider Google Cloud Storage naming
        # guidelines: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming.
        # If the URI is a bucket (without a namespace path), a prefix will be
        # generated based on the start time.
    "collectionIds": [ # Which collection ids to export. Unspecified means all collections.
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },

        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
        # message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
          # message types for APIs to use.
        {
          "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name

        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should have the format of `operations/some/unique/name`.

  <pre>Imports documents into Google Cloud Firestore. Existing documents with the
