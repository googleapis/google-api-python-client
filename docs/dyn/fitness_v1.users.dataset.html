  <pre>Aggregates data of a certain type or stream into buckets divided by a given
type of boundary. Multiple data sets of multiple types and from multiple
sources can be aggregated into exactly one bucket type per request.

Args:
  userId: string, Aggregate data for the person identified. Use &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; to indicate
the authenticated user. Only &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; is supported at this time. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:
