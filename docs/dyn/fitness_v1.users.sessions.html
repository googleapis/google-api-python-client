<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(userId, sessionId, currentTimeMillis=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a session specified by the given session ID.

Args:
  userId: string, Delete a session for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time. (required)
  sessionId: string, The ID of the session to be deleted. (required)
  currentTimeMillis: string, The client's current time in milliseconds since epoch.
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(userId, includeDeleted=None, pageToken=None, startTime=None, endTime=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists sessions previously created.

Args:
  userId: string, List sessions for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time. (required)
  includeDeleted: boolean, If true, deleted sessions will be returned. When set to true, sessions returned in this response will only have an ID and will not have any other fields.
  pageToken: string, The continuation token, which is used for incremental syncing. To get the next batch of changes, set this parameter to the value of nextPageToken from the previous response. This token is treated as a timestamp (in millis since epoch). If specified, the API returns sessions modified since this time. The page token is ignored if either start or end time is specified. If none of start time, end time, and the page token is specified, sessions modified in the last 30 days are returned.
  startTime: string, An RFC3339 timestamp. Only sessions ending between the start and end times will be included in the response.
  endTime: string, An RFC3339 timestamp. Only sessions ending between the start and end times will be included in the response.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    "hasMoreData": True or False, # Flag to indicate server has more data to transfer
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # The continuation token, which is used to page through large result sets. Provide this value in a subsequent request to return the next page of results.
