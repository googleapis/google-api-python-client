<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(userId, sessionId, currentTimeMillis=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes a session specified by the given session ID.

Args:
  userId: string, Delete a session for the person identified. Use &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; to indicate
the authenticated user. Only &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; is supported at this time. (required)
  sessionId: string, The ID of the session to be deleted. (required)
  currentTimeMillis: string, The client&#x27;s current time in milliseconds since epoch.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(userId, endTime=None, startTime=None, pageToken=None, includeDeleted=None, activityType=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists sessions previously created.

Args:
  userId: string, List sessions for the person identified. Use &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; to indicate
the authenticated user. Only &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; is supported at this time. (required)
  endTime: string, An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt&quot;&gt;RFC3339&lt;/a&gt; timestamp.
Only sessions ending between the start and end times will be included in
the response. If this time is omitted but &lt;var&gt;startTime&lt;/var&gt; is
specified, all sessions from &lt;var&gt;startTime&lt;/var&gt; to the end of time will
be returned.
  startTime: string, An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt&quot;&gt;RFC3339&lt;/a&gt; timestamp.
Only sessions ending between the start and end times will be included in

all sessions from the start of time up to &lt;var&gt;endTime&lt;/var&gt; will be
returned.
  pageToken: string, The continuation token, which is used for incremental syncing.
To get the next batch of changes, set this parameter to the value of
&lt;code&gt;nextPageToken&lt;/code&gt; from the previous response. The page token is
ignored if either start or end time is specified. If none of start time,
end time, and the page token is specified, sessions modified in the last
30 days are returned.
  includeDeleted: boolean, If true, and if both &lt;var&gt;startTime&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;endTime&lt;/var&gt; are
omitted, session deletions will be returned.
  activityType: integer, If non-empty, only sessions with these activity types should be returned. (repeated)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
