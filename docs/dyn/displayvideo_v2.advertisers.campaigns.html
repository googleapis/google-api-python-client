  <pre>Permanently deletes a campaign. A deleted campaign cannot be recovered. The campaign should be archived first, i.e. set entity_status to `ENTITY_STATUS_ARCHIVED`, to be able to delete it. **This method regularly experiences high latency.** We recommend [increasing your default timeout](/display-video/api/guides/best-practices/timeouts#client_library_timeout) to avoid errors.

Args:

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
