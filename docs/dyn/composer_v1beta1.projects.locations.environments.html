<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="checkUpgrade">checkUpgrade(environment, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Check if an upgrade operation on the environment will succeed. In case of problems detailed info can be found in the returned Operation.

Args:
  environment: string, The resource name of the environment to check upgrade for, in the form: &quot;projects/{projectId}/locations/{locationId}/environments/{environmentId}&quot; (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to check whether image upgrade will succeed.
  &quot;imageVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The version of the software running in the environment. This encapsulates both the version of Cloud Composer functionality and the version of Apache Airflow. It must match the regular expression `composer-([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-preview\.[0-9]+)?)?|latest)-airflow-([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?)?)`. When used as input, the server also checks if the provided version is supported and denies the request for an unsupported version. The Cloud Composer portion of the image version is a full [semantic version](https://semver.org), or an alias in the form of major version number or `latest`. When an alias is provided, the server replaces it with the current Cloud Composer version that satisfies the alias. The Apache Airflow portion of the image version is a full semantic version that points to one of the supported Apache Airflow versions, or an alias in the form of only major or major.minor versions specified. When an alias is provided, the server replaces it with the latest Apache Airflow version that satisfies the alias and is supported in the given Cloud Composer version. In all cases, the resolved image version is stored in the same field. See also [version list](/composer/docs/concepts/versioning/composer-versions) and [versioning overview](/composer/docs/concepts/versioning/composer-versioning-overview).

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

  updateMask: string, Required. A comma-separated list of paths, relative to `Environment`, of fields to update. For example, to set the version of scikit-learn to install in the environment to 0.19.0 and to remove an existing installation of argparse, the `updateMask` parameter would include the following two `paths` values: &quot;config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.scikit-learn&quot; and &quot;config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.argparse&quot;. The included patch environment would specify the scikit-learn version as follows: { &quot;config&quot;:{ &quot;softwareConfig&quot;:{ &quot;pypiPackages&quot;:{ &quot;scikit-learn&quot;:&quot;==0.19.0&quot; } } } } Note that in the above example, any existing PyPI packages other than scikit-learn and argparse will be unaffected. Only one update type may be included in a single request&#x27;s `updateMask`. For example, one cannot update both the PyPI packages and labels in the same request. However, it is possible to update multiple members of a map field simultaneously in the same request. For example, to set the labels &quot;label1&quot; and &quot;label2&quot; while clearing &quot;label3&quot; (assuming it already exists), one can provide the paths &quot;labels.label1&quot;, &quot;labels.label2&quot;, and &quot;labels.label3&quot; and populate the patch environment as follows: { &quot;labels&quot;:{ &quot;label1&quot;:&quot;new-label1-value&quot; &quot;label2&quot;:&quot;new-label2-value&quot; } } Note that in the above example, any existing labels that are not included in the `updateMask` will be unaffected. It is also possible to replace an entire map field by providing the map field&#x27;s path in the `updateMask`. The new value of the field will be that which is provided in the patch environment. For example, to delete all pre-existing user-specified PyPI packages and install botocore at version 1.7.14, the `updateMask` would contain the path &quot;config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages&quot;, and the patch environment would be the following: { &quot;config&quot;:{ &quot;softwareConfig&quot;:{ &quot;pypiPackages&quot;:{ &quot;botocore&quot;:&quot;==1.7.14&quot; } } } } **Note:** Only the following fields can be updated: * `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages` * Replace all custom custom PyPI packages. If a replacement package map is not included in `environment`, all custom PyPI packages are cleared. It is an error to provide both this mask and a mask specifying an individual package. * `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages.`packagename * Update the custom PyPI package *packagename*, preserving other packages. To delete the package, include it in `updateMask`, and omit the mapping for it in `environment.config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages`. It is an error to provide both a mask of this form and the `config.softwareConfig.pypiPackages` mask. * `labels` * Replace all environment labels. If a replacement labels map is not included in `environment`, all labels are cleared. It is an error to provide both this mask and a mask specifying one or more individual labels. * `labels.`labelName * Set the label named *labelName*, while preserving other labels. To delete the label, include it in `updateMask` and omit its mapping in `environment.labels`. It is an error to provide both a mask of this form and the `labels` mask. * `config.nodeCount` * Horizontally scale the number of nodes in the environment. An integer greater than or equal to 3 must be provided in the `config.nodeCount` field. Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-*.*.*. * `config.webServerNetworkAccessControl` * Replace the environment&#x27;s current WebServerNetworkAccessControl. * `config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides` * Replace all Apache Airflow config overrides. If a replacement config overrides map is not included in `environment`, all config overrides are cleared. It is an error to provide both this mask and a mask specifying one or more individual config overrides. * `config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides.`section-name * Override the Apache Airflow config property *name* in the section named *section*, preserving other properties. To delete the property override, include it in `updateMask` and omit its mapping in `environment.config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides`. It is an error to provide both a mask of this form and the `config.softwareConfig.airflowConfigOverrides` mask. * `config.softwareConfig.envVariables` * Replace all environment variables. If a replacement environment variable map is not included in `environment`, all custom environment variables are cleared. * `config.softwareConfig.imageVersion` * Upgrade the version of the environment in-place. Refer to `SoftwareConfig.image_version` for information on how to format the new image version. Additionally, the new image version cannot effect a version downgrade, and must match the current image version&#x27;s Composer and Airflow major versions. Consult the [Cloud Composer version list](/composer/docs/concepts/versioning/composer-versions) for valid values. * `config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount` * Horizontally scale the number of schedulers in Airflow. A positive integer not greater than the number of nodes must be provided in the `config.softwareConfig.schedulerCount` field. Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-2.*.*. * `config.softwareConfig.cloudDataLineageIntegration` * Configuration for Cloud Data Lineage integration. * `config.databaseConfig.machineType` * Cloud SQL machine type used by Airflow database. It has to be one of: db-n1-standard-2, db-n1-standard-4, db-n1-standard-8 or db-n1-standard-16. Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-*.*.*. * `config.webServerConfig.machineType` * Machine type on which Airflow web server is running. It has to be one of: composer-n1-webserver-2, composer-n1-webserver-4 or composer-n1-webserver-8. Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-1.*.*-airflow-*.*.*. * `config.maintenanceWindow` * Maintenance window during which Cloud Composer components may be under maintenance. * `config.workloadsConfig` * The workloads configuration settings for the GKE cluster associated with the Cloud Composer environment. Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-2.*.*-airflow-*.*.* and newer. * `config.environmentSize` * The size of the Cloud Composer environment. Supported for Cloud Composer environments in versions composer-2.*.*-airflow-*.*.* and newer.
