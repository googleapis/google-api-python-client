  <pre>Atomically update the ResourceRecordSet collection.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)

  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A Change represents a set of ResourceRecordSet additions and deletions applied atomically to a ManagedZone. ResourceRecordSets within a ManagedZone are modified by creating a new Change element in the Changes collection. In turn the Changes collection also records the past modifications to the ResourceRecordSets in a ManagedZone. The current state of the ManagedZone is the sum effect of applying all Change elements in the Changes collection in sequence.
