Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified: ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema. ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.
              "A String",

To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (',').
            "autodetect": True or False, # [Experimental] Indicates if we should automatically infer the options and schema for CSV and JSON sources.
            "sourceFormat": "A String", # [Optional] The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify "CSV". For datastore backups, specify "DATASTORE_BACKUP". For newline-delimited JSON, specify "NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON". For Avro, specify "AVRO". The default value is CSV.

The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
            "maxBadRecords": 42, # [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
            "nullMarker": "A String", # [Optional] This string will be interpreted as a null value when it appears in a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. Please refer to the documentation for further information.
            "allowJaggedRows": True or False, # [Optional] Accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are treated as nulls. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other formats.
            "skipLeadingRows": 42, # [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.

            ],
            "quote": """, # [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
            "createDisposition": "A String", # [Optional] Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
            "schemaInlineFormat": "A String", # [Deprecated] The format of the schemaInline property.
            "schemaInline": "A String", # [Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as "Field1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]*". For example, "foo:STRING, bar:INTEGER, baz:FLOAT".

            ],
            "ignoreUnknownValues": True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don't match any column names

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="query">query(projectId, body)</code>
  <pre>Runs a BigQuery SQL query synchronously and returns query results if the query completes within a specified timeout.

Args:
  projectId: string, Project ID of the project billed for the query (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "timeoutMs": 42, # [Optional] How long to wait for the query to complete, in milliseconds, before the request times out and returns. Note that this is only a timeout for the request, not the query. If the query takes longer to run than the timeout value, the call returns without any results and with the 'jobComplete' flag set to false. You can call GetQueryResults() to wait for the query to complete and read the results. The default value is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).
    "kind": "bigquery#queryRequest", # The resource type of the request.
    "dryRun": True or False, # [Optional] If set to true, BigQuery doesn't run the job. Instead, if the query is valid, BigQuery returns statistics about the job such as how many bytes would be processed. If the query is invalid, an error returns. The default value is false.
    "parameterMode": "A String", # [Experimental] Standard SQL only. Whether to use positional (?) or named (@myparam) query parameters in this query.
    "useQueryCache": true, # [Optional] Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever tables in the query are modified. The default value is true.
    "defaultDataset": { # [Optional] Specifies the default datasetId and projectId to assume for any unqualified table names in the query. If not set, all table names in the query string must be qualified in the format 'datasetId.tableId'.
      "projectId": "A String", # [Optional] The ID of the project containing this dataset.
      "datasetId": "A String", # [Required] A unique ID for this dataset, without the project name. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 1,024 characters.
    },
    "useLegacySql": true, # Specifies whether to use BigQuery's legacy SQL dialect for this query. The default value is true. If set to false, the query will use BigQuery's standard SQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ When useLegacySql is set to false, the values of allowLargeResults and flattenResults are ignored; query will be run as if allowLargeResults is true and flattenResults is false.
    "maxResults": 42, # [Optional] The maximum number of rows of data to return per page of results. Setting this flag to a small value such as 1000 and then paging through results might improve reliability when the query result set is large. In addition to this limit, responses are also limited to 10 MB. By default, there is no maximum row count, and only the byte limit applies.
    "queryParameters": [ # [Experimental] Query parameters for Standard SQL queries.
      {
        "parameterType": { # [Required] The type of this parameter.
          "structTypes": [ # [Optional] The types of the fields of this struct, in order, if this is a struct.
            {
              "type": # Object with schema name: QueryParameterType # [Required] The type of this field.
              "description": "A String", # [Optional] Human-oriented description of the field.
              "name": "A String", # [Optional] The name of this field.
            },
          ],
          "type": "A String", # [Required] The top level type of this field.
          "arrayType": # Object with schema name: QueryParameterType # [Optional] The type of the array's elements, if this is an array.
        },
        "parameterValue": { # [Required] The value of this parameter.
          "structValues": { # [Optional] The struct field values, in order of the struct type's declaration.
            "a_key": # Object with schema name: QueryParameterValue
          },
          "arrayValues": [ # [Optional] The array values, if this is an array type.
            # Object with schema name: QueryParameterValue
          ],
          "value": "A String", # [Optional] The value of this value, if a simple scalar type.
        },
        "name": "A String", # [Optional] If unset, this is a positional parameter. Otherwise, should be unique within a query.
      },
    ],
    "query": "A String", # [Required] A query string, following the BigQuery query syntax, of the query to execute. Example: "SELECT count(f1) FROM [myProjectId:myDatasetId.myTableId]".
    "preserveNulls": True or False, # [Deprecated] This property is deprecated.
  }


Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "kind": "bigquery#queryResponse", # The resource type.
    "errors": [ # [Output-only] All errors and warnings encountered during the running of the job. Errors here do not necessarily mean that the job has completed or was unsuccessful.

        "location": "A String", # Specifies where the error occurred, if present.
      },
    ],
    "jobReference": { # Reference to the Job that was created to run the query. This field will be present even if the original request timed out, in which case GetQueryResults can be used to read the results once the query has completed. Since this API only returns the first page of results, subsequent pages can be fetched via the same mechanism (GetQueryResults).
      "projectId": "A String", # [Required] The ID of the project containing this job.
      "jobId": "A String", # [Required] The ID of the job. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-). The maximum length is 1,024 characters.

    "totalBytesProcessed": "A String", # The total number of bytes processed for this query. If this query was a dry run, this is the number of bytes that would be processed if the query were run.
    "cacheHit": True or False, # Whether the query result was fetched from the query cache.
    "rows": [ # An object with as many results as can be contained within the maximum permitted reply size. To get any additional rows, you can call GetQueryResults and specify the jobReference returned above.
      {
        "f": [ # Represents a single row in the result set, consisting of one or more fields.
          {
            "v": "",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
    "numDmlAffectedRows": "A String", # [Output-only, Experimental] The number of rows affected by a DML statement. Present only for DML statements INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE.
    "schema": { # The schema of the results. Present only when the query completes successfully.
      "fields": [ # Describes the fields in a table.
        {
          "fields": [ # [Optional] Describes the nested schema fields if the type property is set to RECORD.
            # Object with schema name: TableFieldSchema
          ],
          "type": "A String", # [Required] The field data type.
