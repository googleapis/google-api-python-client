        &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # [Optional] Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored.

BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
        &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. The separator can be any ISO-8859-1 single-byte character. To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (&#x27;,&#x27;).
        &quot;hivePartitioningOptions&quot;: { # [Optional] Options to configure hive partitioning support.
          &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. The following modes are supported. (1) AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). (2) STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are interpreted as strings. (3) CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.
          &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with requirePartitionFilter explicitly set to true will fail.
          &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-01-01/country=BR/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2018-12-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/ (trailing slash does not matter).
        },
        &quot;ignoreUnknownValues&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names
        &quot;jsonExtension&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] If sourceFormat is set to newline-delimited JSON, indicates whether it should be processed as a JSON variant such as GeoJSON. For a sourceFormat other than JSON, omit this field. If the sourceFormat is newline-delimited JSON: - for newline-delimited GeoJSON: set to GEOJSON.
        &quot;maxBadRecords&quot;: 42, # [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV and JSON. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
        &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
        &quot;parquetOptions&quot;: { # [Optional] Options to configure parquet support.
          &quot;enableListInference&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] Indicates whether to use schema inference specifically for Parquet LIST logical type.

        &quot;projectionFields&quot;: [ # If sourceFormat is set to &quot;DATASTORE_BACKUP&quot;, indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup. Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties.

        ],
        &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
        &quot;rangePartitioning&quot;: { # [TrustedTester] Range partitioning specification for this table. Only one of timePartitioning and rangePartitioning should be specified.
          &quot;field&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [TrustedTester] [Required] The table is partitioned by this field. The field must be a top-level NULLABLE/REQUIRED field. The only supported type is INTEGER/INT64.

This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

            &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # [Optional] Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;].

If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV and JSON. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
      &quot;parquetOptions&quot;: { # [Optional] Options to configure parquet support.

If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.
        &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with requirePartitionFilter explicitly set to true will fail.
        &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins.

      &quot;ignoreUnknownValues&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names

            &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
            &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (&#x27;,&#x27;).
            &quot;null_marker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] An custom string that will represent a NULL value in CSV import data.

            &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
            &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

          &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # [Optional] Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.
            &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with requirePartitionFilter explicitly set to true will fail.
            &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-01-01/country=BR/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2018-12-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/ (trailing slash does not matter).

If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored.

If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV and JSON. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.

If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

For a sourceFormat other than JSON, omit this field. If the sourceFormat is newline-delimited JSON: - for newline-delimited GeoJSON: set to GEOJSON.
          &quot;maxBadRecords&quot;: 42, # [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV and JSON. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
          &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.

In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

Setting this flag to a small value such as 1000 and then paging through results might improve reliability when the query result set is large. In addition to this limit, responses are also limited to 10 MB. By default, there is no maximum row count, and only the byte limit applies.
  &quot;maximumBytesBilled&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] Limits the bytes billed for this job. Queries that will have bytes billed beyond this limit will fail (without incurring a charge). If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.

  ],
  &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique user provided identifier to ensure idempotent behavior for queries. Note that this is different from the job_id. It has the following properties: 1. It is case-sensitive, limited to up to 36 ASCII characters. A UUID is recommended. 2. Read only queries can ignore this token since they are nullipotent by definition. 3. For the purposes of idempotency ensured by the request_id, a request is considered duplicate of another only if they have the same request_id and are actually duplicates. When determining whether a request is a duplicate of the previous request, all parameters in the request that may affect the behavior are considered. For example, query, connection_properties, query_parameters, use_legacy_sql are parameters that affect the result and are considered when determining whether a request is a duplicate, but properties like timeout_ms don&#x27;t affect the result and are thus not considered. Dry run query requests are never considered duplicate of another request. 4. When a duplicate mutating query request is detected, it returns: a. the results of the mutation if it completes successfully within the timeout. b. the running operation if it is still in progress at the end of the timeout. 5. Its lifetime is limited to 15 minutes. In other words, if two requests are sent with the same request_id, but more than 15 minutes apart, idempotency is not guaranteed.
  &quot;timeoutMs&quot;: 42, # [Optional] How long to wait for the query to complete, in milliseconds, before the request times out and returns. Note that this is only a timeout for the request, not the query. If the query takes longer to run than the timeout value, the call returns without any results and with the &#x27;jobComplete&#x27; flag set to false. You can call GetQueryResults() to wait for the query to complete and read the results. The default value is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).
  &quot;useLegacySql&quot;: true, # Specifies whether to use BigQuery&#x27;s legacy SQL dialect for this query. The default value is true. If set to false, the query will use BigQuery&#x27;s standard SQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ When useLegacySql is set to false, the value of flattenResults is ignored; query will be run as if flattenResults is false.
  &quot;useQueryCache&quot;: true, # [Optional] Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever tables in the query are modified. The default value is true.
