      },
      &quot;jobTimeoutMs&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Job timeout in milliseconds. If this time limit is exceeded, BigQuery will attempt to stop a longer job, but may not always succeed in canceling it before the job completes. For example, a job that takes more than 60 seconds to complete has a better chance of being stopped than a job that takes 10 seconds to complete.

          ],
        },
        &quot;columnNameCharacterMap&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Character map supported for column names in CSV/Parquet loads. Defaults to STRICT and can be overridden by Project Config Service. Using this option with unsupporting load formats will result in an error.
        &quot;connectionProperties&quot;: [ # Optional. Connection properties which can modify the load job behavior. Currently, only the &#x27;session_id&#x27; connection property is supported, and is used to resolve _SESSION appearing as the dataset id.
          { # A connection-level property to customize query behavior. Under JDBC, these correspond directly to connection properties passed to the DriverManager. Under ODBC, these correspond to properties in the connection string. Currently supported connection properties: * **dataset_project_id**: represents the default project for datasets that are used in the query. Setting the system variable `@@dataset_project_id` achieves the same behavior. For more information about system variables, see: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables * **time_zone**: represents the default timezone used to run the query. * **session_id**: associates the query with a given session. * **query_label**: associates the query with a given job label. If set, all subsequent queries in a script or session will have this label. For the format in which a you can specify a query label, see labels in the JobConfiguration resource type: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#jobconfiguration * **service_account**: indicates the service account to use to run a continuous query. If set, the query job uses the service account to access Google Cloud resources. Service account access is bounded by the IAM permissions that you have granted to the service account. Additional properties are allowed, but ignored. Specifying multiple connection properties with the same key returns an error.
            &quot;key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The key of the property to set.
            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The value of the property to set.
          },
        ],
        &quot;copyFilesOnly&quot;: True or False, # Optional. [Experimental] Configures the load job to copy files directly to the destination BigLake managed table, bypassing file content reading and rewriting. Copying files only is supported when all the following are true: * `source_uris` are located in the same Cloud Storage location as the destination table&#x27;s `storage_uri` location. * `source_format` is `PARQUET`. * `destination_table` is an existing BigLake managed table. The table&#x27;s schema does not have flexible column names. The table&#x27;s columns do not have type parameters other than precision and scale. * No options other than the above are specified.
        &quot;createDisposition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: * CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. * CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a &#x27;notFound&#x27; error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
        &quot;createSession&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If this property is true, the job creates a new session using a randomly generated session_id. To continue using a created session with subsequent queries, pass the existing session identifier as a `ConnectionProperty` value. The session identifier is returned as part of the `SessionInfo` message within the query statistics. The new session&#x27;s location will be set to `Job.JobReference.location` if it is present, otherwise it&#x27;s set to the default location based on existing routing logic.
        &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the `quote` and `fieldDelimiter` properties. If you don&#x27;t specify an encoding, or if you specify a UTF-8 encoding when the CSV file is not UTF-8 encoded, BigQuery attempts to convert the data to UTF-8. Generally, your data loads successfully, but it may not match byte-for-byte what you expect. To avoid this, specify the correct encoding by using the `--encoding` flag. If BigQuery can&#x27;t convert a character other than the ASCII `0` character, BigQuery converts the character to the standard Unicode replacement character: �.
        &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
        &quot;fileSetSpecType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for constructing the file set to load. By default, source URIs are expanded against the underlying storage. You can also specify manifest files to control how the file set is constructed. This option is only applicable to object storage systems.
        &quot;hivePartitioningOptions&quot;: { # Options for configuring hive partitioning detect. # Optional. When set, configures hive partitioning support.

          &quot;fields&quot;: [ # Output only. For permanent external tables, this field is populated with the hive partition keys in the order they were inferred. The types of the partition keys can be deduced by checking the table schema (which will include the partition keys). Not every API will populate this field in the output.

            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data.

Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
          &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names in the table schema Avro, Parquet, ORC: Fields in the file schema that don&#x27;t exist in the table schema.
        &quot;jsonExtension&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Load option to be used together with source_format newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of JSON is being loaded.

        &quot;maxBadRecords&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This is only supported for CSV and NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON file formats.
        &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.

BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;. @default &quot;

This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

              &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
              &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.

              &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.

This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N.

If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;].

This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC.

For more information about system variables, see: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables * **time_zone**: represents the default timezone used to run the query. * **session_id**: associates the query with a given session. * **query_label**: associates the query with a given job label. If set, all subsequent queries in a script or session will have this label. For the format in which a you can specify a query label, see labels in the JobConfiguration resource type: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#jobconfiguration * **service_account**: indicates the service account to use to run a continuous query. If set, the query job uses the service account to access Google Cloud resources. Service account access is bounded by the IAM permissions that you have granted to the service account. Additional properties are allowed, but ignored. Specifying multiple connection properties with the same key returns an error.

      ],
      &quot;copyFilesOnly&quot;: True or False, # Optional. [Experimental] Configures the load job to copy files directly to the destination BigLake managed table, bypassing file content reading and rewriting. Copying files only is supported when all the following are true: * `source_uris` are located in the same Cloud Storage location as the destination table&#x27;s `storage_uri` location. * `source_format` is `PARQUET`. * `destination_table` is an existing BigLake managed table. The table&#x27;s schema does not have flexible column names. The table&#x27;s columns do not have type parameters other than precision and scale. * No options other than the above are specified.
      &quot;createDisposition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: * CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. * CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a &#x27;notFound&#x27; error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
      &quot;createSession&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If this property is true, the job creates a new session using a randomly generated session_id. To continue using a created session with subsequent queries, pass the existing session identifier as a `ConnectionProperty` value. The session identifier is returned as part of the `SessionInfo` message within the query statistics. The new session&#x27;s location will be set to `Job.JobReference.location` if it is present, otherwise it&#x27;s set to the default location based on existing routing logic.
      &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the `quote` and `fieldDelimiter` properties. If you don&#x27;t specify an encoding, or if you specify a UTF-8 encoding when the CSV file is not UTF-8 encoded, BigQuery attempts to convert the data to UTF-8. Generally, your data loads successfully, but it may not match byte-for-byte what you expect. To avoid this, specify the correct encoding by using the `--encoding` flag. If BigQuery can&#x27;t convert a character other than the ASCII `0` character, BigQuery converts the character to the standard Unicode replacement character: �.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;fileSetSpecType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for constructing the file set to load. By default, source URIs are expanded against the underlying storage. You can also specify manifest files to control how the file set is constructed. This option is only applicable to object storage systems.
      &quot;hivePartitioningOptions&quot;: { # Options for configuring hive partitioning detect. # Optional. When set, configures hive partitioning support.

        ],
        &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. The following modes are supported: * AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). * STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.
        &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: false, # Optional. If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
        &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.
      },
      &quot;ignoreUnknownValues&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names in the table schema Avro, Parquet, ORC: Fields in the file schema that don&#x27;t exist in the table schema.
      &quot;jsonExtension&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Load option to be used together with source_format newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of JSON is being loaded. To load newline-delimited GeoJSON, specify GEOJSON (and source_format must be set to NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON).
      &quot;maxBadRecords&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This is only supported for CSV and NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON file formats.
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.

      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;. @default &quot;

When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N.

Currently supported connection properties: * **dataset_project_id**: represents the default project for datasets that are used in the query. Setting the system variable `@@dataset_project_id` achieves the same behavior. For more information about system variables, see: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables * **time_zone**: represents the default timezone used to run the query. * **session_id**: associates the query with a given session. * **query_label**: associates the query with a given job label. If set, all subsequent queries in a script or session will have this label. For the format in which a you can specify a query label, see labels in the JobConfiguration resource type: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#jobconfiguration * **service_account**: indicates the service account to use to run a continuous query.

The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
            &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
            &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
            &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
            &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
            &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC.

            &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.

Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
            &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

  <pre>RPC to get the results of a query job.

Args:
  projectId: string, Required. Project ID of the query job. (required)
  jobId: string, Required. Job ID of the query job. (required)
  formatOptions_useInt64Timestamp: boolean, Optional. Output timestamp as usec int64. Default is false.
  location: string, The geographic location of the job. You must specify the location to run the job for the following scenarios: - If the location to run a job is not in the `us` or the `eu` multi-regional location - If the job&#x27;s location is in a single region (for example, `us-central1`) For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#specifying_your_location.
  maxResults: integer, Maximum number of results to read.
  pageToken: string, Page token, returned by a previous call, to request the next page of results.
  startIndex: string, Zero-based index of the starting row.
  timeoutMs: integer, Optional: Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client is willing to wait for the query to complete. By default, this limit is 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds). If the query is complete, the jobComplete field in the response is true. If the query has not yet completed, jobComplete is false. You can request a longer timeout period in the timeoutMs field. However, the call is not guaranteed to wait for the specified timeout; it typically returns after around 200 seconds (200,000 milliseconds), even if the query is not complete. If jobComplete is false, you can continue to wait for the query to complete by calling the getQueryResults method until the jobComplete field in the getQueryResults response is true.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

        { # A connection-level property to customize query behavior. Under JDBC, these correspond directly to connection properties passed to the DriverManager. Under ODBC, these correspond to properties in the connection string. Currently supported connection properties: * **dataset_project_id**: represents the default project for datasets that are used in the query. Setting the system variable `@@dataset_project_id` achieves the same behavior. For more information about system variables, see: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables * **time_zone**: represents the default timezone used to run the query. * **session_id**: associates the query with a given session. * **query_label**: associates the query with a given job label. If set, all subsequent queries in a script or session will have this label. For the format in which a you can specify a query label, see labels in the JobConfiguration resource type: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#jobconfiguration * **service_account**: indicates the service account to use to run a continuous query. If set, the query job uses the service account to access Google Cloud resources. Service account access is bounded by the IAM permissions that you have granted to the service account. Additional properties are allowed, but ignored. Specifying multiple connection properties with the same key returns an error.

Copying files only is supported when all the following are true: * `source_uris` are located in the same Cloud Storage location as the destination table&#x27;s `storage_uri` location. * `source_format` is `PARQUET`. * `destination_table` is an existing BigLake managed table. The table&#x27;s schema does not have flexible column names. The table&#x27;s columns do not have type parameters other than precision and scale. * No options other than the above are specified.
      &quot;createDisposition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: * CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. * CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a &#x27;notFound&#x27; error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
      &quot;createSession&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If this property is true, the job creates a new session using a randomly generated session_id. To continue using a created session with subsequent queries, pass the existing session identifier as a `ConnectionProperty` value. The session identifier is returned as part of the `SessionInfo` message within the query statistics. The new session&#x27;s location will be set to `Job.JobReference.location` if it is present, otherwise it&#x27;s set to the default location based on existing routing logic.
      &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the `quote` and `fieldDelimiter` properties. If you don&#x27;t specify an encoding, or if you specify a UTF-8 encoding when the CSV file is not UTF-8 encoded, BigQuery attempts to convert the data to UTF-8. Generally, your data loads successfully, but it may not match byte-for-byte what you expect. To avoid this, specify the correct encoding by using the `--encoding` flag. If BigQuery can&#x27;t convert a character other than the ASCII `0` character, BigQuery converts the character to the standard Unicode replacement character: �.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;fileSetSpecType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for constructing the file set to load. By default, source URIs are expanded against the underlying storage. You can also specify manifest files to control how the file set is constructed. This option is only applicable to object storage systems.
      &quot;hivePartitioningOptions&quot;: { # Options for configuring hive partitioning detect. # Optional. When set, configures hive partitioning support.

        ],
        &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. The following modes are supported: * AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). * STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.
        &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: false, # Optional. If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
        &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.
      },
      &quot;ignoreUnknownValues&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names in the table schema Avro, Parquet, ORC: Fields in the file schema that don&#x27;t exist in the table schema.
      &quot;jsonExtension&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Load option to be used together with source_format newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of JSON is being loaded. To load newline-delimited GeoJSON, specify GEOJSON (and source_format must be set to NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON).
      &quot;maxBadRecords&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This is only supported for CSV and NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON file formats.
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.

      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;. @default &quot;

            &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
            &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
            &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
            &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.

This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC.

CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

      &quot;connectionProperties&quot;: [ # Optional. Connection properties which can modify the load job behavior. Currently, only the &#x27;session_id&#x27; connection property is supported, and is used to resolve _SESSION appearing as the dataset id.
        { # A connection-level property to customize query behavior. Under JDBC, these correspond directly to connection properties passed to the DriverManager. Under ODBC, these correspond to properties in the connection string. Currently supported connection properties: * **dataset_project_id**: represents the default project for datasets that are used in the query. Setting the system variable `@@dataset_project_id` achieves the same behavior. For more information about system variables, see: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables * **time_zone**: represents the default timezone used to run the query. * **session_id**: associates the query with a given session. * **query_label**: associates the query with a given job label. If set, all subsequent queries in a script or session will have this label. For the format in which a you can specify a query label, see labels in the JobConfiguration resource type: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#jobconfiguration * **service_account**: indicates the service account to use to run a continuous query. If set, the query job uses the service account to access Google Cloud resources. Service account access is bounded by the IAM permissions that you have granted to the service account. Additional properties are allowed, but ignored. Specifying multiple connection properties with the same key returns an error.

      &quot;copyFilesOnly&quot;: True or False, # Optional. [Experimental] Configures the load job to copy files directly to the destination BigLake managed table, bypassing file content reading and rewriting. Copying files only is supported when all the following are true: * `source_uris` are located in the same Cloud Storage location as the destination table&#x27;s `storage_uri` location. * `source_format` is `PARQUET`. * `destination_table` is an existing BigLake managed table. The table&#x27;s schema does not have flexible column names. The table&#x27;s columns do not have type parameters other than precision and scale. * No options other than the above are specified.
      &quot;createDisposition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: * CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. * CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a &#x27;notFound&#x27; error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
      &quot;createSession&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If this property is true, the job creates a new session using a randomly generated session_id. To continue using a created session with subsequent queries, pass the existing session identifier as a `ConnectionProperty` value. The session identifier is returned as part of the `SessionInfo` message within the query statistics. The new session&#x27;s location will be set to `Job.JobReference.location` if it is present, otherwise it&#x27;s set to the default location based on existing routing logic.
      &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the `quote` and `fieldDelimiter` properties. If you don&#x27;t specify an encoding, or if you specify a UTF-8 encoding when the CSV file is not UTF-8 encoded, BigQuery attempts to convert the data to UTF-8. Generally, your data loads successfully, but it may not match byte-for-byte what you expect. To avoid this, specify the correct encoding by using the `--encoding` flag. If BigQuery can&#x27;t convert a character other than the ASCII `0` character, BigQuery converts the character to the standard Unicode replacement character: �.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;fileSetSpecType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for constructing the file set to load. By default, source URIs are expanded against the underlying storage. You can also specify manifest files to control how the file set is constructed. This option is only applicable to object storage systems.
      &quot;hivePartitioningOptions&quot;: { # Options for configuring hive partitioning detect. # Optional. When set, configures hive partitioning support.

          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. The following modes are supported: * AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). * STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.
        &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: false, # Optional. If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
        &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.
      },
      &quot;ignoreUnknownValues&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names in the table schema Avro, Parquet, ORC: Fields in the file schema that don&#x27;t exist in the table schema.
      &quot;jsonExtension&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Load option to be used together with source_format newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of JSON is being loaded. To load newline-delimited GeoJSON, specify GEOJSON (and source_format must be set to NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON).
      &quot;maxBadRecords&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This is only supported for CSV and NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON file formats.
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.

      ],
      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;. @default &quot;

The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
            &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
            &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
            &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
            &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
            &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

Under ODBC, these correspond to properties in the connection string. Currently supported connection properties: * **dataset_project_id**: represents the default project for datasets that are used in the query. Setting the system variable `@@dataset_project_id` achieves the same behavior. For more information about system variables, see: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables * **time_zone**: represents the default timezone used to run the query. * **session_id**: associates the query with a given session. * **query_label**: associates the query with a given job label. If set, all subsequent queries in a script or session will have this label. For the format in which a you can specify a query label, see labels in the JobConfiguration resource type: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#jobconfiguration * **service_account**: indicates the service account to use to run a continuous query. If set, the query job uses the service account to access Google Cloud resources. Service account access is bounded by the IAM permissions that you have granted to the service account. Additional properties are allowed, but ignored. Specifying multiple connection properties with the same key returns an error.

The table&#x27;s schema does not have flexible column names. The table&#x27;s columns do not have type parameters other than precision and scale. * No options other than the above are specified.
          &quot;createDisposition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: * CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. * CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a &#x27;notFound&#x27; error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
          &quot;createSession&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If this property is true, the job creates a new session using a randomly generated session_id. To continue using a created session with subsequent queries, pass the existing session identifier as a `ConnectionProperty` value. The session identifier is returned as part of the `SessionInfo` message within the query statistics. The new session&#x27;s location will be set to `Job.JobReference.location` if it is present, otherwise it&#x27;s set to the default location based on existing routing logic.

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the `quote` and `fieldDelimiter` properties. If you don&#x27;t specify an encoding, or if you specify a UTF-8 encoding when the CSV file is not UTF-8 encoded, BigQuery attempts to convert the data to UTF-8. Generally, your data loads successfully, but it may not match byte-for-byte what you expect. To avoid this, specify the correct encoding by using the `--encoding` flag. If BigQuery can&#x27;t convert a character other than the ASCII `0` character, BigQuery converts the character to the standard Unicode replacement character: �.
          &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).

The following modes are supported: * AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). * STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.

Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
            &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names in the table schema Avro, Parquet, ORC: Fields in the file schema that don&#x27;t exist in the table schema.

If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This is only supported for CSV and NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON file formats.

For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE.

The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character.

The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
                &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
                &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
                &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
                &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
                &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

For the format in which a you can specify a query label, see labels in the JobConfiguration resource type: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#jobconfiguration * **service_account**: indicates the service account to use to run a continuous query. If set, the query job uses the service account to access Google Cloud resources. Service account access is bounded by the IAM permissions that you have granted to the service account. Additional properties are allowed, but ignored. Specifying multiple connection properties with the same key returns an error.

For example, query, connection_properties, query_parameters, use_legacy_sql are parameters that affect the result and are considered when determining whether a request is a duplicate, but properties like timeout_ms don&#x27;t affect the result and are thus not considered. Dry run query requests are never considered duplicate of another request. 4. When a duplicate mutating query request is detected, it returns: a. the results of the mutation if it completes successfully within the timeout. b. the running operation if it is still in progress at the end of the timeout. 5. Its lifetime is limited to 15 minutes. In other words, if two requests are sent with the same request_id, but more than 15 minutes apart, idempotency is not guaranteed.
  &quot;timeoutMs&quot;: 42, # Optional. Optional: Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client is willing to wait for the query to complete. By default, this limit is 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds). If the query is complete, the jobComplete field in the response is true. If the query has not yet completed, jobComplete is false. You can request a longer timeout period in the timeoutMs field. However, the call is not guaranteed to wait for the specified timeout; it typically returns after around 200 seconds (200,000 milliseconds), even if the query is not complete. If jobComplete is false, you can continue to wait for the query to complete by calling the getQueryResults method until the jobComplete field in the getQueryResults response is true.
  &quot;useLegacySql&quot;: true, # Specifies whether to use BigQuery&#x27;s legacy SQL dialect for this query. The default value is true. If set to false, the query will use BigQuery&#x27;s GoogleSQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ When useLegacySql is set to false, the value of flattenResults is ignored; query will be run as if flattenResults is false.
  &quot;useQueryCache&quot;: true, # Optional. Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever tables in the query are modified. The default value is true.
