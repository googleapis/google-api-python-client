  <pre>Requests that a job be cancelled. This call will return immediately, and the client will need to poll for the job status to see if the cancel completed successfully. Cancelled jobs may still incur costs.

Args:
  projectId: string, [Required] Project ID of the job to cancel (required)
  jobId: string, [Required] Job ID of the job to cancel (required)
  location: string, The geographic location of the job. Required except for US and EU. See details at https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#specifying_your_location.

Returns:

Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N.

If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets.

BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.

This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values.

            &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (&#x27;,&#x27;).
            &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8.

        &quot;tableDefinitions&quot;: { # [Optional] If querying an external data source outside of BigQuery, describes the data format, location and other properties of the data source. By defining these properties, the data source can then be queried as if it were a standard BigQuery table.

If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets.

BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.

This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values.

              &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.

              &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8.

This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values.

BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.

If set to false, the query will use BigQuery&#x27;s standard SQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ When useLegacySql is set to false, the value of flattenResults is ignored; query will be run as if flattenResults is false.
