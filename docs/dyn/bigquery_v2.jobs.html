          "fieldDelimiter": "A String", # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.

          "schemaInline": "A String", # [Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as "Field1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]*". For example, "foo:STRING, bar:INTEGER, baz:FLOAT".

BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.

The following values are supported: WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table. WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table. WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
            "maxBadRecords": 42, # [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job.

If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
            "createDisposition": "A String", # [Optional] Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported: CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.

            "schemaInline": "A String", # [Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as "Field1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]*". For example, "foo:STRING, bar:INTEGER, baz:FLOAT".

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list_next">list_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="query">query(projectId, body)</code>
  <pre>Runs a BigQuery SQL query synchronously and returns query results if the query completes within a specified timeout.

Args:
  projectId: string, Project ID of the project billed for the query (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

    "kind": "bigquery#queryRequest", # The resource type of the request.
    "dryRun": True or False, # [Optional] If set, don't actually run the query. A valid query will return an empty response, while an invalid query will return the same error it would if it wasn't a dry run.
    "defaultDataset": { # [Optional] Specifies the default datasetId and projectId to assume for any unqualified table names in the query. If not set, all table names in the query string must be fully-qualified in the format projectId:datasetId.tableid.

      "datasetId": "A String", # [Required] A unique ID for this dataset, without the project name.
    },
    "maxResults": 42, # [Optional] The maximum number of results to return per page of results. If the response list exceeds the maximum response size for a single response, you will have to page through the results. Default is to return the maximum response size.
    "query": "A String", # [Required] A query string, following the BigQuery query syntax of the query to execute. Table names should be qualified by dataset name in the format projectId:datasetId.tableId unless you specify the defaultDataset value. If the table is in the same project as the job, you can omit the project ID. Example: SELECT f1 FROM myProjectId:myDatasetId.myTableId.
    "preserveNulls": True or False, # [Experimental] If set, preserve null values in table data, rather than mapping null values to the column's default value. This flag currently defaults to false, but the default will soon be changed to true. Shortly afterward, this flag will be removed completely. Please specify true if possible, and false only if you need to force the old behavior while updating client code.

    "totalRows": "A String", # The total number of rows in the complete query result set, which can be more than the number of rows in this single page of results.
    "schema": { # The schema of the results. Present only when the query completes successfully.
