Returns:

    { # An instance of an analysis type that has been found on a resource.
  &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the authority to which this attestation is attached is primarily useful for lookup (how to find this attestation if you already know the authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (for which authority this attestation was intended to sign. # Describes an attestation of an artifact.
    &quot;jwts&quot;: [ # One or more JWTs encoding a self-contained attestation. Each JWT encodes the payload that it verifies within the JWT itself. Verifier implementation SHOULD ignore the `serialized_payload` field when verifying these JWTs. If only JWTs are present on this AttestationOccurrence, then the `serialized_payload` SHOULD be left empty. Each JWT SHOULD encode a claim specific to the `resource_uri` of this Occurrence, but this is not validated by Grafeas metadata API implementations. The JWT itself is opaque to Grafeas.

    &quot;serializedPayload&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The serialized payload that is verified by one or more `signatures`.
    &quot;signatures&quot;: [ # One or more signatures over `serialized_payload`. Verifier implementations should consider this attestation message verified if at least one `signature` verifies `serialized_payload`. See `Signature` in common.proto for more details on signature structure and verification.
      { # Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy). Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be &quot;attached&quot; (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any &quot;attached&quot; payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).
        &quot;publicKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The identifier for the public key that verifies this signature. * The `public_key_id` is required. * The `public_key_id` SHOULD be an RFC3986 conformant URI. * When possible, the `public_key_id` SHOULD be an immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest. Examples of valid `public_key_id`s: OpenPGP V4 public key fingerprint: * &quot;openpgp4fpr:74FAF3B861BDA0870C7B6DEF607E48D2A663AEEA&quot; See https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/openpgp4fpr for more details on this scheme.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getNotes">getNotes(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the note attached to the specified occurrence. Consumer projects can use this method to get a note that belongs to a provider project.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the occurrence in the form of `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/occurrences/[OCCURRENCE_ID]`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
