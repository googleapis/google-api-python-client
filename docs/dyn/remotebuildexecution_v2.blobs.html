  <pre>Download many blobs at once.

The server may enforce a limit of the combined total size of blobs
to be downloaded using this API. This limit may be obtained using the
Capabilities API.
Requests exceeding the limit should either be split into smaller
chunks or downloaded using the
ByteStream API, as appropriate.

This request is equivalent to calling a Bytestream `Read` request
on each individual blob, in parallel. The requests may succeed or fail
independently.

Errors:

* `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: The client attempted to read more than the
  server supported limit.

Every error on individual read will be returned in the corresponding digest
status.

Args:
  instanceName: string, The instance of the execution system to operate against. A server may
support multiple instances of the execution system (with their own workers,
storage, caches, etc.). The server MAY require use of this field to select
between them in an implementation-defined fashion, otherwise it can be
omitted. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request message for
      # ContentAddressableStorage.BatchReadBlobs.
    "digests": [ # The individual blob digests.
      { # A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob
          # and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server, but servers
          # SHOULD use SHA-256.
          #
          # The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be
          # separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but
          # `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request.
          #
          # The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great
          # many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work
          # with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree
          # structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could
          # implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more
          # complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size
          # up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where
          # digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation
          # details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but
          # we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff.
          #
          # When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the

          # * There are no duplicate fields.
          # * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type.

  <pre>Upload many blobs at once.

The server may enforce a limit of the combined total size of blobs
to be uploaded using this API. This limit may be obtained using the
Capabilities API.
Requests exceeding the limit should either be split into smaller

Errors:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getTree">getTree(instanceName, hash, sizeBytes, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Fetch the entire directory tree rooted at a node.

This request must be targeted at a
Directory stored in the
ContentAddressableStorage
(CAS). The server will enumerate the `Directory` tree recursively and
return every node descended from the root.

The GetTreeRequest.page_token parameter can be used to skip ahead in
the stream (e.g. when retrying a partially completed and aborted request),
by setting it to a value taken from GetTreeResponse.next_page_token of the
last successfully processed GetTreeResponse).

The exact traversal order is unspecified and, unless retrieving subsequent
pages from an earlier request, is not guaranteed to be stable across
multiple invocations of `GetTree`.

If part of the tree is missing from the CAS, the server will return the
portion present and omit the rest.

* `NOT_FOUND`: The requested tree root is not present in the CAS.

Args:
  instanceName: string, The instance of the execution system to operate against. A server may
support multiple instances of the execution system (with their own workers,
storage, caches, etc.). The server MAY require use of this field to select
between them in an implementation-defined fashion, otherwise it can be
omitted. (required)
  hash: string, The hash. In the case of SHA-256, it will always be a lowercase hex string
exactly 64 characters long. (required)
  sizeBytes: string, The size of the blob, in bytes. (required)
  pageSize: integer, A maximum page size to request. If present, the server will request no more
than this many items. Regardless of whether a page size is specified, the
server may place its own limit on the number of items to be returned and
require the client to retrieve more items using a subsequent request.
  pageToken: string, A page token, which must be a value received in a previous
GetTreeResponse.
If present, the server will use it to return the following page of results.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A response message for
      # ContentAddressableStorage.GetTree.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # If present, signifies that there are more results which the client can
        # retrieve by passing this as the page_token in a subsequent
        # request.
        # If empty, signifies that this is the last page of results.
    "directories": [ # The directories descended from the requested root.
      { # A `Directory` represents a directory node in a file tree, containing zero or
          # more children FileNodes,

          # SymlinkNodes.
          # Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its
          # content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as
          # well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory.
          #
          # In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same
          # value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a
          # a `Directory`:
          #
          # * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment.
          #   Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed.
          # * Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name).
          #   Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where
          #   the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is
          #   legal to call the API with a Directory that has both "Foo" and "foo" as
          #   children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon
          #   execution.
          # * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted
          #   in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code
          #   point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes.
          #
          # A `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form.
          #
          # As an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a
