  <pre>Download many blobs at once. The server may enforce a limit of the combined total size of blobs to be downloaded using this API. This limit may be obtained using the Capabilities API.

This request is equivalent to calling a Bytestream `Read` request on each individual blob, in parallel. The requests may succeed or fail independently. Errors: * `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: The client attempted to read more than the server supported limit. Every error on individual read will be returned in the corresponding digest status.

Args:
  instanceName: string, The instance of the execution system to operate against. A server may support multiple instances of the execution system (with their own workers, storage, caches, etc.). The server MAY require use of this field to select between them in an implementation-defined fashion, otherwise it can be omitted. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request message for ContentAddressableStorage.BatchReadBlobs.
  &quot;digests&quot;: [ # The individual blob digests.
    { # A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server. The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request. The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff. When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message: * Fields are serialized in tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type. Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance, concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields.

Each `Node` contains its name in the directory, either the digest of its content (either a file blob or a `Directory` proto) or a symlink target, as well as possibly some metadata about the file or directory. In order to ensure that two equivalent directory trees hash to the same value, the following restrictions MUST be obeyed when constructing a a `Directory`: * Every child in the directory must have a path of exactly one segment. Multiple levels of directory hierarchy may not be collapsed. * Each child in the directory must have a unique path segment (file name). Note that while the API itself is case-sensitive, the environment where the Action is executed may or may not be case-sensitive. That is, it is legal to call the API with a Directory that has both &quot;Foo&quot; and &quot;foo&quot; as children, but the Action may be rejected by the remote system upon execution. * The files, directories and symlinks in the directory must each be sorted in lexicographical order by path. The path strings must be sorted by code point, equivalently, by UTF-8 bytes. * The NodeProperties of files, directories, and symlinks must be sorted in lexicographical order by property name. A `Directory` that obeys the restrictions is said to be in canonical form. As an example, the following could be used for a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz` (hashes shortened for readability): ```json // (Directory proto) { files: [ { name: &quot;bar&quot;, digest: { hash: &quot;4a73bc9d03...&quot;, size: 65534 }, node_properties: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MTime&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z&quot; } ] } ], directories: [ { name: &quot;foo&quot;, digest: { hash: &quot;4cf2eda940...&quot;, size: 43 } } ] } // (Directory proto with hash &quot;4cf2eda940...&quot; and size 43) { files: [ { name: &quot;baz&quot;, digest: { hash: &quot;b2c941073e...&quot;, size: 1294, }, is_executable: true } ] } ```

          &quot;digest&quot;: { # A content digest. A digest for a given blob consists of the size of the blob and its hash. The hash algorithm to use is defined by the server. The size is considered to be an integral part of the digest and cannot be separated. That is, even if the `hash` field is correctly specified but `size_bytes` is not, the server MUST reject the request. The reason for including the size in the digest is as follows: in a great many cases, the server needs to know the size of the blob it is about to work with prior to starting an operation with it, such as flattening Merkle tree structures or streaming it to a worker. Technically, the server could implement a separate metadata store, but this results in a significantly more complicated implementation as opposed to having the client specify the size up-front (or storing the size along with the digest in every message where digests are embedded). This does mean that the API leaks some implementation details of (what we consider to be) a reasonable server implementation, but we consider this to be a worthwhile tradeoff. When a `Digest` is used to refer to a proto message, it always refers to the message in binary encoded form. To ensure consistent hashing, clients and servers MUST ensure that they serialize messages according to the following rules, even if there are alternate valid encodings for the same message: * Fields are serialized in tag order. * There are no unknown fields. * There are no duplicate fields. * Fields are serialized according to the default semantics for their type. Most protocol buffer implementations will always follow these rules when serializing, but care should be taken to avoid shortcuts. For instance, concatenating two messages to merge them may produce duplicate fields. # The digest of the file&#x27;s content.
