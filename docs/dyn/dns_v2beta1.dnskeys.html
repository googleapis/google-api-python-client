<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(project, managedZone, dnsKeyId, digestType=None, clientOperationId=None)</code>
  <pre>Fetch the representation of an existing DnsKey.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)
  managedZone: string, Identifies the managed zone addressed by this request. Can be the managed zone name or id. (required)
  dnsKeyId: string, The identifier of the requested DnsKey. (required)
  digestType: string, An optional comma-separated list of digest types to compute and display for key signing keys. If omitted, the recommended digest type will be computed and displayed.
  clientOperationId: string, For mutating operation requests only. An optional identifier specified by the client. Must be unique for operation resources in the Operations collection.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A DNSSEC key pair.
    "keyTag": 42, # The key tag is a non-cryptographic hash of the a DNSKEY resource record associated with this DnsKey. The key tag can be used to identify a DNSKEY more quickly (but it is not a unique identifier). In particular, the key tag is used in a parent zone's DS record to point at the DNSKEY in this child ManagedZone. The key tag is a number in the range [0, 65535] and the algorithm to calculate it is specified in RFC4034 Appendix B. Output only.
    "kind": "dns#dnsKey", # Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "dns#dnsKey".
    "description": "A String", # A mutable string of at most 1024 characters associated with this resource for the user's convenience. Has no effect on the resource's function.
    "algorithm": "A String", # String mnemonic specifying the DNSSEC algorithm of this key. Immutable after creation time.
    "keyLength": 42, # Length of the key in bits. Specified at creation time then immutable.
    "creationTime": "A String", # The time that this resource was created in the control plane. This is in RFC3339 text format. Output only.
    "publicKey": "A String", # Base64 encoded public half of this key. Output only.
    "type": "A String", # One of "KEY_SIGNING" or "ZONE_SIGNING". Keys of type KEY_SIGNING have the Secure Entry Point flag set and, when active, will be used to sign only resource record sets of type DNSKEY. Otherwise, the Secure Entry Point flag will be cleared and this key will be used to sign only resource record sets of other types. Immutable after creation time.
    "digests": [ # Cryptographic hashes of the DNSKEY resource record associated with this DnsKey. These digests are needed to construct a DS record that points at this DNS key. Output only.
      {
        "type": "A String", # Specifies the algorithm used to calculate this digest.
        "digest": "A String", # The base-16 encoded bytes of this digest. Suitable for use in a DS resource record.

  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, managedZone, pageToken=None, digestType=None, maxResults=None)</code>
  <pre>Enumerate DnsKeys to a ResourceRecordSet collection.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)
  managedZone: string, Identifies the managed zone addressed by this request. Can be the managed zone name or id. (required)
  pageToken: string, Optional. A tag returned by a previous list request that was truncated. Use this parameter to continue a previous list request.
  digestType: string, An optional comma-separated list of digest types to compute and display for key signing keys. If omitted, the recommended digest type will be computed and displayed.
  maxResults: integer, Optional. Maximum number of results to be returned. If unspecified, the server will decide how many results to return.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response to a request to enumerate DnsKeys in a ManagedZone.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # The presence of this field indicates that there exist more results following your last page of results in pagination order. To fetch them, make another list request using this value as your pagination token.
        #
        # In this way you can retrieve the complete contents of even very large collections one page at a time. However, if the contents of the collection change between the first and last paginated list request, the set of all elements returned will be an inconsistent view of the collection. There is no way to retrieve a "snapshot" of collections larger than the maximum page size.
    "header": { # Elements common to every response.

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
