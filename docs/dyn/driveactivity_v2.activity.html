    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for querying Drive activity.
    "pageSize": 42, # The requested number of activity to return. If not set, a default value
        # will be used.
    "ancestorName": "A String", # Return activities for this Drive folder and all children and descendants.
        # The format is "items/ITEM_ID".
    "filter": "A String", # The filtering for items returned from this query request. The format of the
        # filter string is a sequence of expressions, joined by an optional "AND",
        # where each expression is of the form "field operator value".
        # 
        # Supported fields:
        # 
        #   - <tt>time</tt>: Uses numerical operators on date values either in
        #     terms of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 or in RFC 3339 format.
        #     Examples:
        #       - <tt>time > 1452409200000 AND time <= 1492812924310</tt>
        #       - <tt>time >= "2016-01-10T01:02:03-05:00"</tt>
        # 
        #   - <tt>detail.action_detail_case</tt>: Uses the "has" operator (:) and

        #     parentheses.
        #     Examples:

    "pageToken": "A String", # The next_page_token value returned from a previous QueryDriveActivity
        # request, if any.
    "consolidationStrategy": { # How the individual activities are consolidated. A set of activities may be # Details on how to consolidate related actions that make up the activity. If
        # not set, then related actions will not be consolidated.
        # consolidated into one combined activity if they are related in some way, such
        # as one actor performing the same action on multiple targets, or multiple
        # actors performing the same action on a single target. The strategy defines
        # the rules for which activities are related.
      "none": { # A strategy which does no consolidation of individual activities. # The individual activities are not consolidated.
      },
      "legacy": { # A strategy which consolidates activities using the grouping rules from the # The individual activities are consolidated using the legacy strategy.
          # legacy V1 Activity API. Similar actions occurring within a window of time
