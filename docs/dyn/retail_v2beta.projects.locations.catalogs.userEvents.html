  <pre>Writes a single user event from the browser. This uses a GET request to due to browser restriction of POST-ing to a 3rd party domain. This method is used only by the Retail API JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager. Users should not call this method directly.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent catalog name, such as `projects/1234/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog`. (required)
  ets: string, The event timestamp in milliseconds. This prevents browser caching of otherwise identical get requests. The name is abbreviated to reduce the payload bytes.
  prebuiltRule: string, The prebuilt rule name that can convert a specific type of raw_json. For example: &quot;ga4_bq&quot; rule for the GA4 user event schema.
  rawJson: string, An arbitrary serialized JSON string that contains necessary information that can comprise a user event. When this field is specified, the user_event field will be ignored. Note: line-delimited JSON is not supported, a single JSON only.
  uri: string, The URL including cgi-parameters but excluding the hash fragment with a length limit of 5,000 characters. This is often more useful than the referer URL, because many browsers only send the domain for 3rd party requests.
  userEvent: string, Required. URL encoded UserEvent proto with a length limit of 2,000,000 characters.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for payload formats that can&#x27;t be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or an HTML page. This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example: message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id = 1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); } Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.
  &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP Content-Type header value specifying the content type of the body.
  &quot;data&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The HTTP request/response body as raw binary.
  &quot;extensions&quot;: [ # Application specific response metadata. Must be set in the first response for streaming APIs.
    {
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.

If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events, also include them in the user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events provided with prediction requests. This lets the Retail API use those custom attributes when training models and serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality. This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed.

The value must be a valid PredictResponse.attribution_token for user events that are the result of PredictionService.Predict. The value must be a valid SearchResponse.attribution_token for user events that are the result of SearchService.Search. This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or purchase back to the event and the particular predict response containing this clicked/purchased product. If user clicks on product K in the recommendation results, pass PredictResponse.attribution_token as a URL parameter to product K&#x27;s page. When recording events on product K&#x27;s page, log the PredictResponse.attribution_token to this field.

For instance, a special sale page may have the category hierarchy: &quot;pageCategories&quot; : [&quot;Sales &gt; 2017 Black Friday Deals&quot;]. Required for `category-page-view` events. At least one of search_query or page_categories is required for `search` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

For example, an item detail page view could trigger multiple events as the user is browsing the page. The `pageViewId` property should be kept the same for all these events so that they can be grouped together properly. When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in automatically.

This field is optional except for the following event types: * `add-to-cart` * `detail-page-view` * `purchase-complete` In a `search` event, this field represents the products returned to the end user on the current page (the end user may have not finished browsing the whole page yet). When a new page is returned to the end user, after pagination/filtering/ordering even for the same query, a new `search` event with different product_details is desired.

Custom attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events provided with prediction requests. This lets the Retail API use those custom attributes when training models and serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality. This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. For product recommendations, an example of extra user information is traffic_channel, which is how a user arrives at the site. Users can arrive at the site by coming to the site directly, coming through Google search, or in other ways.
