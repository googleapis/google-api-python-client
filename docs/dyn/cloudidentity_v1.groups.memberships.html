<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="checkTransitiveMembership">checkTransitiveMembership(parent, query=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Check a potential member for membership in a group. **Note:** This feature is only available to Google Workspace Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, and Enterprise for Education; and Cloud Identity Premium accounts. If the account of the member is not one of these, a 403 (PERMISSION_DENIED) HTTP status code will be returned. A member has membership to a group as long as there is a single viewable transitive membership between the group and the member. The actor must have view permissions to at least one transitive membership between the member and group.

Args:
  parent: string, [Resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) of the group to check the transitive membership in. Format: `groups/{group_id}`, where `group_id` is the unique id assigned to the Group to which the Membership belongs to. (required)
  query: string, Required. A CEL expression that MUST include member specification. This is a `required` field. Certain groups are uniquely identified by both a &#x27;member_key_id&#x27; and a &#x27;member_key_namespace&#x27;, which requires an additional query input: &#x27;member_key_namespace&#x27;. Example query: `member_key_id == &#x27;member_key_id_value&#x27;`
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response message for MembershipsService.CheckTransitiveMembership.
  &quot;hasMembership&quot;: True or False, # Response does not include the possible roles of a member since the behavior of this rpc is not all-or-nothing unlike the other rpcs. So, it may not be possible to list all the roles definitively, due to possible lack of authorization in some of the paths.
