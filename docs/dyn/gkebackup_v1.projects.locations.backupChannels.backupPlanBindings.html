<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieve the details of a single BackupPlanBinding.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Fully qualified BackupPlanBinding name. Format: `projects/*/locations/*/backupChannels/*/backupPlanBindings/*` (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A BackupPlanBinding binds a BackupPlan with a BackupChannel. This resource is created automatically when a BackupPlan is created using a BackupChannel. This also serves as a holder for cross-project fields that need to be displayed in the current project.

    &quot;lastSuccessfulBackup&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The fully qualified name of the last successful Backup created under this BackupPlan. `projects/*/locations/*/backupPlans/*/backups/*`

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists BackupPlanBindings in a given location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The BackupChannel that contains the BackupPlanBindings to list. Format: `projects/*/locations/*/backupChannels/*` (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Field match expression used to filter the results.
  orderBy: string, Optional. Field by which to sort the results.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The target number of results to return in a single response. If not specified, a default value will be chosen by the service. Note that the response may include a partial list and a caller should only rely on the response&#x27;s next_page_token to determine if there are more instances left to be queried.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The value of next_page_token received from a previous `ListBackupPlanBindings` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page in a multi-page list of results. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListBackupPlanBindings` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
