Example: 5 backups from the same source cluster and type with a quantity-based retention of 3 and denoted by backup_id (position, retention). Safe: backup_5 (1, 3), backup_4, (2, 3), backup_3 (3, 3).

}

  backupId: string, Required. ID of the requesting object.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server ignores the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, the backend validates the request, but doesn&#x27;t actually execute it.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # For Resource freshness validation (https://google.aip.dev/154)
  &quot;expiryQuantity&quot;: { # A backup&#x27;s position in a quantity-based retention queue, of backups with the same source cluster and type, with length, retention, specified by the backup&#x27;s retention policy. Once the position is greater than the retention, the backup is eligible to be garbage collected. Example: 5 backups from the same source cluster and type with a quantity-based retention of 3 and denoted by backup_id (position, retention). Safe: backup_5 (1, 3), backup_4, (2, 3), backup_3 (3, 3). Awaiting garbage collection: backup_2 (4, 3), backup_1 (5, 3) # Output only. The QuantityBasedExpiry of the backup, specified by the backup&#x27;s retention policy. Once the expiry quantity is over retention, the backup is eligible to be garbage collected.
    &quot;retentionCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. The backup&#x27;s position among its backups with the same source cluster and type, by descending chronological order create time(i.e. newest first).

  },
  &quot;expiryTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which after the backup is eligible to be garbage collected. It is the duration specified by the backup&#x27;s retention policy, added to the backup&#x27;s create_time.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the backup resource with the format: * projects/{project}/locations/{region}/backups/{backup_id} where the cluster and backup ID segments should satisfy the regex expression `[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?`, e.g. 1-63 characters of lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes, starting with a letter, and ending with a letter or number. For more details see https://google.aip.dev/122. The prefix of the backup resource name is the name of the parent resource: * projects/{project}/locations/{region}
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Reconciling (https://google.aip.dev/128#reconciliation), if true, indicates that the service is actively updating the resource. This can happen due to user-triggered updates or system actions like failover or maintenance.
  &quot;satisfiesPzs&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Reserved for future use.
  &quot;sizeBytes&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The size of the backup in bytes.

}

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set to true, update succeeds even if instance is not found. In that case, a new backup is created and `update_mask` is ignored.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server ignores the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Backup resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, the backend validates the request, but doesn&#x27;t actually execute it.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
