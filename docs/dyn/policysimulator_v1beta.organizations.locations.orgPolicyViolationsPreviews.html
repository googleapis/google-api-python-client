  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

The list of violations are modeled as child resources and retrieved via a ListOrgPolicyViolations API call. There are potentially more OrgPolicyViolations than could fit in an embedded field. Thus, the use of a child resource instead of a field.

  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  <pre>ListOrgPolicyViolationsPreviews lists each OrgPolicyViolationsPreview in an organization. Each OrgPolicyViolationsPreview is available for at least 7 days.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent the violations are scoped to. Format: `organizations/{organization}/locations/{location}` Example: `organizations/my-example-org/locations/global` (required)
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of items to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 5 items will be returned. The maximum value is 10; values above 10 will be coerced to 10.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token, received from a previous call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
