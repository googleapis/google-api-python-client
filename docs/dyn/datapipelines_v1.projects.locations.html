<div class="method">

  <pre>Lists pipelines. Returns a &quot;FORBIDDEN&quot; error if the caller doesn&#x27;t have permission to access it.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The location name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`. (required)
  filter: string, An expression for filtering the results of the request. If unspecified, all pipelines will be returned. Multiple filters can be applied and must be comma separated. Fields eligible for filtering are: + `type`: The type of the pipeline (streaming or batch). Allowed values are `ALL`, `BATCH`, and `STREAMING`. + `status`: The activity status of the pipeline. Allowed values are `ALL`, `ACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`, and `PAUSED`. For example, to limit results to active batch processing pipelines: type:BATCH,status:ACTIVE
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of entities to return. The service may return fewer than this value, even if there are additional pages. If unspecified, the max limit is yet to be determined by the backend implementation.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListPipelines` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListPipelines` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for ListPipelines.
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A token, which can be sent as `page_token` to retrieve the next page. If this field is omitted, there are no subsequent pages.
  &quot;pipelines&quot;: [ # Results that matched the filter criteria and were accessible to the caller. Results are always in descending order of pipeline creation date.
    { # The main pipeline entity and all the necessary metadata for launching and managing linked jobs.

Must be unique for the selected project and location.
