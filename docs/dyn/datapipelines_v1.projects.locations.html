The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set. Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also would like to store the user&#x27;s timezone, that can be done in another field. This type is more flexible than some applications may want. Make sure to document and validate your application&#x27;s limitations. # A datetime value.

              &quot;minutes&quot;: 42, # Optional. Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59, defaults to 0.
              &quot;month&quot;: 42, # Optional. Month of year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 if specifying a datetime without a month.

Clients may convert values into language-native decimal formats, such as Java&#x27;s BigDecimal or Python&#x27;s decimal.Decimal. [BigDecimal]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html [decimal.Decimal]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html # A large decimal value, equivalent to Java BigDecimal.
              &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (&quot;the integer&quot;), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty string **should** be interpreted as `0`. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -&gt; `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -&gt; `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case, with explicit sign (`2.5e8` -&gt; `2.5E+8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5E0` -&gt; `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5E-1` &lt;-&gt; `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = &#x27;&#x27; | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = &#x27;+&#x27; | &#x27;-&#x27;; Significand = Digits &#x27;.&#x27; | [Digits] &#x27;.&#x27; Digits; Exponent = (&#x27;e&#x27; | &#x27;E&#x27;) [Sign] Digits; Digits = { &#x27;0&#x27; | &#x27;1&#x27; | &#x27;2&#x27; | &#x27;3&#x27; | &#x27;4&#x27; | &#x27;5&#x27; | &#x27;6&#x27; | &#x27;7&#x27; | &#x27;8&#x27; | &#x27;9&#x27; }; Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range.

  filter: string, An expression for filtering the results of the request. If unspecified, all pipelines will be returned. Multiple filters can be applied and must be comma separated. Fields eligible for filtering are: + `type`: The type of the pipeline (streaming or batch). Allowed values are `ALL`, `BATCH`, and `STREAMING`. + `status`: The activity status of the pipeline. Allowed values are `ALL`, `ACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`, and `PAUSED`. For example, to limit results to active batch processing pipelines: type:BATCH,status:ACTIVE
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of entities to return. The service may return fewer than this value, even if there are additional pages. If unspecified, the max limit is yet to be determined by the backend implementation.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListPipelines` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListPipelines` must match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for ListPipelines.
