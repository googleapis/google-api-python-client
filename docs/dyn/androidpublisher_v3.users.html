This can happen if the caller does not have permission to manage all apps in the account. This is also `true` if this user is the account owner. If this field is `true`, it should be taken as a signal that this user cannot be fully managed via the API. That is, the API caller is not be able to manage all of the permissions this user holds, either because it doesn&#x27;t know about them or because the user is the account owner.
