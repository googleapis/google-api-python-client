  <pre>Lists all deployments of a shared flow revision.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Name of the API proxy revision for which to return deployment information in the following format: `organizations/{org}/sharedflows/{sharedflow}/revisions/{rev}`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
