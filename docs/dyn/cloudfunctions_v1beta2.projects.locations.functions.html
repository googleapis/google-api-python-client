When uploading source code to the generated signed URL, please follow
these restrictions:

* Source file size should not exceed 100MB limit.
* No credentials should be attached - the signed URLs provide access to the
  target bucket using internal service identity; if credentials were
  attached, the identity from the credentials would be used, but that
  identity does not have permissions to upload files to the URL.

When making a HTTP PUT request, these two headers need to be specified:

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.

        # available.
    &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is

        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that

        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
        # three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
        #
        # You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
        # [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any

      &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
          # message types for APIs to use.
