https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls
Once the function source code upload is complete, the used signed

When uploading source code to the generated signed URL, please follow
these restrictions:

* Source file type should be a zip file.
* Source file size should not exceed 100MB limit.
* No credentials should be attached - the signed URLs provide access to the
  target bucket using internal service identity; if credentials were
  attached, the identity from the credentials would be used, but that
  identity does not have permissions to upload files to the URL.

When making a HTTP PUT request, these two headers need to be specified:
