          # bytes, the object transfer will fail. For more information, see

Args:
  pageSize: integer, The list page size. The max allowed value is 256.
  pageToken: string, The list page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, Required. A list of query parameters specified as JSON text in the form of:
{"project_id":"my_project_id",
 "job_names":["jobid1","jobid2",...],
 "job_statuses":["status1","status2",...]}.
Since `job_names` and `job_statuses` support multiple values, their values
