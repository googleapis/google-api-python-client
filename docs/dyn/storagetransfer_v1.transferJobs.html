Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # This resource represents the configuration of a transfer job that runs periodically.
  &quot;creationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time that the transfer job was created.
  &quot;deletionTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time that the transfer job was deleted.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description provided by the user for the job. Its max length is 1024 bytes when Unicode-encoded.
  &quot;lastModificationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time that the transfer job was last modified.
  &quot;latestOperationName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the most recently started TransferOperation of this JobConfig. Present if and only if at least one TransferOperation has been created for this JobConfig.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique name (within the transfer project) assigned when the job is created. If this field is empty in a CreateTransferJobRequest, Storage Transfer Service will assign a unique name. Otherwise, the specified name is used as the unique name for this job. If the specified name is in use by a job, the creation request fails with an ALREADY_EXISTS error. This name must start with `&quot;transferJobs/&quot;` prefix and end with a letter or a number, and should be no more than 128 characters. Example: `&quot;transferJobs/[A-Za-z0-9-._~]*[A-Za-z0-9]$&quot;` Invalid job names will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
  &quot;notificationConfig&quot;: { # Specification to configure notifications published to Cloud Pub/Sub.

    &quot;eventTypes&quot;: [ # Event types for which a notification is desired. If empty, send notifications for all event types.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;payloadFormat&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The desired format of the notification message payloads.
    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The `Topic.name` of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic to which to publish notifications. Must be of the format: `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. Not matching this format will result in an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
  },
  &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID of the Google Cloud Platform Project that owns the job.
  &quot;schedule&quot;: { # Transfers can be scheduled to recur or to run just once. # Specifies schedule for the transfer job. This is an optional field. When the field is not set, the job will never execute a transfer, unless you invoke RunTransferJob or update the job to have a non-empty schedule.

Related types are google.type.Date and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # The time in UTC that no further transfer operations are scheduled. Combined with schedule_end_date, `end_time_of_day` specifies the end date and time for starting new transfer operations. This field must be greater than or equal to the timestamp corresponding to the combintation of schedule_start_date and start_time_of_day, and is subject to the following: * If `end_time_of_day` is not set and `schedule_end_date` is set, then a default value of `23:59:59` is used for `end_time_of_day`. * If `end_time_of_day` is set and `schedule_end_date` is not set, then INVALID_ARGUMENT is returned.
      &quot;hours&quot;: 42, # Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23. An API may choose to allow the value &quot;24:00:00&quot; for scenarios like business closing time.
      &quot;minutes&quot;: 42, # Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59.
      &quot;nanos&quot;: 42, # Fractions of seconds in nanoseconds. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999.

    &quot;scheduleEndDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, such as a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are insignificant. The date is relative to the Gregorian Calendar. This can represent one of the following: * A full date, with non-zero year, month, and day values * A month and day value, with a zero year, such as an anniversary * A year on its own, with zero month and day values * A year and month value, with a zero day, such as a credit card expiration date Related types are google.type.TimeOfDay and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # The last day a transfer runs. Date boundaries are determined relative to UTC time. A job will run once per 24 hours within the following guidelines: * If `schedule_end_date` and schedule_start_date are the same and in the future relative to UTC, the transfer is executed only one time. * If `schedule_end_date` is later than `schedule_start_date` and `schedule_end_date` is in the future relative to UTC, the job will run each day at start_time_of_day through `schedule_end_date`.
      &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn&#x27;t significant.

The start date of a transfer. Date boundaries are determined relative to UTC time. If `schedule_start_date` and start_time_of_day are in the past relative to the job&#x27;s creation time, the transfer starts the day after you schedule the transfer request. **Note:** When starting jobs at or near midnight UTC it is possible that a job will start later than expected. For example, if you send an outbound request on June 1 one millisecond prior to midnight UTC and the Storage Transfer Service server receives the request on June 2, then it will create a TransferJob with `schedule_start_date` set to June 2 and a `start_time_of_day` set to midnight UTC. The first scheduled TransferOperation will take place on June 3 at midnight UTC.
      &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn&#x27;t significant.

    },
    &quot;startTimeOfDay&quot;: { # Represents a time of day. The date and time zone are either not significant or are specified elsewhere. An API may choose to allow leap seconds. Related types are google.type.Date and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # The time in UTC that a transfer job is scheduled to run. Transfers may start later than this time. If `start_time_of_day` is not specified: * One-time transfers run immediately. * Recurring transfers run immediately, and each day at midnight UTC, through schedule_end_date. If `start_time_of_day` is specified: * One-time transfers run at the specified time. * Recurring transfers run at the specified time each day, through `schedule_end_date`.

    },
  },
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Status of the job. This value MUST be specified for `CreateTransferJobRequests`. **Note:** The effect of the new job status takes place during a subsequent job run. For example, if you change the job status from ENABLED to DISABLED, and an operation spawned by the transfer is running, the status change would not affect the current operation.

Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields: * **HTTP URL** — The location of the object. * **Length** — The size of the object in bytes. * **MD5** — The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object. For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list). When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind: * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/` is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is `/`. * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object will not be transferred. * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer will fail. * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length` header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer. # An HTTP URL data source.

For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list).

The `last_modified_since` and `last_modified_before` fields can be used together for chunked data processing. For example, consider a script that processes each day&#x27;s worth of data at a time.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="run">run(jobName, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Attempts to start a new TransferOperation for the current TransferJob. A TransferJob has a maximum of one active TransferOperation. If this method is called while a TransferOperation is active, an error wil be returned.

Args:
  jobName: string, Required. The name of the transfer job. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request passed to RunTransferJob.
  &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The ID of the Google Cloud Platform Console project that owns the transfer job.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Represents the transfer operation object. To request a TransferOperation object, use transferOperations.get.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned unique name. The format of `name` is `transferOperations/some/unique/name`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
