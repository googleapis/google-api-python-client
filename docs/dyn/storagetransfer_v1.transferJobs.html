        # bytes, the object transfer will fail. For more information, see

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(filter=None, pageToken=None, pageSize=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists transfer jobs.

Args:
  filter: string, Required. A list of query parameters specified as JSON text in the form of:
{&quot;project&lt;span&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;id&quot;:&quot;my_project_id&quot;,
 &quot;job_names&quot;:[&quot;jobid1&quot;,&quot;jobid2&quot;,...],
 &quot;job_statuses&quot;:[&quot;status1&quot;,&quot;status2&quot;,...]}.
Since `job_names` and `job_statuses` support multiple values, their values
must be specified with array notation. `project`&lt;span&gt;`_`&lt;/span&gt;`id` is
required.  `job_names` and `job_statuses` are optional.  The valid values
for `job_statuses` are case-insensitive:
ENABLED,
DISABLED, and
DELETED.
  pageToken: string, The list page token.
  pageSize: integer, The list page size. The max allowed value is 256.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
