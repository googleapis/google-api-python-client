Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # This resource represents the configuration of a transfer job that runs
      # periodically.

      "objectConditions": { # Conditions that determine which objects will be transferred. Applies only # Only objects that satisfy these object conditions are included in the set

          # to S3 and Cloud Storage objects.

          # The "last modification time" refers to the time of the
          # last change to the object's content or metadata — specifically, this is

          # field of S3 objects.

            # have a "last modification time" are transferred.
            #
            # For each TransferOperation started by this TransferJob,

            #
            #   * Each include-prefix and exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash.

            #     namespace. No include-prefix may be a prefix of another
            #     include-prefix.

  <pre>Lists transfer jobs.

Args:
  pageSize: integer, The list page size. The max allowed value is 256.
  pageToken: string, The list page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  filter: string, Required. A list of query parameters specified as JSON text in the form of:
{"project&lt;span&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;id":"my_project_id",
 "job_names":["jobid1","jobid2",...],

Since `job_names` and `job_statuses` support multiple values, their values
must be specified with array notation. `project`&lt;span&gt;`_`&lt;/span&gt;`id` is

            #
            # When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind:
            #
            # * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/&lt;URL-path&gt;` is
            # transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is
            # `&lt;hostname&gt;/&lt;URL-path&gt;`.
            #
            # * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the
            # object fetched, the object will not be transferred.
            #
            # * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred
            # bytes, the object transfer will fail. For more information, see
            # [Generating MD5
            # hashes](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list#md5)
            #
            # * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For
            # example, in Cloud Storage you can
            # [share an object publicly]
            # (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get
