  &quot;creationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time that the transfer job was created.
  &quot;deletionTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time that the transfer job was deleted.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description provided by the user for the job. Its max length is 1024 bytes when Unicode-encoded.
  &quot;eventStream&quot;: { # Specifies the Event-driven transfer options. Event-driven transfers listen to an event stream to transfer updated files. # Specifies the event stream for the transfer job for event-driven transfers. When EventStream is specified, the Schedule fields are ignored.
    &quot;eventStreamExpirationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the data and time at which Storage Transfer Service stops listening for events from this stream. After this time, any transfers in progress will complete, but no new transfers are initiated.
    &quot;eventStreamStartTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the date and time that Storage Transfer Service starts listening for events from this stream. If no start time is specified or start time is in the past, Storage Transfer Service starts listening immediately.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Specifies a unique name of the resource such as AWS SQS ARN in the form &#x27;arn:aws:sqs:region:account_id:queue_name&#x27;, or Pub/Sub subscription resource name in the form &#x27;projects/{project}/subscriptions/{sub}&#x27;.
  },
  &quot;lastModificationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time that the transfer job was last modified.
  &quot;latestOperationName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the most recently started TransferOperation of this JobConfig. Present if a TransferOperation has been created for this JobConfig.

This option ignores [LoggableAction] and [LoggableActionState]. If these are set, Cloud Logging will also be enabled for this transfer.
    &quot;logActionStates&quot;: [ # States in which `log_actions` are logged. If empty, no logs are generated.
      &quot;A String&quot;,

If this field is empty in a CreateTransferJobRequest, Storage Transfer Service assigns a unique name. Otherwise, the specified name is used as the unique name for this job.

    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The `Topic.name` of the Pub/Sub topic to which to publish notifications. Must be of the format: `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. Not matching this format results in an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.

For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list). When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind: * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/` is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is `/`. * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object is not transferred. * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer fails. * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length` header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer. # An HTTP URL data source.

Wildcard matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * Each exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash. For example, to exclude the object `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`, specify the exclude-prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`. * None of the exclude-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object namespace.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="run">run(jobName, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts a new operation for the specified transfer job. A `TransferJob` has a maximum of one active `TransferOperation`. If this method is called while a `TransferOperation` is active, an error is returned.

Args:
  jobName: string, Required. The name of the transfer job. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request passed to RunTransferJob.
  &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that owns the transfer job.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.

It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

      },
    ],

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned unique name. The format of `name` is `transferOperations/some/unique/name`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
