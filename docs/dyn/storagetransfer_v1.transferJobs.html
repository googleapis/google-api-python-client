Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # This resource represents the configuration of a transfer job that runs periodically.
  &quot;creationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time that the transfer job was created.
  &quot;deletionTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time that the transfer job was deleted.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A description provided by the user for the job. Its max length is 1024 bytes when Unicode-encoded.
  &quot;lastModificationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time that the transfer job was last modified.
  &quot;latestOperationName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the most recently started TransferOperation of this JobConfig. Present if and only if at least one TransferOperation has been created for this JobConfig.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique name (within the transfer project) assigned when the job is created. If this field is empty in a CreateTransferJobRequest, Storage Transfer Service will assign a unique name. Otherwise, the specified name is used as the unique name for this job. If the specified name is in use by a job, the creation request fails with an ALREADY_EXISTS error. This name must start with `&quot;transferJobs/&quot;` prefix and end with a letter or a number, and should be no more than 128 characters. Example: `&quot;transferJobs/[A-Za-z0-9-._~]*[A-Za-z0-9]$&quot;` Invalid job names will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.

    ],
    &quot;payloadFormat&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The desired format of the notification message payloads.
    &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The `Topic.name` of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic to which to publish notifications. Must be of the format: `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. Not matching this format will result in an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.

Combined with schedule_end_date, `end_time_of_day` specifies the end date and time for starting new transfer operations. This field must be greater than or equal to the timestamp corresponding to the combintation of schedule_start_date and start_time_of_day, and is subject to the following: * If `end_time_of_day` is not set and `schedule_end_date` is set, then a default value of `23:59:59` is used for `end_time_of_day`. * If `end_time_of_day` is set and `schedule_end_date` is not set, then INVALID_ARGUMENT is returned.
      &quot;hours&quot;: 42, # Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23. An API may choose to allow the value &quot;24:00:00&quot; for scenarios like business closing time.

    &quot;scheduleEndDate&quot;: { # Represents a whole or partial calendar date, such as a birthday. The time of day and time zone are either specified elsewhere or are insignificant. The date is relative to the Gregorian Calendar. This can represent one of the following: * A full date, with non-zero year, month, and day values * A month and day value, with a zero year, such as an anniversary * A year on its own, with zero month and day values * A year and month value, with a zero day, such as a credit card expiration date Related types are google.type.TimeOfDay and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # The last day a transfer runs. Date boundaries are determined relative to UTC time. A job will run once per 24 hours within the following guidelines: * If `schedule_end_date` and schedule_start_date are the same and in the future relative to UTC, the transfer is executed only one time. * If `schedule_end_date` is later than `schedule_start_date` and `schedule_end_date` is in the future relative to UTC, the job will run each day at start_time_of_day through `schedule_end_date`.
      &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn&#x27;t significant.

The start date of a transfer. Date boundaries are determined relative to UTC time. If `schedule_start_date` and start_time_of_day are in the past relative to the job&#x27;s creation time, the transfer starts the day after you schedule the transfer request. **Note:** When starting jobs at or near midnight UTC it is possible that a job will start later than expected. For example, if you send an outbound request on June 1 one millisecond prior to midnight UTC and the Storage Transfer Service server receives the request on June 2, then it will create a TransferJob with `schedule_start_date` set to June 2 and a `start_time_of_day` set to midnight UTC. The first scheduled TransferOperation will take place on June 3 at midnight UTC.
      &quot;day&quot;: 42, # Day of a month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year and month, or 0 to specify a year by itself or a year and month where the day isn&#x27;t significant.

Related types are google.type.Date and `google.protobuf.Timestamp`. # The time in UTC that a transfer job is scheduled to run. Transfers may start later than this time. If `start_time_of_day` is not specified: * One-time transfers run immediately. * Recurring transfers run immediately, and each day at midnight UTC, through schedule_end_date. If `start_time_of_day` is specified: * One-time transfers run at the specified time. * Recurring transfers run at the specified time each day, through `schedule_end_date`.

Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields: * **HTTP URL** — The location of the object. * **Length** — The size of the object in bytes. * **MD5** — The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object. For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list). When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind: * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/` is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is `/`. * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object will not be transferred. * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer will fail. * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length` header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer. # An HTTP URL data source.

For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list). When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind: * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/` is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is `/`. * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object will not be transferred. * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer will fail. * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length` header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer. # An HTTP URL data source.
