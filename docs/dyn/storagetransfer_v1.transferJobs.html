  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique name (within the transfer project) assigned when the job is created. If this field is empty in a CreateTransferJobRequest, Storage Transfer Service assigns a unique name. Otherwise, the specified name is used as the unique name for this job.

  &quot;schedule&quot;: { # Transfers can be scheduled to recur or to run just once. # Specifies schedule for the transfer job. This is an optional field. When the field is not set, the job never executes a transfer, unless you invoke RunTransferJob or update the job to have a non-empty schedule.

This field must be greater than or equal to the timestamp corresponding to the combintation of schedule_start_date and start_time_of_day, and is subject to the following: * If `end_time_of_day` is not set and `schedule_end_date` is set, then a default value of `23:59:59` is used for `end_time_of_day`. * If `end_time_of_day` is set and `schedule_end_date` is not set, then INVALID_ARGUMENT is returned.
      &quot;hours&quot;: 42, # Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23. An API may choose to allow the value &quot;24:00:00&quot; for scenarios like business closing time.
      &quot;minutes&quot;: 42, # Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59.

For example, if you send an outbound request on June 1 one millisecond prior to midnight UTC and the Storage Transfer Service server receives the request on June 2, then it creates a TransferJob with `schedule_start_date` set to June 2 and a `start_time_of_day` set to midnight UTC.

For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length` header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer. # An HTTP URL data source.

If exclude_prefixes is specified, objects must not start with any of the `exclude_prefixes` specified for inclusion in the transfer. The following are requirements of `include_prefixes`: * Each include-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. Wildcard matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * Each include-prefix must omit the leading slash. For example, to include the object `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`, specify the include-prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`. * None of the include-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each include-prefix must include a distinct portion of the object namespace. No include-prefix may be a prefix of another include-prefix. The max size of `include_prefixes` is 1000.

Subsequent lines specify the information of the list of objects, one object per list entry. Each entry has the following tab-delimited fields: * **HTTP URL** — The location of the object. * **Length** — The size of the object in bytes. * **MD5** — The base64-encoded MD5 hash of the object. For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list). When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind: * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/` is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is `/`. * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object is not transferred. * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer fails. * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length` header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer. # An HTTP URL data source.

For an example of a valid TSV file, see [Transferring data from URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-url-list). When transferring data based on a URL list, keep the following in mind: * When an object located at `http(s)://hostname:port/` is transferred to a data sink, the name of the object at the data sink is `/`. * If the specified size of an object does not match the actual size of the object fetched, the object is not transferred. * If the specified MD5 does not match the MD5 computed from the transferred bytes, the object transfer fails. * Ensure that each URL you specify is publicly accessible. For example, in Cloud Storage you can [share an object publicly] (/storage/docs/cloud-console#_sharingdata) and get a link to it. * Storage Transfer Service obeys `robots.txt` rules and requires the source HTTP server to support `Range` requests and to return a `Content-Length` header in each response. * ObjectConditions have no effect when filtering objects to transfer. # An HTTP URL data source.

For example, if you send an outbound request on June 1 one millisecond prior to midnight UTC and the Storage Transfer Service server receives the request on June 2, then it creates a TransferJob with `schedule_start_date` set to June 2 and a `start_time_of_day` set to midnight UTC.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="run">run(jobName, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Starts a new operation for the specified transfer job. A `TransferJob` has a maximum of one active `TransferOperation`. If this method is called while a `TransferOperation` is active, an error is returned.

Args:
  jobName: string, Required. The name of the transfer job. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request passed to RunTransferJob.
  &quot;projectId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that owns the transfer job.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Represents the transfer operation object. To request a TransferOperation object, use transferOperations.get.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned unique name. The format of `name` is `transferOperations/some/unique/name`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
