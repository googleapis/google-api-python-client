  <pre>Retrieves an aggregated list of future reservations.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  includeAllScopes: boolean, Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="cancel">cancel(project, zone, futureReservation, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Cancel the specified future reservation.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, Name of the zone for this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  futureReservation: string, Name of the future reservation to retrieve. Name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  <pre>Deletes the specified future reservation.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, Name of the zone for this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  futureReservation: string, Name of the future reservation to retrieve. Name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>A list of all the future reservations that have been configured for the specified project in specified zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, Name of the zone for this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ```
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

      1 - v1 error format

Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.

    ],
  },
  &quot;httpErrorMessage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error message that was returned, such as `NOT FOUND`.
  &quot;httpErrorStatusCode&quot;: 42, # [Output Only] If the operation fails, this field contains the HTTP error status code that was returned. For example, a `404` means the resource was not found.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The unique identifier for the operation. This identifier is defined by the server.
  &quot;insertTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The time that this operation was requested. This value is in RFC3339 text format.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;compute#operation&quot;, # [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always `compute#operation` for Operation resources.
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # [Output Only] Service-specific metadata attached to this operation.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.

  &quot;progress&quot;: 42, # [Output Only] An optional progress indicator that ranges from 0 to 100. There is no requirement that this be linear or support any granularity of operations. This should not be used to guess when the operation will be complete. This number should monotonically increase as the operation progresses.
  &quot;region&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the region where the operation resides. Only applicable when performing regional operations.
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

  &quot;targetLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] The URL of the resource that the operation modifies. For operations related to creating a snapshot, this points to the persistent disk that the snapshot was created from.
  &quot;user&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] User who requested the operation, for example: `user@example.com`.
  &quot;warnings&quot;: [ # [Output Only] If warning messages are generated during processing of the operation, this field will be populated.
    {
      &quot;code&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A warning code, if applicable. For example, Compute Engine returns NO_RESULTS_ON_PAGE if there are no results in the response.
      &quot;data&quot;: [ # [Output Only] Metadata about this warning in key: value format. For example: &quot;data&quot;: [ { &quot;key&quot;: &quot;scope&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;zones/us-east1-d&quot; }
        {
          &quot;key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Output Only] A key that provides more detail on the warning being returned.
