  <pre>Creates a new AutomatedDnsRecord in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource&#x27;s name of the AutomatedDnsRecord. ex. projects/123/locations/us-east1 (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a DNS record managed by the AutomatedDnsRecord API.
  &quot;consumerNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The full resource path of the consumer network this AutomatedDnsRecord is visible to. Example: &quot;projects/{projectNumOrId}/global/networks/{networkName}&quot;.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp of when the record was created.
  &quot;creationMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The creation mode of the AutomatedDnsRecord. This field is immutable.
  &quot;currentConfig&quot;: { # Defines the configuration of a DNS record. # Output only. The current settings for this record as identified by (`hostname`, `dns_suffix`, `type`) in Cloud DNS. The `current_config` field reflects the actual settings of the DNS record in Cloud DNS based on the `hostname`, `dns_suffix`, and `type`. * **Absence:** If `current_config` is unset, it means a DNS record with the specified `hostname`, `dns_suffix`, and `type` does not currently exist in Cloud DNS. This could be because the `AutomatedDnsRecord` has never been successfully programmed, has been deleted, or there was an error during provisioning. * **Presence:** If `current_config` is present: * It can be different from the `original_config`. This can happen due to several reasons: * Out-of-band changes: A consumer might have directly modified the DNS record in Cloud DNS. * `OVERWRITE` operations from other `AutomatedDnsRecord` resources: Another `AutomatedDnsRecord` with the same identifying attributes (`hostname`, `dns_suffix`, `type`) but a different configuration might have overwritten the record using `insert_mode: OVERWRITE`. Therefore, the presence of `current_config` indicates that a corresponding DNS record exists, but its values (TTL and RRData) might not always align with the `original_config` of the AutomatedDnsRecord.
    &quot;rrdatas&quot;: [ # Required. The list of resource record data strings. The content and format of these strings depend on the AutomatedDnsRecord.type. For many common record types, this list may contain multiple strings. As defined in RFC 1035 (section 5) and RFC 1034 (section 3.6.1) -- see examples. Examples: A record: [&quot;192.0.2.1&quot;] or [&quot;192.0.2.1&quot;, &quot;192.0.2.2&quot;] TXT record: [&quot;This is a text record&quot;] CNAME record: [&quot;target.example.com.&quot;] AAAA record: [&quot;::1&quot;] or [&quot;2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334&quot;, &quot;2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7335&quot;]

  &quot;dnsZone&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. DnsZone is the DNS zone managed by automation. Format: projects/{project}/managedZones/{managedZone}
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The etag is computed by the server, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.

  &quot;hostname&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The hostname for the DNS record. This value will be prepended to the `dns_suffix` to create the full domain name (FQDN) for the record. For example, if `hostname` is &quot;corp.db&quot; and `dns_suffix` is &quot;example.com.&quot;, the resulting record will be &quot;corp.db.example.com.&quot;. Should not include a trailing dot.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. User-defined labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Identifier. The name of an AutomatedDnsRecord. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/automatedDnsRecords/{automated_dns_record} See: https://google.aip.dev/122#fields-representing-resource-names
  &quot;originalConfig&quot;: { # Defines the configuration of a DNS record. # Required. Immutable. The configuration settings used to create this DNS record. These settings define the desired state of the record as specified by the producer.
    &quot;rrdatas&quot;: [ # Required. The list of resource record data strings. The content and format of these strings depend on the AutomatedDnsRecord.type.

    &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Number of seconds that this DNS record can be cached by resolvers.
  },
  &quot;recordType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The identifier of a supported record type.
  &quot;serviceClass&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The service class identifier which authorizes this AutomatedDnsRecord. Any API calls targeting this AutomatedDnsRecord must have `networkconnectivity.serviceclasses.use` IAM permission for the provided service class.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current operational state of this AutomatedDnsRecord as managed by Service Connectivity Automation.
  &quot;stateDetails&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A human-readable message providing more context about the current state, such as an error description if the state is `FAILED_DEPROGRAMMING`.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp of when the record was updated.
}

  automatedDnsRecordId: string, Optional. Resource ID (i.e. &#x27;foo&#x27; in &#x27;[...]/projects/p/locations/l/automatedDnsRecords/foo&#x27;) See https://google.aip.dev/122#resource-id-segments Unique per location. If one is not provided, one will be generated.
  insertMode: string, Optional. The insert mode when creating AutomatedDnsRecord.
    Allowed values
      INSERT_MODE_UNSPECIFIED - An invalid insert mode as the default case.
      FAIL_IF_EXISTS - Fail the request if the record already exists in cloud DNS.
      OVERWRITE - Overwrite the existing record in cloud DNS.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

The `current_config` field reflects the actual settings of the DNS record in Cloud DNS based on the `hostname`, `dns_suffix`, and `type`. * **Absence:** If `current_config` is unset, it means a DNS record with the specified `hostname`, `dns_suffix`, and `type` does not currently exist in Cloud DNS. This could be because the `AutomatedDnsRecord` has never been successfully programmed, has been deleted, or there was an error during provisioning. * **Presence:** If `current_config` is present: * It can be different from the `original_config`. This can happen due to several reasons: * Out-of-band changes: A consumer might have directly modified the DNS record in Cloud DNS. * `OVERWRITE` operations from other `AutomatedDnsRecord` resources: Another `AutomatedDnsRecord` with the same identifying attributes (`hostname`, `dns_suffix`, `type`) but a different configuration might have overwritten the record using `insert_mode: OVERWRITE`. Therefore, the presence of `current_config` indicates that a corresponding DNS record exists, but its values (TTL and RRData) might not always align with the `original_config` of the AutomatedDnsRecord.
