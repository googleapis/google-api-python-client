  <pre>Deletes the specified regional BackendService resource.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  backendService: string, Name of the BackendService resource to delete. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

    { # Represents a Backend Service resource. A backend service defines how Google Cloud load balancers distribute traffic. The backend service configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the settings have default values that allow for easy configuration if you need to get started quickly. Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped. * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendServices) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionBackendServices) For more information, see Backend Services.

This setting is applicable to external and internal HTTP(S) load balancers and Traffic Director and requires GENERATED_COOKIE or HTTP_COOKIE session affinity. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The maximum allowed value is two weeks (1,209,600). Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.

For usage guidelines, see Connection balancing mode. Backends must use compatible balancing modes. For more information, see Supported balancing modes and target capacity settings and Restrictions and guidance for instance groups. Note: Currently, if you use the API to configure incompatible balancing modes, the configuration might be accepted even though it has no impact and is ignored. Specifically, Backend.maxUtilization is ignored when Backend.balancingMode is RATE. In the future, this incompatible combination will be rejected.
      &quot;capacityScaler&quot;: 3.14, # A multiplier applied to the backend&#x27;s target capacity of its balancing mode. The default value is 1, which means the group serves up to 100% of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available capacity. The valid ranges are 0.0 and [0.1,1.0]. You cannot configure a setting larger than 0 and smaller than 0.1. You cannot configure a setting of 0 when there is only one backend attached to the backend service. Not available with backends that don&#x27;t support using a balancingMode. This includes backends such as global internet NEGs, regional serverless NEGs, and PSC NEGs.
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.
      &quot;failover&quot;: True or False, # This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More than one failover backend can be configured for a given BackendService.
      &quot;group&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The fully-qualified URL of an instance group or network endpoint group (NEG) resource. To determine what types of backends a load balancer supports, see the [Backend services overview](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#backends).

    &quot;cacheMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these headers will not be cached at Google&#x27;s edge, and will require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.
    &quot;clientTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
    &quot;defaultTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;maxTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

The backend service configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the settings have default values that allow for easy configuration if you need to get started quickly. Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped. * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendServices) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionBackendServices) For more information, see Backend Services.

For more information, see Supported balancing modes and target capacity settings and Restrictions and guidance for instance groups. Note: Currently, if you use the API to configure incompatible balancing modes, the configuration might be accepted even though it has no impact and is ignored. Specifically, Backend.maxUtilization is ignored when Backend.balancingMode is RATE. In the future, this incompatible combination will be rejected.
      &quot;capacityScaler&quot;: 3.14, # A multiplier applied to the backend&#x27;s target capacity of its balancing mode.

FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS).

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, region, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of regional BackendService resources available to the specified project in the given region.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS).

For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present.

FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.

With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).

Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  <pre>Updates the specified regional BackendService resource with the data included in the request. For more information, see Backend services overview .

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  backendService: string, Name of the BackendService resource to update. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a Backend Service resource. A backend service defines how Google Cloud load balancers distribute traffic. The backend service configuration contains a set of values, such as the protocol used to connect to backends, various distribution and session settings, health checks, and timeouts. These settings provide fine-grained control over how your load balancer behaves. Most of the settings have default values that allow for easy configuration if you need to get started quickly. Backend services in Google Compute Engine can be either regionally or globally scoped. * [Global](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendServices) * [Regional](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionBackendServices) For more information, see Backend Services.
  &quot;affinityCookieTtlSec&quot;: 42, # Lifetime of cookies in seconds. This setting is applicable to external and internal HTTP(S) load balancers and Traffic Director and requires GENERATED_COOKIE or HTTP_COOKIE session affinity. If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The maximum allowed value is two weeks (1,209,600). Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
  &quot;backends&quot;: [ # The list of backends that serve this BackendService.

      &quot;balancingMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies how to determine whether the backend of a load balancer can handle additional traffic or is fully loaded. For usage guidelines, see Connection balancing mode. Backends must use compatible balancing modes. For more information, see Supported balancing modes and target capacity settings and Restrictions and guidance for instance groups. Note: Currently, if you use the API to configure incompatible balancing modes, the configuration might be accepted even though it has no impact and is ignored. Specifically, Backend.maxUtilization is ignored when Backend.balancingMode is RATE. In the future, this incompatible combination will be rejected.
      &quot;capacityScaler&quot;: 3.14, # A multiplier applied to the backend&#x27;s target capacity of its balancing mode. The default value is 1, which means the group serves up to 100% of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available capacity. The valid ranges are 0.0 and [0.1,1.0]. You cannot configure a setting larger than 0 and smaller than 0.1. You cannot configure a setting of 0 when there is only one backend attached to the backend service. Not available with backends that don&#x27;t support using a balancingMode. This includes backends such as global internet NEGs, regional serverless NEGs, and PSC NEGs.

    },
    &quot;cacheMode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these headers will not be cached at Google&#x27;s edge, and will require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any &quot;private&quot;, &quot;no-store&quot; or &quot;no-cache&quot; directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.
    &quot;clientTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL. This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client. With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for the response max-age directive, along with a &quot;public&quot; directive. For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a &quot;public&quot; cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
    &quot;defaultTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age). Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The value of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;maxTtl&quot;: 42, # Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not be modified. Setting a TTL of &quot;0&quot; means &quot;always revalidate&quot;. The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    &quot;negativeCaching&quot;: True or False, # Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in negative_caching_policy.
    &quot;negativeCachingPolicy&quot;: [ # Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN&#x27;s default cache TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache. Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a policy exists.

    &quot;serveWhileStale&quot;: 42, # Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered when refreshing the cache. This setting defines the default &quot;max-stale&quot; duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1 week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.

They do not persist for UDP. If set to NEVER_PERSIST, after a backend becomes unhealthy, the existing connections on the unhealthy backend are never persisted on the unhealthy backend. They are always diverted to newly selected healthy backends (unless all backends are unhealthy). If set to ALWAYS_PERSIST, existing connections always persist on unhealthy backends regardless of protocol and session affinity.

This is the default. - LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests. - RING_HASH: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests. - RANDOM: The load balancer selects a random healthy host. - ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load balancer. - MAGLEV: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times.

}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
