Note that the first few rules (e.g. minimum_runtime_constraint, min_num_trials) will prevent other stopping rules from being evaluated until they are met. For example, setting `min_num_trials=5` and `always_stop_after= 1 hour` means that the Study will ONLY stop after it has 5 COMPLETED trials, even if more than an hour has passed since its creation. It follows the first applicable rule (whose &quot;if&quot; condition is satisfied) to make a stopping decision. If none of the specified rules are applicable, then Vizier decides that the study should not stop. If Vizier decides that the study should stop, the study enters STOPPING state (or STOPPING_ASAP if should_stop_asap = true). IMPORTANT: The automatic study state transition happens precisely as described above; that is, deleting trials or updating StudyConfig NEVER automatically moves the study state back to ACTIVE. If you want to _resume_ a Study that was stopped, 1) change the stopping conditions if necessary, 2) activate the study, and then 3) ask for suggestions. If the specified time or duration has not passed, do not stop the study.

For example, setting `min_num_trials=5` and `always_stop_after= 1 hour` means that the Study will ONLY stop after it has 5 COMPLETED trials, even if more than an hour has passed since its creation. It follows the first applicable rule (whose &quot;if&quot; condition is satisfied) to make a stopping decision. If none of the specified rules are applicable, then Vizier decides that the study should not stop. If Vizier decides that the study should stop, the study enters STOPPING state (or STOPPING_ASAP if should_stop_asap = true).
