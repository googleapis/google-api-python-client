  <pre>Creates a saved query in a parent project/folder/organization.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The name of the project/folder/organization where this saved_query should be created in. It can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A saved query which can be shared with others or used later.
  &quot;content&quot;: { # The query content. # The query content.
    &quot;iamPolicyAnalysisQuery&quot;: { # IAM policy analysis query message. # An IAM Policy Analysis query, which could be used in the AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy RPC or the AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning RPC.
      &quot;accessSelector&quot;: { # Specifies roles and/or permissions to analyze, to determine both the identities possessing them and the resources they control. If multiple values are specified, results will include roles or permissions matching any of them. The total number of roles and permissions should be equal or less than 10. # Optional. Specifies roles or permissions for analysis. This is optional.
        &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # Optional. The permissions to appear in result.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;roles&quot;: [ # Optional. The roles to appear in result.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
      },
      &quot;conditionContext&quot;: { # The IAM conditions context. # Optional. The hypothetical context for IAM conditions evaluation.
        &quot;accessTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The hypothetical access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions. Note that this value must not be earlier than the current time; otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.
      },
      &quot;identitySelector&quot;: { # Specifies an identity for which to determine resource access, based on roles assigned either directly to them or to the groups they belong to, directly or indirectly. # Optional. Specifies an identity for analysis.
        &quot;identity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The identity appear in the form of principals in [IAM policy binding](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Binding). The examples of supported forms are: &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot;. Notice that wildcard characters (such as * and ?) are not supported. You must give a specific identity.
      },
      &quot;options&quot;: { # Contains query options. # Optional. The query options.
        &quot;analyzeServiceAccountImpersonation&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning RPC instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, and there&#x27;s an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there&#x27;s another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Only the following permissions are considered in this analysis: * `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` * `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` * `iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt` * `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken` * `iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken` * `iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation` Default is false.
        &quot;expandGroups&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in an IAM policy binding. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.identity_selector is specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. If true, the default max expansion per group is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][]. Default is false.
        &quot;expandResources&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results include an IAM policy with P on a Google Cloud folder, the results will also include resources in that folder with permission P. If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resources cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource. If true, the default max expansion per resource is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][] and 100000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning][]. Default is false.
        &quot;expandRoles&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the access section of result will expand any roles appearing in IAM policy bindings to include their permissions. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.access_selector is specified, the access section of the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed to set. Default is false.
        &quot;outputGroupEdges&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant membership relationships between groups and other groups, and between groups and principals. Default is false.
        &quot;outputResourceEdges&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If true, the result will output the relevant parent/child relationships between resources. Default is false.
      },
      &quot;resourceSelector&quot;: { # Specifies the resource to analyze for access policies, which may be set directly on the resource, or on ancestors such as organizations, folders or projects. # Optional. Specifies a resource for analysis.
        &quot;fullResourceName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The [full resource name] (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/resource-name-format) of a resource of [supported resource types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#analyzable_asset_types).
      },
      &quot;scope&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only resources and IAM policies within the scope will be analyzed. This can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), or a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;).

    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;lastUpdateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The last update time of this saved query.
  &quot;lastUpdater&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The account&#x27;s email address who has updated this saved query most recently.

If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resources cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource.
