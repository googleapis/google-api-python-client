<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="importVariants">importVariants(variantSetId, body)</code>
  <pre>Creates variant data by asynchronously importing the provided information.

The variants for import will be merged with any existing data and each other according to the behavior of mergeVariants. In particular, this means for merged VCF variants that have conflicting INFO fields, some data will be arbitrarily discarded. As a special case, for single-sample VCF files, QUAL and FILTER fields will be moved to the call level; these are sometimes interpreted in a call-specific context. Imported VCF headers are appended to the metadata already in a variant set.

Args:
  variantSetId: string, Required. The variant set to which variant data should be imported. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The variant data import request.
    "normalizeReferenceNames": True or False, # Convert reference names to the canonical representation. hg19 haploytypes (those reference names containing "_hap") are not modified in any way. All other reference names are modified according to the following rules: The reference name is capitalized. The "chr" prefix is dropped for all autosomes and sex chromsomes. For example "chr17" becomes "17" and "chrX" becomes "X". All mitochondrial chromosomes ("chrM", "chrMT", etc) become "MT".
    "sourceUris": [ # A list of URIs referencing variant files in Google Cloud Storage. URIs can include wildcards as described here. Note that recursive wildcards ('**') are not supported.

<div class="method">

  <pre>Merges the given variants with existing variants. Each variant will be merged with an existing variant that matches its reference sequence, start, end, reference bases, and alternative bases. If no such variant exists, a new one will be created.

When variants are merged, the call information from the new variant is added to the existing variant, and other fields (such as key/value pairs) are discarded.

      "upperBound": "A String", # An upper bound (inclusive) on the starting coordinate of any variant in the reference sequence.
      "referenceName": "A String", # The reference the bound is associate with.
    },
  ],
  "id": "A String", # The Google-generated ID of the variant set. Immutable.
  "datasetId": "A String", # The dataset to which this variant set belongs. Immutable.
  "metadata": [ # The metadata associated with this variant set.

        "a_key": [ # A string which maps to an array of values.
          "A String",
        ],
      },
      "description": "A String", # A textual description of this metadata.
      "number": "A String", # The number of values that can be included in a field described by this metadata.
      "value": "A String", # The value field for simple metadata
      "key": "A String", # The top-level key.
      "type": "A String", # The type of data. Possible types include: Integer, Float, Flag, Character, and String.
