<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new variant set (only necessary in v1).

The provided variant set must have a valid datasetId set - all other fields are optional. Note that the id field will be ignored, as this is assigned by the server.

Args:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="importVariants">importVariants(variantSetId, body)</code>
  <pre>Creates variant data by asynchronously importing the provided information.

The variants for import will be merged with any existing data and each other according to the behavior of mergeVariants. In particular, this means for merged VCF variants that have conflicting info fields, some data will be arbitrarily discarded. As a special case, for single-sample VCF files, QUAL and FILTER fields will be moved to the call level; these are sometimes interpreted in a call-specific context. Imported VCF headers are appended to the metadata already in a variant set.

    The object takes the form of:

{ # The variant data import request.
    "normalizeReferenceNames": True or False, # Convert reference names to the canonical representation. hg19 haploytypes (those reference names containing "_hap") are not modified in any way. All other reference names are modified according to the following rules: The reference name is capitalized. The "chr" prefix is dropped for all autosomes and sex chromsomes. For example "chr17" becomes "17" and "chrX" becomes "X". All mitochondrial chromosomes ("chrM", "chrMT", etc) become "MT".

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="mergeVariants">mergeVariants(variantSetId, body)</code>
  <pre>Merges the given variants with existing variants. Each variant will be merged with an existing variant that matches its reference sequence, start, end, reference bases, and alternative bases. If no such variant exists, a new one will be created.

When variants are merged, the call information from the new variant is added to the existing variant, and other fields (such as key/value pairs) are discarded.
