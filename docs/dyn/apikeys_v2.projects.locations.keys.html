<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="clone">clone(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Clones the existing key&#x27;s restriction and display name to a new API key. The service account must have the `apikeys.keys.get` and `apikeys.keys.create` permissions in the project. NOTE: Key is a global resource; hence the only supported value for location is `global`.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name of the API key to be cloned in the same project. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `CloneKey` method.
  &quot;keyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User specified key id (optional). If specified, it will become the final component of the key resource name. The id must be unique within the project, must conform with RFC-1034, is restricted to lower-cased letters, and has a maximum length of 63 characters. In another word, the id must match the regular expression: `[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?`. The id must NOT be a UUID-like string.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
