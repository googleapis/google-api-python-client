<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(calendarId, eventId, sendNotifications=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes an event.

Args:
  calendarId: string, Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword. (required)
  eventId: string, Event identifier. (required)
  sendNotifications: boolean, Whether to send notifications about the deletion of the event. Optional. The default is False.
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">

  <pre>Returns an event.

Args:
  calendarId: string, Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword. (required)
  eventId: string, Event identifier. (required)
  alwaysIncludeEmail: boolean, Whether to always include a value in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided). The use of this option is discouraged and should only be used by clients which cannot handle the absence of an email address value in the mentioned places. Optional. The default is False.
  timeZone: string, Time zone used in the response. Optional. The default is the time zone of the calendar.
  maxAttendees: integer, The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.

  <pre>Returns events on the specified calendar.

Args:
  calendarId: string, Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword. (required)
  orderBy: string, The order of the events returned in the result. Optional. The default is an unspecified, stable order.
    Allowed values
      startTime - Order by the start date/time (ascending). This is only available when querying single events (i.e. the parameter singleEvents is True)
      updated - Order by last modification time (ascending).
  showHiddenInvitations: boolean, Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.
  timeMin: string, Lower bound (inclusive) for an event's end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, e.g., 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but will be ignored.
  privateExtendedProperty: string, Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only private properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints. (repeated)
  pageToken: string, Token specifying which result page to return. Optional.
  updatedMin: string, Lower bound for an event's last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showDeleted. Optional. The default is not to filter by last modification time.
  singleEvents: boolean, Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. Optional. The default is False.
  alwaysIncludeEmail: boolean, Whether to always include a value in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided). The use of this option is discouraged and should only be used by clients which cannot handle the absence of an email address value in the mentioned places. Optional. The default is False.
  showDeleted: boolean, Whether to include deleted events (with status equals "cancelled") in the result. Cancelled instances of recurring events (but not the underlying recurring event) will still be included if showDeleted and singleEvents are both False. If showDeleted and singleEvents are both True, only single instances of deleted events (but not the underlying recurring events) are returned. Optional. The default is False.
  sharedExtendedProperty: string, Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only shared properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints. (repeated)
  maxAttendees: integer, The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.
  syncToken: string, Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False.
There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state.

These are: 
- iCalUID 
- orderBy 
- privateExtendedProperty 
- q 
- sharedExtendedProperty 
- timeMin 
- timeMax 
- updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken.
Learn more about incremental synchronization.
Optional. The default is to return all entries.

  <pre>Watch for changes to Events resources.

Args:
  calendarId: string, Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "resourceUri": "A String", # A version-specific identifier for the watched resource.
    "kind": "api#channel", # Identifies this as a notification channel used to watch for changes to a resource. Value: the fixed string "api#channel".
    "resourceId": "A String", # An opaque ID that identifies the resource being watched on this channel. Stable across different API versions.
    "payload": True or False, # A Boolean value to indicate whether payload is wanted. Optional.
    "token": "A String", # An arbitrary string delivered to the target address with each notification delivered over this channel. Optional.
    "params": { # Additional parameters controlling delivery channel behavior. Optional.
      "a_key": "A String", # Declares a new parameter by name.
    },
    "expiration": "A String", # Date and time of notification channel expiration, expressed as a Unix timestamp, in milliseconds. Optional.
    "address": "A String", # The address where notifications are delivered for this channel.
    "type": "A String", # The type of delivery mechanism used for this channel.
    "id": "A String", # A UUID or similar unique string that identifies this channel.
  }

  orderBy: string, The order of the events returned in the result. Optional. The default is an unspecified, stable order.
    Allowed values
      startTime - Order by the start date/time (ascending). This is only available when querying single events (i.e. the parameter singleEvents is True)
      updated - Order by last modification time (ascending).
  showHiddenInvitations: boolean, Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.
  timeMin: string, Lower bound (inclusive) for an event's end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, e.g., 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but will be ignored.
  privateExtendedProperty: string, Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only private properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints. (repeated)
  pageToken: string, Token specifying which result page to return. Optional.
  updatedMin: string, Lower bound for an event's last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showDeleted. Optional. The default is not to filter by last modification time.
  singleEvents: boolean, Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. Optional. The default is False.
  alwaysIncludeEmail: boolean, Whether to always include a value in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided). The use of this option is discouraged and should only be used by clients which cannot handle the absence of an email address value in the mentioned places. Optional. The default is False.
  showDeleted: boolean, Whether to include deleted events (with status equals "cancelled") in the result. Cancelled instances of recurring events (but not the underlying recurring event) will still be included if showDeleted and singleEvents are both False. If showDeleted and singleEvents are both True, only single instances of deleted events (but not the underlying recurring events) are returned. Optional. The default is False.
  sharedExtendedProperty: string, Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only shared properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints. (repeated)
  maxAttendees: integer, The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.
  syncToken: string, Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False.
There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state.

These are: 
- iCalUID 
- orderBy 
- privateExtendedProperty 
- q 
- sharedExtendedProperty 
- timeMin 
- timeMax 
- updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken.
Learn more about incremental synchronization.
Optional. The default is to return all entries.
  iCalUID: string, Specifies event ID in the iCalendar format to be included in the response. Optional.
  maxResults: integer, Maximum number of events returned on one result page. By default the value is 250 events. The page size can never be larger than 2500 events. Optional.
  timeMax: string, Upper bound (exclusive) for an event's start time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by start time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, e.g., 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but will be ignored.
  q: string, Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in any field, except for extended properties. Optional.
  timeZone: string, Time zone used in the response. Optional. The default is the time zone of the calendar.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
      "resourceUri": "A String", # A version-specific identifier for the watched resource.
      "kind": "api#channel", # Identifies this as a notification channel used to watch for changes to a resource. Value: the fixed string "api#channel".
