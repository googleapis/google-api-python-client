      # If you do not specify an ID, it will be automatically generated by the server.

On the organizer&#x27;s calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.

      # A cancelled status represents two different states depending on the event type:
      # - Cancelled exceptions of an uncancelled recurring event indicate that this instance should no longer be presented to the user. Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event.
      # Cancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.
      # - All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely.
      # Deleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer&#x27;s calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details.

      # - &quot;transparent&quot; - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.
  &quot;updated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Last modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.
  &quot;visibility&quot;: &quot;default&quot;, # Visibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:
      # - &quot;default&quot; - Uses the default visibility for events on the calendar. This is the default value.
      # - &quot;public&quot; - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.
      # - &quot;private&quot; - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.
      # - &quot;confidential&quot; - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.

      startTime - Order by the start date/time (ascending). This is only available when querying single events (i.e. the parameter singleEvents is True)
      updated - Order by last modification time (ascending).
  pageToken: string, Token specifying which result page to return. Optional.
  privateExtendedProperty: string, Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only private properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints. (repeated)
  q: string, Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in any field, except for extended properties. Optional.
  sharedExtendedProperty: string, Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only shared properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints. (repeated)
  showDeleted: boolean, Whether to include deleted events (with status equals &quot;cancelled&quot;) in the result. Cancelled instances of recurring events (but not the underlying recurring event) will still be included if showDeleted and singleEvents are both False. If showDeleted and singleEvents are both True, only single instances of deleted events (but not the underlying recurring events) are returned. Optional. The default is False.
  showHiddenInvitations: boolean, Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.
  singleEvents: boolean, Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. Optional. The default is False.
  syncToken: string, Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False.
There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state.

These are: 
- iCalUID 
- orderBy 
- privateExtendedProperty 
- q 
- sharedExtendedProperty 
- timeMin 
- timeMax 
- updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken.
Learn more about incremental synchronization.
Optional. The default is to return all entries.
  timeMax: string, Upper bound (exclusive) for an event&#x27;s start time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by start time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, for example, 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but are ignored. If timeMin is set, timeMax must be greater than timeMin.
  timeMin: string, Lower bound (exclusive) for an event&#x27;s end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, for example, 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but are ignored. If timeMax is set, timeMin must be smaller than timeMax.
  timeZone: string, Time zone used in the response. Optional. The default is the time zone of the calendar.
  updatedMin: string, Lower bound for an event&#x27;s last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showDeleted. Optional. The default is not to filter by last modification time.

      # - &quot;transparent&quot; - The event does not block time on the calendar. This is equivalent to setting Show me as to Available in the Calendar UI.
  &quot;updated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Last modification time of the event (as a RFC3339 timestamp). Read-only.
  &quot;visibility&quot;: &quot;default&quot;, # Visibility of the event. Optional. Possible values are:

      # - &quot;public&quot; - The event is public and event details are visible to all readers of the calendar.
      # - &quot;private&quot; - The event is private and only event attendees may view event details.
      # - &quot;confidential&quot; - The event is private. This value is provided for compatibility reasons.

      # Deleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer&#x27;s calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details.

  q: string, Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in any field, except for extended properties. Optional.
  sharedExtendedProperty: string, Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only shared properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints. (repeated)
  showDeleted: boolean, Whether to include deleted events (with status equals &quot;cancelled&quot;) in the result. Cancelled instances of recurring events (but not the underlying recurring event) will still be included if showDeleted and singleEvents are both False. If showDeleted and singleEvents are both True, only single instances of deleted events (but not the underlying recurring events) are returned. Optional. The default is False.
  showHiddenInvitations: boolean, Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.
  singleEvents: boolean, Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. Optional. The default is False.
  syncToken: string, Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False.
There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state.

These are: 
- iCalUID 
- orderBy 
- privateExtendedProperty 
- q 
- sharedExtendedProperty 
- timeMin 
- timeMax 
- updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken.

Optional. The default is to return all entries.
  timeMax: string, Upper bound (exclusive) for an event&#x27;s start time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by start time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, for example, 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but are ignored. If timeMin is set, timeMax must be greater than timeMin.
  timeMin: string, Lower bound (exclusive) for an event&#x27;s end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, for example, 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but are ignored. If timeMax is set, timeMin must be smaller than timeMax.
  timeZone: string, Time zone used in the response. Optional. The default is the time zone of the calendar.
  updatedMin: string, Lower bound for an event&#x27;s last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showDeleted. Optional. The default is not to filter by last modification time.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
  &quot;address&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The address where notifications are delivered for this channel.
  &quot;expiration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Date and time of notification channel expiration, expressed as a Unix timestamp, in milliseconds. Optional.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A UUID or similar unique string that identifies this channel.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;api#channel&quot;, # Identifies this as a notification channel used to watch for changes to a resource, which is &quot;api#channel&quot;.
  &quot;params&quot;: { # Additional parameters controlling delivery channel behavior. Optional.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Declares a new parameter by name.
  },
  &quot;payload&quot;: True or False, # A Boolean value to indicate whether payload is wanted. Optional.
  &quot;resourceId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An opaque ID that identifies the resource being watched on this channel. Stable across different API versions.
  &quot;resourceUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A version-specific identifier for the watched resource.
  &quot;token&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An arbitrary string delivered to the target address with each notification delivered over this channel. Optional.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of delivery mechanism used for this channel. Valid values are &quot;web_hook&quot; (or &quot;webhook&quot;). Both values refer to a channel where Http requests are used to deliver messages.
