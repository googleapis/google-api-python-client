<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new annotation set. Caller must have WRITE permission for the associated dataset.

The following fields must be provided when creating an annotation set:  
- datasetId 
- referenceSetId  
All other fields may be optionally specified, unless documented as being server-generated (for example, the id field).

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An annotation set is a logical grouping of annotations that share consistent type information and provenance. Examples of annotation sets include 'all genes from refseq', and 'all variant annotations from ClinVar'.
  "info": { # A string which maps to an array of values.
    "a_key": [ # A string which maps to an array of values.
      "A String",
    ],
  },
  "name": "A String", # The display name for this annotation set.
  "sourceUri": "A String", # The source URI describing the file from which this annotation set was generated, if any.
  "type": "A String", # The type of annotations contained within this set.
  "referenceSetId": "A String", # The ID of the reference set that defines the coordinate space for this set's annotations.
