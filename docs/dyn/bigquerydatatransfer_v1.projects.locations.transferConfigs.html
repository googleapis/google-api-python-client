  <pre>Creates a new data transfer configuration.

Args:
  parent: string, The BigQuery project id where the transfer configuration should be created.
Must be in the format projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}
If specified location and location of the destination bigquery dataset
do not match - the request will fail. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Represents a data transfer configuration. A transfer configuration
    # contains all metadata needed to perform a data transfer. For example,
    # `destination_dataset_id` specifies where data should be stored.
    # When a new transfer configuration is created, the specified
    # `destination_dataset_id` is created when needed and shared with the
    # appropriate data source service account.
  "dataRefreshWindowDays": 42, # The number of days to look back to automatically refresh the data.
      # For example, if `data_refresh_window_days = 10`, then every day
      # BigQuery reingests data for [today-10, today-1], rather than ingesting data
      # for just [today-1].
      # Only valid if the data source supports the feature. Set the value to  0
      # to use the default value.
  "updateTime": "A String", # Output only. Data transfer modification time. Ignored by server on input.
  "destinationDatasetId": "A String", # The BigQuery target dataset id.
  "displayName": "A String", # User specified display name for the data transfer.
  "name": "A String", # The resource name of the transfer config.
      # Transfer config names have the form of
      # `projects/{project_id}/locations/{region}/transferConfigs/{config_id}`.
      # The name is automatically generated based on the config_id specified in
      # CreateTransferConfigRequest along with project_id and region. If config_id
      # is not provided, usually a uuid, even though it is not guaranteed or
      # required, will be generated for config_id.
  "schedule": "A String", # Data transfer schedule.
      # If the data source does not support a custom schedule, this should be
      # empty. If it is empty, the default value for the data source will be
      # used.
      # The specified times are in UTC.
      # Examples of valid format:
      # `1st,3rd monday of month 15:30`,
      # `every wed,fri of jan,jun 13:15`, and
      # `first sunday of quarter 00:00`.
      # See more explanation about the format here:

  authorizationCode: string, Optional OAuth2 authorization code to use with this transfer configuration.
This is required if new credentials are needed, as indicated by
`CheckValidCreds`.
In order to obtain authorization_code, please make a
request to
https://www.gstatic.com/bigquerydatatransfer/oauthz/auth?client_id=<datatransferapiclientid>&scope=<data_source_scopes>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>

* client_id should be OAuth client_id of BigQuery DTS API for the given
  data source returned by ListDataSources method.
* data_source_scopes are the scopes returned by ListDataSources method.
* redirect_uri is an optional parameter. If not specified, then
  authorization code is posted to the opener of authorization flow window.
  Otherwise it will be sent to the redirect uri. A special value of
  urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob means that authorization code should be
  returned in the title bar of the browser, with the page text prompting
  the user to copy the code and paste it in the application.
  versionInfo: string, Optional version info. If users want to find a very recent access token,
that is, immediately after approving access, users have to set the
version_info claim in the token request. To obtain the version_info, users
must use the “none+gsession” response type. which be return a
version_info back in the authorization response which be be put in a JWT
claim in the token request.

In order to obtain authorization_code, please make a
request to
https://www.gstatic.com/bigquerydatatransfer/oauthz/auth?client_id=<datatransferapiclientid>&scope=<data_source_scopes>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>

* client_id should be OAuth client_id of BigQuery DTS API for the given
  data source returned by ListDataSources method.
* data_source_scopes are the scopes returned by ListDataSources method.
* redirect_uri is an optional parameter. If not specified, then
  authorization code is posted to the opener of authorization flow window.
  Otherwise it will be sent to the redirect uri. A special value of
  urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob means that authorization code should be
  returned in the title bar of the browser, with the page text prompting
  the user to copy the code and paste it in the application.
  updateMask: string, Required list of fields to be updated in this request.
  versionInfo: string, Optional version info. If users want to find a very recent access token,
that is, immediately after approving access, users have to set the
version_info claim in the token request. To obtain the version_info, users
must use the “none+gsession” response type. which be return a
version_info back in the authorization response which be be put in a JWT
claim in the token request.
