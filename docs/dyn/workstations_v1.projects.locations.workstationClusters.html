{ # A workstation cluster resource in the Cloud Workstations API. Defines a group of workstations in a particular region and the VPC network they&#x27;re attached to.
  &quot;annotations&quot;: { # Optional. Client-specified annotations.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;conditions&quot;: [ # Output only. Status conditions describing the workstation cluster&#x27;s current state.
    { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
      &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

        },
      ],
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
    },
  ],
  &quot;controlPlaneIp&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The private IP address of the control plane for this workstation cluster. Workstation VMs need access to this IP address to work with the service, so make sure that your firewall rules allow egress from the workstation VMs to this address.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when this workstation cluster was created.
  &quot;degraded&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Whether this workstation cluster is in degraded mode, in which case it may require user action to restore full functionality. Details can be found in conditions.

  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Human-readable name for this workstation cluster.
  &quot;domainConfig&quot;: { # Configuration options for a custom domain. # Optional. Configuration options for a custom domain.
    &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Domain used by Workstations for HTTP ingress.
  },
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Checksum computed by the server. May be sent on update and delete requests to make sure that the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. [Labels](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/label-resources) that are applied to the workstation cluster and that are also propagated to the underlying Compute Engine resources.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. Full name of this workstation cluster.
  &quot;network&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Name of the Compute Engine network in which instances associated with this workstation cluster will be created.
  &quot;privateClusterConfig&quot;: { # Configuration options for private workstation clusters. # Optional. Configuration for private workstation cluster.
    &quot;allowedProjects&quot;: [ # Optional. Additional projects that are allowed to attach to the workstation cluster&#x27;s service attachment. By default, the workstation cluster&#x27;s project and the VPC host project (if different) are allowed.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;clusterHostname&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Hostname for the workstation cluster. This field will be populated only when private endpoint is enabled. To access workstations in the workstation cluster, create a new DNS zone mapping this domain name to an internal IP address and a forwarding rule mapping that address to the service attachment.
    &quot;enablePrivateEndpoint&quot;: True or False, # Immutable. Whether Workstations endpoint is private.
    &quot;serviceAttachmentUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Service attachment URI for the workstation cluster. The service attachemnt is created when private endpoint is enabled. To access workstations in the workstation cluster, configure access to the managed service using [Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services).
  },
  &quot;reconciling&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Indicates whether this workstation cluster is currently being updated to match its intended state.
  &quot;subnetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Immutable. Name of the Compute Engine subnetwork in which instances associated with this workstation cluster will be created. Must be part of the subnetwork specified for this workstation cluster.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. A system-assigned unique identifier for this workstation cluster.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time when this workstation cluster was most recently updated.
}

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set, and the workstation cluster is not found, a new workstation cluster will be created. In this situation, update_mask is ignored.
  updateMask: string, Required. Mask that specifies which fields in the workstation cluster should be updated.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, validate the request and preview the review, but do not actually apply it.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
