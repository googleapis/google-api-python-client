    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists DeployPolicies in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent, which owns this collection of deploy policies. Format must be `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_name}`. (required)
  filter: string, Filter deploy policies to be returned. See https://google.aip.dev/160 for more details. All fields can be used in the filter.
  orderBy: string, Field to sort by. See https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering for more details.
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of deploy policies to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 50 deploy policies will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be set to 1000.
  pageToken: string, A page token, received from a previous `ListDeployPolicies` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other provided parameters match the call that provided the page token.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response object from `ListDeployPolicies`.
  &quot;deployPolicies&quot;: [ # The `DeployPolicy` objects.
    { # A `DeployPolicy` resource in the Cloud Deploy API. A `DeployPolicy` inhibits manual or automation driven actions within a Delivery Pipeline or Target.

If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots(`.`), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set to true, updating a `DeployPolicy` that does not exist will result in the creation of a new `DeployPolicy`.

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server knows to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten by the update in the `DeployPolicy` resource. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it&#x27;s in the mask. If the user doesn&#x27;t provide a mask then all fields are overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set to true, the request is validated and the user is provided with an expected result, but no actual change is made.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
