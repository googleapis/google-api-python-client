<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(projectId, region, jobId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the job from the project. If the job is active, the delete fails, and the response returns FAILED_PRECONDITION.

Args:
  projectId: string, Required. The ID of the Google Cloud Platform project that the job belongs to. (required)
  region: string, Required. The Dataproc region in which to handle the request. (required)
  jobId: string, Required. The job ID. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      # service Foo {
      #   rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      # }
      # The JSON representation for Empty is empty JSON object {}.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds one or more members to a single role. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.Optionally, a binding can specify a condition, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.JSON example:
