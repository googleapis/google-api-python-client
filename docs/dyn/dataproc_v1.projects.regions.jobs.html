    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds one or more members, or principals, to a single role. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).JSON example: { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } YAML example: bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the bindings grant 50 different roles to user:alice@example.com, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the bindings in the Policy.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See Resource names (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds one or more members, or principals, to a single role. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).JSON example: { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } YAML example: bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the IAM documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/). # REQUIRED: The complete policy to be applied to the resource.
