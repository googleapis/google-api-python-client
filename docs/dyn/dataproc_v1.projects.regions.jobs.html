If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.

{ # Request message for TestIamPermissions method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the resource. Permissions with wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more information see IAM Overview (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }
