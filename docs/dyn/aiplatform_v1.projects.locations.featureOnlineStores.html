    &quot;privateServiceConnectConfig&quot;: { # Represents configuration for private service connect. # Optional. Private service connect config. The private service connection is available only for Optimized storage type, not for embedding management now. If PrivateServiceConnectConfig.enable_private_service_connect set to true, customers will use private service connection to send request. Otherwise, the connection will set to public endpoint.
      &quot;enablePrivateServiceConnect&quot;: True or False, # Required. If true, expose the IndexEndpoint via private service connect.
      &quot;projectAllowlist&quot;: [ # A list of Projects from which the forwarding rule will target the service attachment.

    &quot;serviceAttachment&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The name of the service attachment resource. Populated if private service connect is enabled and after FeatureViewSync is created.
  },
  &quot;encryptionSpec&quot;: { # Represents a customer-managed encryption key spec that can be applied to a top-level resource. # Optional. Customer-managed encryption key spec for data storage. If set, online store will be secured by this key.
    &quot;kmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer managed encryption key used to protect a resource. Has the form: `projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key`. The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created.
  },
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Used to perform consistent read-modify-write updates. If not set, a blind &quot;overwrite&quot; update happens.
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your FeatureOnlineStore. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels. No more than 64 user labels can be associated with one FeatureOnlineStore(System labels are excluded).&quot; System reserved label keys are prefixed with &quot;aiplatform.googleapis.com/&quot; and are immutable.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. Name of the FeatureOnlineStore. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/featureOnlineStores/{featureOnlineStore}`
  &quot;optimized&quot;: { # Optimized storage type # Contains settings for the Optimized store that will be created to serve featureValues for all FeatureViews under this FeatureOnlineStore. When choose Optimized storage type, need to set PrivateServiceConnectConfig.enable_private_service_connect to use private endpoint. Otherwise will use public endpoint by default.
  },
  &quot;satisfiesPzi&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Reserved for future use.
  &quot;satisfiesPzs&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Reserved for future use.

  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Timestamp when this FeatureOnlineStore was last updated.
}

  updateMask: string, Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the FeatureOnlineStore resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then only the non-empty fields present in the request will be overwritten. Set the update_mask to `*` to override all fields. Updatable fields: * `labels` * `description` * `bigtable` * `bigtable.auto_scaling` * `bigtable.enable_multi_region_replica`
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
