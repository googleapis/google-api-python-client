  automationId: string, Required. ID of the `Automation`.
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server knows to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

In other words, it must match the following regex: `^[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$`.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
  &quot;selector&quot;: { # AutomationResourceSelector contains the information to select the resources to which an Automation is going to be applied. # Required. Selected resources to which the automation will be applied.
    &quot;targets&quot;: [ # Contains attributes about a target.
      { # Contains criteria for selecting Targets.
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # ID of the `Target`. The value of this field could be one of the following: * The last segment of a target name * &quot;*&quot;, all targets in a location
        &quot;labels&quot;: { # Target labels.
          &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;serviceAccount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Email address of the user-managed IAM service account that creates Cloud Deploy release and rollout resources.
  &quot;suspended&quot;: True or False, # Optional. When Suspended, automation is deactivated from execution.
  &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Unique identifier of the `Automation`.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Time at which the automation was updated.
}

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set to true, updating a `Automation` that does not exist will result in the creation of a new `Automation`.
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server knows to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten by the update in the `Automation` resource. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it&#x27;s in the mask. If the user doesn&#x27;t provide a mask then all fields are overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set to true, the request is validated and the user is provided with an expected result, but no actual change is made.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
