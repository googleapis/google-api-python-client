      { # Defines a query on a resource.
        &quot;query&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Query that determines the memberships of the dynamic group. Examples: All users with at least one `organizations.department` of engineering. `user.organizations.exists(org, org.department==&#x27;engineering&#x27;)` All users with at least one location that has `area` of `foo` and `building_id` of `bar`. `user.locations.exists(loc, loc.area==&#x27;foo&#x27; &amp;&amp; loc.building_id==&#x27;bar&#x27;)` All users with any variation of the name John Doe (case-insensitive queries add `equalsIgnoreCase()` to the value being queried). `user.name.value.equalsIgnoreCase(&#x27;jOhn DoE&#x27;)`

  },
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Required. One or more label entries that apply to the Group. Currently supported labels contain a key with an empty value.
