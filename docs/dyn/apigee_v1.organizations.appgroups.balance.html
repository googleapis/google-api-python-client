Args:
  name: string, Required. Account balance for the AppGroup. Use the following structure in your request: `organizations/{org}/appgroups/{app_group}/balance` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for AdjustAppGroupBalance.
  &quot;adjustment&quot;: { # Represents an amount of money with its currency type. # Required. * A positive value of `adjustment` means that that the API provider wants to adjust the balance for an under-charged AppGroup i.e. the balance of the AppGroup will decrease. * A negative value of `adjustment` is not supported. Use credit balance API instead.
    &quot;currencyCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The three-letter currency code defined in ISO 4217.
    &quot;nanos&quot;: 42, # Number of nano (10^-9) units of the amount. The value must be between -999,999,999 and +999,999,999 inclusive. If `units` is positive, `nanos` must be positive or zero. If `units` is zero, `nanos` can be positive, zero, or negative. If `units` is negative, `nanos` must be negative or zero. For example $-1.75 is represented as `units`=-1 and `nanos`=-750,000,000.
    &quot;units&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The whole units of the amount. For example if `currencyCode` is `&quot;USD&quot;`, then 1 unit is one US dollar.
