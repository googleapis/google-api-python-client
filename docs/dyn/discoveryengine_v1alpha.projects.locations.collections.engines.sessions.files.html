<div class="method">

  <pre>Lists metadata for all files in the current session.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The resource name of the Session. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection}/engines/{engine}/sessions/{session}` Name of the session resource to which the file belong. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. The filter syntax consists of an expression language for constructing a predicate from one or more fields of the files being filtered. Filter expression is case-sensitive. Currently supported field names are: * upload_time * last_add_time * last_use_time * file_name * mime_type Some examples of filters would be: * &quot;file_name = &#x27;file_1&#x27;&quot; * &quot;file_name = &#x27;file_1&#x27; AND mime_type = &#x27;text/plain&#x27;&quot; * &quot;last_use_time &gt; &#x27;2025-06-14T12:00:00Z&#x27;&quot; For a full description of the filter format, please see https://google.aip.dev/160.
  orderBy: string, Optional. Specifies the order in which files are returned. The value is a comma-separated string of fields to sort by. For ascending order - just the field name is used. For descending order - the field name is suffixed with ` desc`. Sorting is stable and applied sequentially according to the order of fields provided in the string. Supported fields for ordering: * `upload_time`: The time the file was uploaded. * `file_name`: The name of the file. * `mime_type`: The MIME type of the file. * `session_name`: The name of the session the file belongs to. Default Behavior: If the `order_by` field is not specified, files will be returned sorted by creation time in descending order. Examples: 1. Sort by file name in ascending order: `file_name` 2. Sort by upload time in descending order: `upload_time desc` 3. Sort by file name (ascending), then by content type (MIME type) (descending), and finally by upload time (ascending): `file_name, mime_type desc, upload_time`
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of files to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 files will be returned. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000. If user specifies a value less than or equal to 0 - the request will be rejected with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A page token received from a previous `ListFiles` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListFiles` must match the call that provided the page token (except `page_size`, which may differ).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for SessionService.ListFiles method.
  &quot;files&quot;: [ # The FileMetadatas.
    { # Represents a file attached to a session (context file)
      &quot;byteSize&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The size of the context file in bytes.
      &quot;downloadUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The AssistantService.DownloadSessionFile URL to download the file. This URL will need the same credentials as AssistantService.ListSessionFileMetadata method and will provide the resource.
      &quot;fileId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The ID of the file.
      &quot;fileOriginType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The origin of the file.
      &quot;lastAddTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the file was added to the session. Note that if a file was added, then modified externally, then added again, the add time will be updated.
      &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Optional. Represents metadata related to the file that can suit particular use cases. The prefix &quot;google.&quot; is reserved for the key for use by Google, but other prefixes can be freely used.
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
      },
      &quot;mimeType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The content type of the file, see https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml.

      &quot;originalUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The original location of the file. It may be a local file path, or any other URI that allows accessing the file in an external system. There are two scenarios in which this url may be empty: 1. If the file was sent as inline data (e.g. pasted from the clipboard). 2. If the original location is not available. Note that there&#x27;s no guarantee that the URI will be pointing to a valid or actually existing file. For example, a file might have been uploaded to the session, and then deleted from the original source.
      &quot;uploadTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time the file was uploaded (If this is a file generated by an internal process and then made available to the session, this indicates the moment it happened).
