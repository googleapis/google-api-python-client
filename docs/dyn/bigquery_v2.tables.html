    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(projectId, datasetId, tableId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the table specified by tableId from the dataset. If the table contains data, all the data will be deleted.

Args:
  projectId: string, Required. Project ID of the table to delete (required)
  datasetId: string, Required. Dataset ID of the table to delete (required)
  tableId: string, Required. Table ID of the table to delete (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(projectId, datasetId, tableId, selectedFields=None, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the specified table resource by table ID. This method does not return the data in the table, it only returns the table resource, which describes the structure of this table.

Args:
  projectId: string, Required. Project ID of the requested table (required)
  datasetId: string, Required. Dataset ID of the requested table (required)
  tableId: string, Required. Table ID of the requested table (required)
  selectedFields: string, List of table schema fields to return (comma-separated). If unspecified, all fields are returned. A fieldMask cannot be used here because the fields will automatically be converted from camelCase to snake_case and the conversion will fail if there are underscores. Since these are fields in BigQuery table schemas, underscores are allowed.
  view: string, Optional. Specifies the view that determines which table information is returned. By default, basic table information and storage statistics (STORAGE_STATS) are returned.
    Allowed values
      TABLE_METADATA_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - The default value. Default to the STORAGE_STATS view.
      BASIC - Includes basic table information including schema and partitioning specification. This view does not include storage statistics such as numRows or numBytes. This view is significantly more efficient and should be used to support high query rates.
      STORAGE_STATS - Includes all information in the BASIC view as well as storage statistics (numBytes, numLongTermBytes, numRows and lastModifiedTime).
      FULL - Includes all table information, including storage statistics. It returns same information as STORAGE_STATS view, but may contain additional information in the future.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

      &quot;columnFamilies&quot;: [ # Optional. List of column families to expose in the table schema along with their types. This list restricts the column families that can be referenced in queries and specifies their value types. You can use this list to do type conversions - see the &#x27;type&#x27; field for more details. If you leave this list empty, all column families are present in the table schema and their values are read as BYTES. During a query only the column families referenced in that query are read from Bigtable.
        { # Information related to a Bigtable column family.
          &quot;columns&quot;: [ # Optional. Lists of columns that should be exposed as individual fields as opposed to a list of (column name, value) pairs.

              &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The encoding of the values when the type is not STRING. Acceptable encoding values are: TEXT - indicates values are alphanumeric text strings. BINARY - indicates values are encoded using HBase Bytes.toBytes family of functions. &#x27;encoding&#x27; can also be set at the column family level. However, the setting at this level takes precedence if &#x27;encoding&#x27; is set at both levels.
              &quot;fieldName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. If the qualifier is not a valid BigQuery field identifier i.e. does not match a-zA-Z*, a valid identifier must be provided as the column field name and is used as field name in queries.
              &quot;onlyReadLatest&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If this is set, only the latest version of value in this column are exposed. &#x27;onlyReadLatest&#x27; can also be set at the column family level. However, the setting at this level takes precedence if &#x27;onlyReadLatest&#x27; is set at both levels.
              &quot;qualifierEncoded&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Required] Qualifier of the column. Columns in the parent column family that has this exact qualifier are exposed as `.` field. If the qualifier is valid UTF-8 string, it can be specified in the qualifier_string field. Otherwise, a base-64 encoded value must be set to qualifier_encoded. The column field name is the same as the column qualifier. However, if the qualifier is not a valid BigQuery field identifier i.e. does not match a-zA-Z*, a valid identifier must be provided as field_name.

The values are expected to be encoded using HBase Bytes.toBytes function when using the BINARY encoding value. Following BigQuery types are allowed (case-sensitive): * BYTES * STRING * INTEGER * FLOAT * BOOLEAN * JSON Default type is BYTES. &#x27;type&#x27; can also be set at the column family level. However, the setting at this level takes precedence if &#x27;type&#x27; is set at both levels.
            },
          ],
          &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The encoding of the values when the type is not STRING. Acceptable encoding values are: TEXT - indicates values are alphanumeric text strings. BINARY - indicates values are encoded using HBase Bytes.toBytes family of functions. This can be overridden for a specific column by listing that column in &#x27;columns&#x27; and specifying an encoding for it.
          &quot;familyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier of the column family.
          &quot;onlyReadLatest&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If this is set only the latest version of value are exposed for all columns in this column family.

          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The type to convert the value in cells of this column family. The values are expected to be encoded using HBase Bytes.toBytes function when using the BINARY encoding value. Following BigQuery types are allowed (case-sensitive): * BYTES * STRING * INTEGER * FLOAT * BOOLEAN * JSON Default type is BYTES. This can be overridden for a specific column by listing that column in &#x27;columns&#x27; and specifying a type for it.
        },
      ],
      &quot;ignoreUnspecifiedColumnFamilies&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If field is true, then the column families that are not specified in columnFamilies list are not exposed in the table schema. Otherwise, they are read with BYTES type values. The default value is false.
      &quot;outputColumnFamiliesAsJson&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If field is true, then each column family will be read as a single JSON column. Otherwise they are read as a repeated cell structure containing timestamp/value tuples. The default value is false.
      &quot;readRowkeyAsString&quot;: True or False, # Optional. If field is true, then the rowkey column families will be read and converted to string. Otherwise they are read with BYTES type values and users need to manually cast them with CAST if necessary. The default value is false.
    },
    &quot;compression&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups, Avro, ORC and Parquet formats. An empty string is an invalid value.
    &quot;connectionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The connection specifying the credentials to be used to read external storage, such as Azure Blob, Cloud Storage, or S3. The connection_id can have the form `{project_id}.{location_id};{connection_id}` or `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/connections/{connection_id}`.
    &quot;csvOptions&quot;: { # Information related to a CSV data source. # Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set to CSV.
      &quot;allowJaggedRows&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.
      &quot;allowQuotedNewlines&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.
      &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
      &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
    },
    &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;fileSetSpecType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for constructing the file set to load. By default source URIs are expanded against the underlying storage. Other options include specifying manifest files. Only applicable to object storage systems.
    &quot;googleSheetsOptions&quot;: { # Options specific to Google Sheets data sources. # Optional. Additional options if sourceFormat is set to GOOGLE_SHEETS.
      &quot;range&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: sheet_name!top_left_cell_id:bottom_right_cell_id For example: sheet1!A1:B20
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data.

CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.
  &quot;options&quot;: { # Encapsulates settings provided to GetIamPolicy. # OPTIONAL: A `GetPolicyOptions` object for specifying options to `GetIamPolicy`.
    &quot;requestedPolicyVersion&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1.

  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`.

If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.

      &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
      &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
    },
    &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

The following modes are supported: * AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). * STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.

CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

Values of this NUMERIC or BIGNUMERIC field must be in this range when: * Precision (P) and scale (S) are specified: [-10P-S + 10-S, 10P-S - 10-S] * Precision (P) is specified but not scale (and thus scale is interpreted to be equal to zero): [-10P + 1, 10P - 1]. Acceptable values for precision and scale if both are specified: * If type = &quot;NUMERIC&quot;: 1 ≤ precision - scale ≤ 29 and 0 ≤ scale ≤ 9. * If type = &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;: 1 ≤ precision - scale ≤ 38 and 0 ≤ scale ≤ 38. Acceptable values for precision if only precision is specified but not scale (and thus scale is interpreted to be equal to zero): * If type = &quot;NUMERIC&quot;: 1 ≤ precision ≤ 29. * If type = &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;: 1 ≤ precision ≤ 38. If scale is specified but not precision, then it is invalid.

      &quot;allowJaggedRows&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.

The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
      &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

    &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.

Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
      &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

The connection_id can have the form `{project_id}.{location_id};{connection_id}` or `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/connections/{connection_id}`.
    &quot;csvOptions&quot;: { # Information related to a CSV data source. # Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set to CSV.
      &quot;allowJaggedRows&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.
      &quot;allowQuotedNewlines&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.
      &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
      &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
    },
    &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;fileSetSpecType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for constructing the file set to load.

      &quot;range&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: sheet_name!top_left_cell_id:bottom_right_cell_id For example: sheet1!A1:B20
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
    },
    &quot;hivePartitioningOptions&quot;: { # Options for configuring hive partitioning detect. # Optional. When set, configures hive partitioning support.

The following modes are supported: * AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). * STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.
      &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: false, # Optional. If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
      &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored. ORC: This setting is ignored. Parquet: This setting is ignored.

      &quot;allowJaggedRows&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.
      &quot;allowQuotedNewlines&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.
      &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
      &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

    &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
      &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
      &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
    },
    &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;fileSetSpecType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for constructing the file set to load.

      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

The following modes are supported: * AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). * STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.
      &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: false, # Optional. If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
      &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

    &quot;csvOptions&quot;: { # Information related to a CSV data source. # Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set to CSV.
      &quot;allowJaggedRows&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.
      &quot;allowQuotedNewlines&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.
      &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (&quot;,&quot;, U+002C).
      &quot;nullMarker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify &quot;\N&quot;, BigQuery interprets &quot;\N&quot; as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.
      &quot;preserveAsciiControlCharacters&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from &#x27;\x00&#x27; to &#x27;\x1F&#x27;) are preserved.
      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&quot;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character &#x27; &quot; &#x27;, use &#x27; &quot;&quot; &#x27;.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
    },
    &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; * (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); * (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); * (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

All types are strings. * CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.

Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with require_partition_filter explicitly set to true will fail.
      &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout: gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING} would all be valid source URI prefixes.

    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The supported types are DAY, HOUR, MONTH, and YEAR, which will generate one partition per day, hour, month, and year, respectively.
  },
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Describes the table type. The following values are supported: * `TABLE`: A normal BigQuery table. * `VIEW`: A virtual table defined by a SQL query. * `EXTERNAL`: A table that references data stored in an external storage system, such as Google Cloud Storage. * `MATERIALIZED_VIEW`: A precomputed view defined by a SQL query. * `SNAPSHOT`: An immutable BigQuery table that preserves the contents of a base table at a particular time. See additional information on [table snapshots](/bigquery/docs/table-snapshots-intro). The default value is `TABLE`.
  &quot;view&quot;: { # Describes the definition of a logical view. # Optional. The view definition.
    &quot;foreignDefinitions&quot;: [ # Optional. Foreign view representations.
      { # A view can be represented in multiple ways. Each representation has its own dialect. This message stores the metadata required for these representations.
        &quot;dialect&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Represents the dialect of the query.
        &quot;query&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The query that defines the view.
      },
    ],
    &quot;privacyPolicy&quot;: { # Represents privacy policy that contains the privacy requirements specified by the data owner. Currently, this is only supported on views. # Optional. Specifices the privacy policy for the view.
      &quot;aggregationThresholdPolicy&quot;: { # Represents privacy policy associated with &quot;aggregation threshold&quot; method. # Optional. Policy used for aggregation thresholds.
        &quot;privacyUnitColumns&quot;: [ # Optional. The privacy unit column(s) associated with this policy. For now, only one column per data source object (table, view) is allowed as a privacy unit column. Representing as a repeated field in metadata for extensibility to multiple columns in future. Duplicates and Repeated struct fields are not allowed. For nested fields, use dot notation (&quot;outer.inner&quot;)
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;threshold&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The threshold for the &quot;aggregation threshold&quot; policy.
      },
      &quot;differentialPrivacyPolicy&quot;: { # Represents privacy policy associated with &quot;differential privacy&quot; method. # Optional. Policy used for differential privacy.
        &quot;deltaBudget&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. The total delta budget for all queries against the privacy-protected view. Each subscriber query against this view charges the amount of delta that is pre-defined by the contributor through the privacy policy delta_per_query field. If there is sufficient budget, then the subscriber query attempts to complete. It might still fail due to other reasons, in which case the charge is refunded. If there is insufficient budget the query is rejected. There might be multiple charge attempts if a single query references multiple views. In this case there must be sufficient budget for all charges or the query is rejected and charges are refunded in best effort. The budget does not have a refresh policy and can only be updated via ALTER VIEW or circumvented by creating a new view that can be queried with a fresh budget.
        &quot;deltaBudgetRemaining&quot;: 3.14, # Output only. The delta budget remaining. If budget is exhausted, no more queries are allowed. Note that the budget for queries that are in progress is deducted before the query executes. If the query fails or is cancelled then the budget is refunded. In this case the amount of budget remaining can increase.
        &quot;deltaPerQuery&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. The delta value that is used per query. Delta represents the probability that any row will fail to be epsilon differentially private. Indicates the risk associated with exposing aggregate rows in the result of a query.
        &quot;epsilonBudget&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. The total epsilon budget for all queries against the privacy-protected view. Each subscriber query against this view charges the amount of epsilon they request in their query. If there is sufficient budget, then the subscriber query attempts to complete. It might still fail due to other reasons, in which case the charge is refunded. If there is insufficient budget the query is rejected. There might be multiple charge attempts if a single query references multiple views. In this case there must be sufficient budget for all charges or the query is rejected and charges are refunded in best effort. The budget does not have a refresh policy and can only be updated via ALTER VIEW or circumvented by creating a new view that can be queried with a fresh budget.
        &quot;epsilonBudgetRemaining&quot;: 3.14, # Output only. The epsilon budget remaining. If budget is exhausted, no more queries are allowed. Note that the budget for queries that are in progress is deducted before the query executes. If the query fails or is cancelled then the budget is refunded. In this case the amount of budget remaining can increase.
        &quot;maxEpsilonPerQuery&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. The maximum epsilon value that a query can consume. If the subscriber specifies epsilon as a parameter in a SELECT query, it must be less than or equal to this value. The epsilon parameter controls the amount of noise that is added to the groups — a higher epsilon means less noise.
        &quot;maxGroupsContributed&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The maximum groups contributed value that is used per query. Represents the maximum number of groups to which each protected entity can contribute. Changing this value does not improve or worsen privacy. The best value for accuracy and utility depends on the query and data.
        &quot;privacyUnitColumn&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The privacy unit column associated with this policy. Differential privacy policies can only have one privacy unit column per data source object (table, view).
      },
      &quot;joinRestrictionPolicy&quot;: { # Represents privacy policy associated with &quot;join restrictions&quot;. Join restriction gives data providers the ability to enforce joins on the &#x27;join_allowed_columns&#x27; when data is queried from a privacy protected view. # Optional. Join restriction policy is outside of the one of policies, since this policy can be set along with other policies. This policy gives data providers the ability to enforce joins on the &#x27;join_allowed_columns&#x27; when data is queried from a privacy protected view.
        &quot;joinAllowedColumns&quot;: [ # Optional. The only columns that joins are allowed on. This field is must be specified for join_conditions JOIN_ANY and JOIN_ALL and it cannot be set for JOIN_BLOCKED.
          &quot;A String&quot;,
        ],
        &quot;joinCondition&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Specifies if a join is required or not on queries for the view. Default is JOIN_CONDITION_UNSPECIFIED.
      },
    },
    &quot;query&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A query that BigQuery executes when the view is referenced.
    &quot;useExplicitColumnNames&quot;: True or False, # True if the column names are explicitly specified. For example by using the &#x27;CREATE VIEW v(c1, c2) AS ...&#x27; syntax. Can only be set for GoogleSQL views.
    &quot;useLegacySql&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to use BigQuery&#x27;s legacy SQL for this view. The default value is true. If set to false, the view will use BigQuery&#x27;s GoogleSQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ Queries and views that reference this view must use the same flag value. A wrapper is used here because the default value is True.
    &quot;userDefinedFunctionResources&quot;: [ # Describes user-defined function resources used in the query.
      { #  This is used for defining User Defined Function (UDF) resources only when using legacy SQL. Users of GoogleSQL should leverage either DDL (e.g. CREATE [TEMPORARY] FUNCTION ... ) or the Routines API to define UDF resources.

        &quot;inlineCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Pick one] An inline resource that contains code for a user-defined function (UDF). Providing a inline code resource is equivalent to providing a URI for a file containing the same code.
        &quot;resourceUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Pick one] A code resource to load from a Google Cloud Storage URI (gs://bucket/path).
