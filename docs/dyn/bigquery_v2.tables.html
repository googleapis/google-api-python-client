<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(projectId, datasetId, tableId)</code>
  <pre>Deletes the table specified by tableId from the dataset. If the table contains data, all the data will be deleted.

Args:
  projectId: string, Project ID of the table to delete (required)
  datasetId: string, Dataset ID of the table to delete (required)
  tableId: string, Table ID of the table to delete (required)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(projectId, datasetId, tableId, selectedFields=None, view=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the specified table resource by table ID. This method does not return the data in the table, it only returns the table resource, which describes the structure of this table.

Args:
  projectId: string, Project ID of the requested table (required)
  datasetId: string, Dataset ID of the requested table (required)
  tableId: string, Table ID of the requested table (required)
  selectedFields: string, List of fields to return (comma-separated). If unspecified, all fields are returned
  view: string, Specifies the view that determines which table information is returned. By default, basic table information and storage statistics (STORAGE_STATS) are returned.
    Allowed values
      BASIC - Includes basic table information including schema and partitioning specification. This view does not include storage statistics such as numRows or numBytes. This view is significantly more efficient and should be used to support high query rates.
      FULL - Includes all table information, including storage statistics. It returns same information as STORAGE_STATS view, but may contain additional information in the future.
      STORAGE_STATS - Includes all information in the BASIC view as well as storage statistics (numBytes, numLongTermBytes, numRows and lastModifiedTime).
      TABLE_METADATA_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - The default value. Default to the STORAGE_STATS view.

    &quot;csvOptions&quot;: { # Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set to CSV.
      &quot;allowJaggedRows&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.
      &quot;allowQuotedNewlines&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.
      &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (&#x27;,&#x27;).
      &quot;null_marker&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] An custom string that will represent a NULL value in CSV import data.

      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
    },
    &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # [Optional] Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;googleSheetsOptions&quot;: { # [Optional] Additional options if sourceFormat is set to GOOGLE_SHEETS.
      &quot;range&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] Range of a sheet to query from. Only used when non-empty. Typical format: sheet_name!top_left_cell_id:bottom_right_cell_id For example: sheet1!A1:B20
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a sheet that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

      &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. The following modes are supported. (1) AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). (2) STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are interpreted as strings. (3) CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.
      &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with requirePartitionFilter explicitly set to true will fail.
      &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-01-01/country=BR/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2018-12-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/ (trailing slash does not matter).
    },

If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.
    &quot;maxBadRecords&quot;: 42, # [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.
  &quot;options&quot;: { # Encapsulates settings provided to GetIamPolicy. # OPTIONAL: A `GetPolicyOptions` object for specifying options to `GetIamPolicy`.
    &quot;requestedPolicyVersion&quot;: 42, # Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC.

BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.

When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.

      &quot;encoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (&#x27;,&#x27;).

      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

    &quot;decimalTargetTypes&quot;: [ # [Optional] Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

This property is useful if you have header rows that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.

BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.

When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -&gt; NUMERIC; (39,9) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -&gt; BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;STRING&quot;] for ORC and [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;] for the other file formats.

If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;].

This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, [&quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;, &quot;NUMERIC&quot;] is the same as [&quot;NUMERIC&quot;, &quot;BIGNUMERIC&quot;] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC.
