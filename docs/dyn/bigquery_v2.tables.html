BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence &quot;\t&quot; to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (&#x27;,&#x27;).
      &quot;quote&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;, # [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote (&#x27;&quot;&#x27;). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
      &quot;skipLeadingRows&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

When autodetect is on, behavior is the following: * skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. * skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row. * skipLeadingRows = N &gt; 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

      &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when reading data. The following modes are supported. (1) AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). (2) STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are interpreted as strings. (3) CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported types include: AVRO, CSV, JSON, ORC and Parquet.
      &quot;requirePartitionFilter&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table. Hive-partitioned loads with requirePartitionFilter explicitly set to true will fail.
      &quot;sourceUriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris should be supplied. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-01-01/country=BR/id=7/file.avro gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2018-12-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/ (trailing slash does not matter).
    },
    &quot;ignoreUnknownValues&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don&#x27;t match any column names Google Cloud Bigtable: This setting is ignored. Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored. Avro: This setting is ignored.
    &quot;maxBadRecords&quot;: 42, # [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. This is only valid for CSV, JSON, and Google Sheets. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Datastore backups and Avro formats.
    &quot;parquetOptions&quot;: { # Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set to Parquet.
      &quot;enableListInference&quot;: True or False, # [Optional] Indicates whether to use schema inference specifically for Parquet LIST logical type.

A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

      &quot;fieldDelimiter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.

  &quot;policy&quot;: { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.
