<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(projectId, datasetId, tableId, body)</code>
  <pre>Updates information in an existing table. The update method replaces the entire table resource, whereas the patch method only replaces fields that are provided in the submitted table resource.

Args:
  projectId: string, Project ID of the table to update (required)
  datasetId: string, Dataset ID of the table to update (required)
  tableId: string, Table ID of the table to update (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "kind": "bigquery#table", # [Output-only] The type of the resource.
    "lastModifiedTime": "A String", # [Output-only] The time when this table was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch.
    "description": "A String", # [Optional] A user-friendly description of this table.
    "creationTime": "A String", # [Output-only] The time when this table was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.
    "externalDataConfiguration": { # [Optional] Describes the data format, location, and other properties of a table stored outside of BigQuery. By defining these properties, the data source can then be queried as if it were a standard BigQuery table.
      "compression": "A String", # [Optional] The compression type of the data source. Possible values include GZIP and NONE. The default value is NONE. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Datastore backups.
      "csvOptions": { # Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set to CSV.
        "fieldDelimiter": "A String", # [Optional] The separator for fields in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" to specify a tab separator. The default value is a comma (',').
        "encoding": "A String", # [Optional] The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.
        "skipLeadingRows": 42, # [Optional] The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
        "allowJaggedRows": True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.
        "quote": """, # [Optional] The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.
        "allowQuotedNewlines": True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.
      },
      "sourceFormat": "A String", # [Required] The data format. For CSV files, specify "CSV". For newline-delimited JSON, specify "NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON". For Google Cloud Datastore backups, specify "DATASTORE_BACKUP".
      "maxBadRecords": 42, # [Optional] The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when reading data. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This setting is ignored for Google Cloud Datastore backups.
      "ignoreUnknownValues": True or False, # [Optional] Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value: CSV: Trailing columns JSON: Named values that don't match any column names Google Cloud Datastore backups: This setting is ignored.
      "sourceUris": [ # [Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud Storage. Each URI can contain one '*' wildcard character and it must come after the 'bucket' name. Size limits related to load jobs apply to external data sources, plus an additional limit of 10 GB maximum size across all URIs. For Google Cloud Datastore backups, exactly one URI can be specified, and it must end with '.backup_info'. Also, the '*' wildcard character is not allowed.
