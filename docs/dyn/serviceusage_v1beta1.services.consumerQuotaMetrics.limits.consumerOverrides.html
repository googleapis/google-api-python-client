<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, force=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a consumer override.
A consumer override is applied to the consumer on its own authority to
limit its own quota usage. Consumer overrides cannot be used to grant more
quota than would be allowed by admin overrides, producer overrides, or the
default limit of the service.

Args:
  parent: string, The resource name of the parent quota limit, returned by a
ListConsumerQuotaMetrics or GetConsumerQuotaMetric call.

An example name would be:
`projects/123/services/compute.googleapis.com/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A quota override
  &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The limit unit of the limit to which this override applies.
      # 
      # An example unit would be:
      # `1/{project}/{region}`
      # Note that `{project}` and `{region}` are not placeholders in this example;
      # the literal characters `{` and `}` occur in the string.
  &quot;overrideValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The overriding quota limit value.
      # Can be any nonnegative integer, or -1 (unlimited quota).
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The resource name of the override.
      # This name is generated by the server when the override is created.
      # 
      # Example names would be:
      # `projects/123/services/compute.googleapis.com/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion/adminOverrides/4a3f2c1d`
      # `projects/123/services/compute.googleapis.com/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion/consumerOverrides/4a3f2c1d`
      # 
      # The resource name is intended to be opaque and should not be parsed for
      # its component strings, since its representation could change in the future.
  &quot;metric&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the metric to which this override applies.
      # 
      # An example name would be:
      # `compute.googleapis.com/cpus`
  &quot;dimensions&quot;: { # If this map is nonempty, then this override applies only to specific values
      # for dimensions defined in the limit unit.
      # 
      # For example, an override on a limit with the unit 1/{project}/{region}
      # could contain an entry with the key &quot;region&quot; and the value &quot;us-east-1&quot;;
      # the override is only applied to quota consumed in that region.
      # 
      # This map has the following restrictions:
      # 
      # *   Keys that are not defined in the limit&#x27;s unit are not valid keys.
      #     Any string appearing in {brackets} in the unit (besides {project} or
      #     {user}) is a defined key.
      # *   &quot;project&quot; is not a valid key; the project is already specified in
      #     the parent resource name.
      # *   &quot;user&quot; is not a valid key; the API does not support quota overrides
      #     that apply only to a specific user.
      # *   If &quot;region&quot; appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud region.
      # *   If &quot;zone&quot; appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud zone.
      # *   If any valid key other than &quot;region&quot; or &quot;zone&quot; appears in the map, then
      #     all valid keys other than &quot;region&quot; or &quot;zone&quot; must also appear in the
      #     map.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
}

  force: boolean, Whether to force the creation of the quota override.
If creating an override would cause the effective quota for the consumer to
decrease by more than 10 percent, the call is rejected, as a safety measure
to avoid accidentally decreasing quota too quickly. Setting the force
parameter to true ignores this restriction.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
