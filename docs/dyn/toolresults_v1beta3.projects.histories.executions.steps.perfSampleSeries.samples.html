    <code class="details" id="batchCreate">batchCreate(projectId, historyId, executionId, stepId, sampleSeriesId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a batch of PerfSamples - a client can submit multiple batches of Perf Samples through repeated calls to this method in order to split up a large request payload - duplicates and existing timestamp entries will be ignored. - the batch operation may partially succeed - the set of elements successfully inserted is returned in the response (omits items which already existed in the database). May return any of the following canonical error codes: - NOT_FOUND - The containing PerfSampleSeries does not exist

Args:
  projectId: string, The cloud project (required)
  historyId: string, A tool results history ID. (required)
  executionId: string, A tool results execution ID. (required)
  stepId: string, A tool results step ID. (required)
  sampleSeriesId: string, A sample series id (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request must provide up to a maximum of 5000 samples to be created; a larger sample size will cause an INVALID_ARGUMENT error
  &quot;perfSamples&quot;: [ # The set of PerfSamples to create should not include existing timestamps
    { # Resource representing a single performance measure or data point
      &quot;sampleTime&quot;: { # A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are &quot;smeared&quot; so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear). The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings. # Timestamp of collection.
        &quot;nanos&quot;: 42, # Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. Negative second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values that count forward in time. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.
        &quot;seconds&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Represents seconds of UTC time since Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Must be from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z inclusive.

    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
