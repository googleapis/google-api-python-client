May return any of the following canonical error codes: - NOT_FOUND - The containing PerfSampleSeries does not exist

The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required, though only UTC (as indicated by "Z") is presently supported.
            #
