<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(projectId, zone, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a cluster, consisting of the specified number and type of Google
Compute Engine instances.

By default, the cluster is created in the project's
[default network](/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks).

One firewall is added for the cluster. After cluster creation,
the Kubelet creates routes for each node to allow the containers
on that node to communicate with all other instances in the
cluster.

Finally, an entry is added to the project's global metadata indicating
which CIDR range the cluster is using.
