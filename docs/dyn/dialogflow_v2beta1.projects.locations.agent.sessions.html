  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request to detect user&#x27;s intent.
  &quot;inputAudio&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The natural language speech audio to be processed. This field should be populated iff `query_input` is set to an input audio config. A single request can contain up to 1 minute of speech audio data.

If this audio config is supplied in a request, it overrides all existing text-to-speech settings applied to the agent. # Instructs the speech synthesizer how to generate the output audio. If this field is not set and agent-level speech synthesizer is not configured, no output audio is generated.
    &quot;audioEncoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Audio encoding of the synthesized audio content.
    &quot;sampleRateHertz&quot;: 42, # The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on the audio encoding. If this is different from the voice&#x27;s natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality).
    &quot;synthesizeSpeechConfig&quot;: { # Configuration of how speech should be synthesized. # Configuration of how speech should be synthesized.
      &quot;effectsProfileId&quot;: [ # Optional. An identifier which selects &#x27;audio effects&#x27; profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given.

      ],
      &quot;pitch&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch.
      &quot;speakingRate&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values &lt; 0.25 or &gt; 4.0 will return an error.
      &quot;voice&quot;: { # Description of which voice to use for speech synthesis. # Optional. The desired voice of the synthesized audio.
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and ssml_gender. For the list of available voices, please refer to [Supported voices and languages](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).
        &quot;ssmlGender&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.
      },
      &quot;volumeGainDb&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there&#x27;s usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that.
    },
  },
  &quot;outputAudioConfigMask&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Mask for output_audio_config indicating which settings in this request-level config should override speech synthesizer settings defined at agent-level. If unspecified or empty, output_audio_config replaces the agent-level config in its entirety.

      &quot;enableWordInfo&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, Dialogflow returns SpeechWordInfo in StreamingRecognitionResult with information about the recognized speech words, e.g. start and end time offsets. If false or unspecified, Speech doesn&#x27;t return any word-level information.
      &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The language of the supplied audio. Dialogflow does not do translations. See [Language Support](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/reference/language) for a list of the currently supported language codes. Note that queries in the same session do not necessarily need to specify the same language.
      &quot;model&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Which Speech model to select for the given request. Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly specified, then we auto-select a model based on the parameters in the InputAudioConfig. If enhanced speech model is enabled for the agent and an enhanced version of the specified model for the language does not exist, then the speech is recognized using the standard version of the specified model.

      &quot;singleUtterance&quot;: True or False, # If `false` (default), recognition does not cease until the client closes the stream. If `true`, the recognizer will detect a single spoken utterance in input audio. Recognition ceases when it detects the audio&#x27;s voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once a detected intent is received, the client should close the stream and start a new request with a new stream as needed. Note: This setting is relevant only for streaming methods. Note: When specified, InputAudioConfig.single_utterance takes precedence over StreamingDetectIntentRequest.single_utterance.
      &quot;speechContexts&quot;: [ # Context information to assist speech recognition. See [the Cloud Speech documentation](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/basics#phrase-hints) for more details.

          &quot;boost&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Boost for this context compared to other contexts: * If the boost is positive, Dialogflow will increase the probability that the phrases in this context are recognized over similar sounding phrases. * If the boost is unspecified or non-positive, Dialogflow will not apply any boost. Dialogflow recommends that you use boosts in the range (0, 20] and that you find a value that fits your use case with binary search.
          &quot;phrases&quot;: [ # Optional. A list of strings containing words and phrases that the speech recognizer should recognize with higher likelihood. This list can be used to: * improve accuracy for words and phrases you expect the user to say, e.g. typical commands for your Dialogflow agent * add additional words to the speech recognizer vocabulary * ...

      { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).

If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).

Supported formats: - `projects//agent/sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//locations//agent/sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`, - `projects//locations//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`, The `Context ID` is always converted to lowercase, may only contain characters in a-zA-Z0-9_-% and may be at most 250 bytes long. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow.

Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`, and `user_defined` fields are all set.

        { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).

For Participants.DetectIntent, it needs to be configured in DetectIntentRequest.query_params. For Participants.StreamingDetectIntent, it needs to be configured in StreamingDetectIntentRequest.query_params. And for Participants.AnalyzeContent and Participants.StreamingAnalyzeContent, it needs to be configured in ConversationProfile.human_agent_assistant_config # The sentiment analysis result, which depends on the `sentiment_analysis_request_config` specified in the request.
      &quot;queryTextSentiment&quot;: { # The sentiment, such as positive/negative feeling or association, for a unit of analysis, such as the query text. # The sentiment analysis result for `query_text`.
        &quot;magnitude&quot;: 3.14, # A non-negative number in the [0, +inf) range, which represents the absolute magnitude of sentiment, regardless of score (positive or negative).
        &quot;score&quot;: 3.14, # Sentiment score between -1.0 (negative sentiment) and 1.0 (positive sentiment).
      },
    },
    &quot;speechRecognitionConfidence&quot;: 3.14, # The Speech recognition confidence between 0.0 and 1.0. A higher number indicates an estimated greater likelihood that the recognized words are correct. The default of 0.0 is a sentinel value indicating that confidence was not set. This field is not guaranteed to be accurate or set. In particular this field isn&#x27;t set for StreamingDetectIntent since the streaming endpoint has separate confidence estimates per portion of the audio in StreamingRecognitionResult.
    &quot;webhookPayload&quot;: { # If the query was fulfilled by a webhook call, this field is set to the value of the `payload` field returned in the webhook response.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object.
    },
    &quot;webhookSource&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If the query was fulfilled by a webhook call, this field is set to the value of the `source` field returned in the webhook response.
  },
  &quot;responseId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique identifier of the response. It can be used to locate a response in the training example set or for reporting issues.
  &quot;webhookStatus&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # Specifies the status of the webhook request.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
