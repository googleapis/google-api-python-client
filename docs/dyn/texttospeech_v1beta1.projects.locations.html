  <pre>Synthesizes long form text asynchronously.

Args:
  parent: string, The resource states of the request in the form of `projects/*/locations/*/voices/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The top-level message sent by the client for the `SynthesizeLongAudio` method.
  &quot;audioConfig&quot;: { # Description of audio data to be synthesized. # Required. The configuration of the synthesized audio.
    &quot;audioEncoding&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The format of the audio byte stream.
    &quot;effectsProfileId&quot;: [ # Optional. Input only. An identifier which selects &#x27;audio effects&#x27; profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. See [audio profiles](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/audio-profiles) for current supported profile ids.
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
    &quot;pitch&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Input only. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the original pitch.
    &quot;sampleRateHertz&quot;: 42, # Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. When this is specified in SynthesizeSpeechRequest, if this is different from the voice&#x27;s natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality), unless the specified sample rate is not supported for the encoding chosen, in which case it will fail the request and return google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
    &quot;speakingRate&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Input only. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values &lt; 0.25 or &gt; 4.0 will return an error.
    &quot;volumeGainDb&quot;: 3.14, # Optional. Input only. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. Strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there&#x27;s usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that.
  },
  &quot;input&quot;: { # Contains text input to be synthesized. Either `text` or `ssml` must be supplied. Supplying both or neither returns google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT. The input size is limited to 5000 bytes. # Required. The Synthesizer requires either plain text or SSML as input.
    &quot;ssml&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The SSML document to be synthesized. The SSML document must be valid and well-formed. Otherwise the RPC will fail and return google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT. For more information, see [SSML](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml).
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The raw text to be synthesized.
  },
  &quot;outputGcsUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies a Cloud Storage URI for the synthesis results. Must be specified in the format: `gs://bucket_name/object_name`, and the bucket must already exist.
  &quot;voice&quot;: { # Description of which voice to use for a synthesis request. # The desired voice of the synthesized audio.
    &quot;customVoice&quot;: { # Description of the custom voice to be synthesized. # The configuration for a custom voice. If [CustomVoiceParams.model] is set, the service will choose the custom voice matching the specified configuration.
      &quot;model&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the AutoML model that synthesizes the custom voice.
      &quot;reportedUsage&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The usage of the synthesized audio to be reported.
    },
    &quot;languageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The language (and potentially also the region) of the voice expressed as a [BCP-47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) language tag, e.g. &quot;en-US&quot;. This should not include a script tag (e.g. use &quot;cmn-cn&quot; rather than &quot;cmn-Hant-cn&quot;), because the script will be inferred from the input provided in the SynthesisInput. The TTS service will use this parameter to help choose an appropriate voice. Note that the TTS service may choose a voice with a slightly different language code than the one selected; it may substitute a different region (e.g. using en-US rather than en-CA if there isn&#x27;t a Canadian voice available), or even a different language, e.g. using &quot;nb&quot; (Norwegian Bokmal) instead of &quot;no&quot; (Norwegian)&quot;.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and gender.
    &quot;ssmlGender&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement; if a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.
  },
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
