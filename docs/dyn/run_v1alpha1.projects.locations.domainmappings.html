  <pre>Rpc to delete a domain mapping.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the domain mapping being deleted. If needed, replace
{namespace_id} with the project ID. (required)
  apiVersion: string, Cloud Run currently ignores this parameter.
  propagationPolicy: string, Specifies the propagation policy of delete. Cloud Run currently ignores
this setting, and deletes in the background. Please see
kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/ for
more information.
  kind: string, Cloud Run currently ignores this parameter.
  orphanDependents: boolean, Deprecated.
Specifies the cascade behavior on delete.
Cloud Run only supports cascading behavior, so this must be false.
This attribute is deprecated, and is now replaced with PropagationPolicy
