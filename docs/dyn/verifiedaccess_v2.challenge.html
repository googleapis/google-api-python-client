Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Result message for VerifiedAccess.GenerateChallenge.
  &quot;challenge&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Generated challenge, the bytes representation of SignedData.
}</pre>
</div>
