  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for the ReportService.Search method.

  &quot;pageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Token of the page to retrieve. If not specified, the first page of results is returned. In order to request the next page of results, the value obtained from `next_page_token` in the previous response should be used.
  &quot;query&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Query that defines performance metrics to retrieve and dimensions according to which the metrics are to be segmented. For details on how to construct your query, see the [Query Language guide](https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/guides/reports/query-language/overview).
