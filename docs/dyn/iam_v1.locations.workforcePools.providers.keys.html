  <pre>Creates a new WorkforcePoolProviderKey in a WorkforcePoolProvider.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The provider to create this key in. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;expireTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time after which the key will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. Note that the key may get purged before this time if the total limit of keys per provider is exceeded.
  &quot;keyData&quot;: { # Represents a public key data along with its format. # Immutable. Public half of the asymmetric key.
    &quot;format&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The format of the key.
    &quot;key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The key data. The format of the key is represented by the format field.
    &quot;keySpec&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The specifications for the key.
    &quot;notAfterTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Latest timestamp when this key is valid. Attempts to use this key after this time will fail. Only present if the key data represents a X.509 certificate.
    &quot;notBeforeTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Earliest timestamp when this key is valid. Attempts to use this key before this time will fail. Only present if the key data represents a X.509 certificate.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
