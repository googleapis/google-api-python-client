    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:

      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

If unspecified, at most 25 versions will be returned.
The maximum value is 100; values above 100 will be coerced to 100
  filter: string, The filter string used to return a subset of versions in the response.
Currently supported fields for filtering are: name, status,
