<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="clone">clone(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new version on the specified target site using the content of the specified version.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The target site for the cloned version, in the format: sites/ SITE_ID (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;exclude&quot;: { # A representation of filter path. # If provided, only paths that do not match any of the RegEx values in this list will be included in the new version.
    &quot;regexes&quot;: [ # An array of RegEx values by which to filter.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.

    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists the versions that have been created for the specified site. This list includes versions for both the default `live` channel and any active preview channels for the specified site.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The site or channel for which to list versions, in either of the following formats: - sites/SITE_ID - sites/SITE_ID/channels/CHANNEL_ID  (required)
  filter: string, A filter string used to return a subset of versions in the response. The currently supported fields for filtering are: `name`, `status`, and `create_time`. Learn more about filtering in Google&#x27;s [AIP 160 standard](https://google.aip.dev/160).
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of versions to return. The service may return a lower number if fewer versions exist than this maximum number. If unspecified, defaults to 25. The maximum value is 100; values above 100 will be coerced to 100.
  pageToken: string, A token from a previous call to `ListVersions` that tells the server where to resume listing.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
