    The object takes the form of:

{ # A request to aggregate one or more values.
  &quot;aggregations&quot;: [ # Array of aggregations to perform. Up to 25 aggregations can be defined.
    { # Message describing an aggregation. The message includes the aggregation type, parameters, and the field on which to perform the aggregation.
      &quot;count&quot;: { # Object count. # Count the number of matching objects.
      },
      &quot;field&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the field on which to aggregate.

        &quot;lowerBounds&quot;: [ # Lower bounds of buckets. The response will contain `n+1` buckets for `n` bounds. The first bucket will count all assets for which the field value is smaller than the first bound. Subsequent buckets will count assets for which the field value is greater or equal to a lower bound and smaller than the next one. The last bucket will count assets for which the field value is greater or equal to the final lower bound. You can define up to 20 lower bounds.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Deletes an asset.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the resource. (required)
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(name, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the details of an asset.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the resource. (required)
  view: string, View of the assets. Defaults to BASIC.
    Allowed values
      ASSET_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - The asset view is not specified. The API displays the basic view by default.
      ASSET_VIEW_BASIC - The asset view includes only basic metadata of the asset.
      ASSET_VIEW_FULL - The asset view includes all the metadata of an asset and performance data.

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `Asset` resource by the update. The values specified in the `update_mask` field are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. A single * value in the mask lets you to overwrite all fields.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

      1 - v1 error format
