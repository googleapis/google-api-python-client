<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="search">search(pageSize=None, pageToken=None, query=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Search cases using the specified query.

Args:
  pageSize: integer, The maximum number of cases fetched with each request. The default page size is 10.
  pageToken: string, A token identifying the page of results to return. If unspecified, the first page is retrieved.
  query: string, An expression written in filter language. A query uses the following fields with the operators equals (`=`) and `AND`: - `organization`: An organization name in the form `organizations/`. - `project`: A project name in the form `projects/`. - `state`: The accepted values are `OPEN` or `CLOSED`. - `priority`: The accepted values are `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, or `P4`. You can specify multiple values for priority using the `OR` operator. For example, `priority=P1 OR priority=P2`. - [DEPRECATED] `severity`: The accepted values are `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, `S3`, or `S4`. - `creator.email`: The email address of the case creator. - `billingAccount`: A billing account in the form `billingAccounts/` You must specify eitehr `organization` or `project`. To search across `displayName`, `description`, and comments, use a global restriction with no keyword or operator. For example, `&quot;my search&quot;`. To search only cases updated after a certain date, use `update_time` retricted with that particular date, time, and timezone in ISO datetime format. For example, `update_time&gt;&quot;2020-01-01T00:00:00-05:00&quot;`. `update_time` only supports the greater than operator (`&gt;`). Examples: - `organization=&quot;organizations/123456789&quot;` - `project=&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;` - `project=&quot;projects/123456789&quot;` - `billing_account=&quot;billingAccounts/123456-A0B0C0-CUZ789&quot;` - `organization=&quot;organizations/123456789&quot; AND state=CLOSED` - `project=&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot; AND creator.email=&quot;tester@example.com&quot;` - `project=&quot;projects/my-project-id&quot; AND (priority=P0 OR priority=P1)`
