Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent project/location in which to create the Kafka Connect cluster. Structured like `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.

      &quot;networkConfigs&quot;: [ # Required. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks that must be granted direct access to the Kafka Connect cluster. Minimum of 1 network is required. Maximum 10 networks can be specified.
        { # The configuration of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network that can access the Kafka Connect cluster.
          &quot;additionalSubnets&quot;: [ # Optional. Additional subnets may be specified. They may be in another region, but must be in the same VPC network. The Connect workers can communicate with network endpoints in either the primary or additional subnets.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;dnsDomainNames&quot;: [ # Optional. Additional DNS domain names from the subnet&#x27;s network to be made visible to the Connect Cluster. When using MirrorMaker2, it&#x27;s necessary to add the bootstrap address&#x27;s dns domain name of the target cluster to make it visible to the connector. For example: my-kafka-cluster.us-central1.managedkafka.my-project.cloud.goog
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;primarySubnet&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. VPC subnet to make available to the Kafka Connect cluster. Structured like: projects/{project}/regions/{region}/subnetworks/{subnet_id} It is used to create a Private Service Connect (PSC) interface for the Kafka Connect workers. It must be located in the same region as the Kafka Connect cluster. The CIDR range of the subnet must be within the IPv4 address ranges for private networks, as specified in RFC 1918. The primary subnet CIDR range must have a minimum size of /22 (1024 addresses).
        },
      ],
    },
    &quot;secretPaths&quot;: [ # Optional. Secrets to load into workers. Exact SecretVersions from Secret Manager must be provided -- aliases are not supported. Up to 32 secrets may be loaded into one cluster. Format: projects//secrets//versions/
      &quot;A String&quot;,

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID to avoid duplication of requests. If a request times out or fails, retrying with the same ID allows the server to recognize the previous attempt. For at least 60 minutes, the server ignores duplicate requests bearing the same ID. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID within 60 minutes of the last request, the server checks if an original operation with the same request ID was received. If so, the server ignores the second request. The request ID must be a valid UUID. A zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

{ # An Apache Kafka Connect cluster deployed in a location.
  &quot;capacityConfig&quot;: { # A capacity configuration of a Kafka cluster. # Required. Capacity configuration for the Kafka Connect cluster.
    &quot;memoryBytes&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The memory to provision for the cluster in bytes. The CPU:memory ratio (vCPU:GiB) must be between 1:1 and 1:8. Minimum: 3221225472 (3 GiB).
    &quot;vcpuCount&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The number of vCPUs to provision for the cluster. Minimum: 3.
  },
  &quot;config&quot;: { # Optional. Configurations for the worker that are overridden from the defaults. The key of the map is a Kafka Connect worker property name, for example: `exactly.once.source.support`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the cluster was created.
  &quot;gcpConfig&quot;: { # Configuration properties for a Kafka Connect cluster deployed to Google Cloud Platform. # Required. Configuration properties for a Kafka Connect cluster deployed to Google Cloud Platform.
    &quot;accessConfig&quot;: { # The configuration of access to the Kafka Connect cluster. # Required. Access configuration for the Kafka Connect cluster.
      &quot;networkConfigs&quot;: [ # Required. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks that must be granted direct access to the Kafka Connect cluster. Minimum of 1 network is required. Maximum 10 networks can be specified.
        { # The configuration of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network that can access the Kafka Connect cluster.
          &quot;additionalSubnets&quot;: [ # Optional. Additional subnets may be specified. They may be in another region, but must be in the same VPC network. The Connect workers can communicate with network endpoints in either the primary or additional subnets.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;dnsDomainNames&quot;: [ # Optional. Additional DNS domain names from the subnet&#x27;s network to be made visible to the Connect Cluster. When using MirrorMaker2, it&#x27;s necessary to add the bootstrap address&#x27;s dns domain name of the target cluster to make it visible to the connector. For example: my-kafka-cluster.us-central1.managedkafka.my-project.cloud.goog
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;primarySubnet&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. VPC subnet to make available to the Kafka Connect cluster. Structured like: projects/{project}/regions/{region}/subnetworks/{subnet_id} It is used to create a Private Service Connect (PSC) interface for the Kafka Connect workers. It must be located in the same region as the Kafka Connect cluster. The CIDR range of the subnet must be within the IPv4 address ranges for private networks, as specified in RFC 1918. The primary subnet CIDR range must have a minimum size of /22 (1024 addresses).
        },
      ],
    },
    &quot;secretPaths&quot;: [ # Optional. Secrets to load into workers. Exact SecretVersions from Secret Manager must be provided -- aliases are not supported. Up to 32 secrets may be loaded into one cluster. Format: projects//secrets//versions/
      &quot;A String&quot;,
    ],
  },
  &quot;kafkaCluster&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Immutable. The name of the Kafka cluster this Kafka Connect cluster is attached to. Structured like: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/clusters/{cluster}
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Optional. Labels as key value pairs.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The name of the Kafka Connect cluster. Structured like: projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/connectClusters/{connect_cluster_id}
  &quot;satisfiesPzi&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Reserved for future use.
  &quot;satisfiesPzs&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Reserved for future use.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The current state of the Kafka Connect cluster.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time when the cluster was last updated.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID to avoid duplication of requests. If a request times out or fails, retrying with the same ID allows the server to recognize the previous attempt. For at least 60 minutes, the server ignores duplicate requests bearing the same ID. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID within 60 minutes of the last request, the server checks if an original operation with the same request ID was received. If so, the server ignores the second request. The request ID must be a valid UUID. A zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the cluster resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. The mask is required and a value of * will update all fields.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
