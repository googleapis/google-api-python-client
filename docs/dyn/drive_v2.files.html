This method supports an */upload* URI and accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics: - *Maximum file size:* 5,120 GB - *Accepted Media MIME types:*`*/*` Note: Specify a valid MIME type, rather than the literal `*/*` value. The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see [Upload file data](/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads). Apps creating shortcuts with `files.insert` must specify the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`. Apps should specify a file extension in the `title` property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `"title": "cat.jpg"` in the metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the read-only `fileExtension` property populated with the extension originally specified in the `title` property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with extension) based on the title. In cases where the extension is missing, Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the file's MIME type.</p>

  <pre> Gets a file&#x27;s metadata or content by ID. If you provide the URL parameter `alt=media`, then the response includes the file contents in the response body. Downloading content with `alt=media` only works if the file is stored in Drive. To download Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides use [`files.export`](/drive/api/reference/rest/v2/files/export) instead. For more information, see [Download &amp; export files](/drive/api/guides/manage-downloads).

Args:
  fileId: string, The ID for the file in question. (required)
  acknowledgeAbuse: boolean, Whether the user is acknowledging the risk of downloading known malware or other abusive files. This is only applicable when the `alt` parameter is set to `media` and the user is the owner of the file or an organizer of the shared drive in which the file resides.
  includeLabels: string, A comma-separated list of IDs of labels to include in the `labelInfo` part of the response.
  includePermissionsForView: string, Specifies which additional view&#x27;s permissions to include in the response. Only `published` is supported.

  <pre> Gets a file&#x27;s metadata or content by ID. If you provide the URL parameter `alt=media`, then the response includes the file contents in the response body. Downloading content with `alt=media` only works if the file is stored in Drive. To download Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides use [`files.export`](/drive/api/reference/rest/v2/files/export) instead. For more information, see [Download &amp; export files](/drive/api/guides/manage-downloads).

Args:
  fileId: string, The ID for the file in question. (required)
  acknowledgeAbuse: boolean, Whether the user is acknowledging the risk of downloading known malware or other abusive files. This is only applicable when the `alt` parameter is set to `media` and the user is the owner of the file or an organizer of the shared drive in which the file resides.
  includeLabels: string, A comma-separated list of IDs of labels to include in the `labelInfo` part of the response.
  includePermissionsForView: string, Specifies which additional view&#x27;s permissions to include in the response. Only `published` is supported.
  projection: string, Deprecated: This parameter has no function.
    Allowed values
      BASIC - Deprecated.
      FULL - Deprecated.
  revisionId: string, Specifies the Revision ID that should be downloaded. Ignored unless alt=media is specified.
  supportsAllDrives: boolean, Whether the requesting application supports both My Drives and shared drives.
  supportsTeamDrives: boolean, Deprecated: Use `supportsAllDrives` instead.
  updateViewedDate: boolean, Deprecated: Use `files.update` with `modifiedDateBehavior=noChange, updateViewedDate=true` and an empty request body.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  The media object as a string.

  <pre> Inserts a new file. This method supports an */upload* URI and accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics: - *Maximum file size:* 5,120 GB - *Accepted Media MIME types:*`*/*` Note: Specify a valid MIME type, rather than the literal `*/*` value. The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see [Upload file data](/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads). Apps creating shortcuts with `files.insert` must specify the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`. Apps should specify a file extension in the `title` property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `&quot;title&quot;: &quot;cat.jpg&quot;` in the metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the read-only `fileExtension` property populated with the extension originally specified in the `title` property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with extension) based on the title. In cases where the extension is missing, Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the file&#x27;s MIME type.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  <pre> Lists the user&#x27;s files. This method accepts the `q` parameter, which is a search query combining one or more search terms. For more information, see the [Search for files &amp; folders](/drive/api/guides/search-files) guide. *Note:* This method returns *all* files by default, including trashed files. If you don&#x27;t want trashed files to appear in the list, use the `trashed=false` query parameter to remove trashed files from the results.

Args:
  corpora: string, Bodies of items (files/documents) to which the query applies. Supported bodies are `default`, `domain`, `drive` and `allDrives`. Prefer `default` or `drive` to `allDrives` for efficiency.
  corpus: string, Deprecated: The body of items (files/documents) to which the query applies. Use `corpora` instead.
    Allowed values
      DEFAULT - The items that the user has accessed.
      DOMAIN - Items shared to the user&#x27;s domain.
  driveId: string, ID of the shared drive to search.

  includeLabels: string, A comma-separated list of IDs of labels to include in the `labelInfo` part of the response.
  includePermissionsForView: string, Specifies which additional view&#x27;s permissions to include in the response. Only `published` is supported.
  includeTeamDriveItems: boolean, Deprecated: Use `includeItemsFromAllDrives` instead.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of files to return per page. Partial or empty result pages are possible even before the end of the files list has been reached.
  orderBy: string, A comma-separated list of sort keys. Valid keys are `createdDate`, `folder`, `lastViewedByMeDate`, `modifiedByMeDate`, `modifiedDate`, `quotaBytesUsed`, `recency`, `sharedWithMeDate`, `starred`, `title`, and `title_natural`. Each key sorts ascending by default, but may be reversed with the `desc` modifier. Example usage: ?orderBy=folder,modifiedDate desc,title. Please note that there is a current limitation for users with approximately one million files in which the requested sort order is ignored.
  pageToken: string, Page token for files.
  projection: string, Deprecated: This parameter has no function.
    Allowed values
      BASIC - Deprecated.
      FULL - Deprecated.

  <pre> Updates a file&#x27;s metadata and/or content. When calling this method, only populate fields in the request that you want to modify. When updating fields, some fields might be changed automatically, such as `modifiedDate`. This method supports patch semantics. This method supports an */upload* URI and accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics: - *Maximum file size:* 5,120 GB - *Accepted Media MIME types:*`*/*` Note: Specify a valid MIME type, rather than the literal `*/*` value. The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see [Upload file data](/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads).
