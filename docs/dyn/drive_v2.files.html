Supported groupings are: &#x27;user&#x27; (files created by, opened by, or shared directly with the user), &#x27;drive&#x27; (files in the specified shared drive as indicated by the &#x27;driveId&#x27;), &#x27;domain&#x27; (files shared to the user&#x27;s domain), and &#x27;allDrives&#x27; (A combination of &#x27;user&#x27; and &#x27;drive&#x27; for all drives where the user is a member). When able, use &#x27;user&#x27; or &#x27;drive&#x27;, instead of &#x27;allDrives&#x27;, for efficiency.
  corpus: string, The body of items (files/documents) to which the query applies. Deprecated: use &#x27;corpora&#x27; instead.

Each key sorts ascending by default, but may be reversed with the &#x27;desc&#x27; modifier. Example usage: ?orderBy=folder,modifiedDate desc,title. Please note that there is a current limitation for users with approximately one million files in which the requested sort order is ignored.
  pageToken: string, Page token for files.
  projection: string, This parameter is deprecated and has no function.
    Allowed values
