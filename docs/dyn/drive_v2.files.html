  <pre>Lists the user's files.

Args:
  orderBy: string, A comma-separated list of sort keys. Valid keys are 'createdDate', 'folder', 'lastViewedByMeDate', 'modifiedByMeDate', 'modifiedDate', 'quotaBytesUsed', 'recency', 'sharedWithMeDate', 'starred', and 'title'. Each key sorts ascending by default, but may be reversed with the 'desc' modifier. Example usage: ?orderBy=folder,modifiedDate desc,title. Please note that there is a current limitation for users with approximately one million files in which the requested sort order is ignored.
  projection: string, This parameter is deprecated and has no function.
    Allowed values
      BASIC - Deprecated
      FULL - Deprecated
  supportsTeamDrives: boolean, Whether the requesting application supports Team Drives.
  spaces: string, A comma-separated list of spaces to query. Supported values are 'drive', 'appDataFolder' and 'photos'.
  pageToken: string, Page token for files.
  corpus: string, The body of items (files/documents) to which the query applies. Deprecated: use 'corpora' instead.
    Allowed values
      DEFAULT - The items that the user has accessed.
      DOMAIN - Items shared to the user's domain.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of files to return per page. Partial or empty result pages are possible even before the end of the files list has been reached.
  teamDriveId: string, ID of Team Drive to search.
  includeTeamDriveItems: boolean, Whether Team Drive items should be included in results.
  corpora: string, Comma-separated list of bodies of items (files/documents) to which the query applies. Supported bodies are 'default', 'domain', 'teamDrive' and 'allTeamDrives'. 'allTeamDrives' must be combined with 'default'; all other values must be used in isolation. Prefer 'default' or 'teamDrive' to 'allTeamDrives' for efficiency.
  q: string, Query string for searching files.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A list of files.
