  <pre>Maps a domain to an application. A user must be authorized to administer a domain in order to map it to an application. For a list of available authorized domains, see AuthorizedDomains.ListAuthorizedDomains.

Args:
  appsId: string, Part of `parent`. Name of the parent Application resource. Example: apps/myapp. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A domain serving an App Engine application.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Relative name of the domain serving the application. Example: example.com.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Full path to the DomainMapping resource in the API. Example: apps/myapp/domainMapping/example.com.@OutputOnly
  &quot;resourceRecords&quot;: [ # The resource records required to configure this domain mapping. These records must be added to the domain&#x27;s DNS configuration in order to serve the application via this domain mapping.@OutputOnly
    { # A DNS resource record.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Relative name of the object affected by this record. Only applicable for CNAME records. Example: &#x27;www&#x27;.
      &quot;rrdata&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Data for this record. Values vary by record type, as defined in RFC 1035 (section 5) and RFC 1034 (section 3.6.1).
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Resource record type. Example: AAAA.
    },
  ],
  &quot;sslSettings&quot;: { # SSL configuration for a DomainMapping resource. # SSL configuration for this domain. If unconfigured, this domain will not serve with SSL.
    &quot;certificateId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # ID of the AuthorizedCertificate resource configuring SSL for the application. Clearing this field will remove SSL support.By default, a managed certificate is automatically created for every domain mapping. To omit SSL support or to configure SSL manually, specify SslManagementType.MANUAL on a CREATE or UPDATE request. You must be authorized to administer the AuthorizedCertificate resource to manually map it to a DomainMapping resource. Example: 12345.
    &quot;pendingManagedCertificateId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # ID of the managed AuthorizedCertificate resource currently being provisioned, if applicable. Until the new managed certificate has been successfully provisioned, the previous SSL state will be preserved. Once the provisioning process completes, the certificate_id field will reflect the new managed certificate and this field will be left empty. To remove SSL support while there is still a pending managed certificate, clear the certificate_id field with an UpdateDomainMappingRequest.@OutputOnly
    &quot;sslManagementType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # SSL management type for this domain. If AUTOMATIC, a managed certificate is automatically provisioned. If MANUAL, certificate_id must be manually specified in order to configure SSL for this domain.
  },
}

  overrideStrategy: string, Whether the domain creation should override any existing mappings for this domain. By default, overrides are rejected.
    Allowed values
      UNSPECIFIED_DOMAIN_OVERRIDE_STRATEGY - Strategy unspecified. Defaults to STRICT.
      STRICT - Overrides not allowed. If a mapping already exists for the specified domain, the request will return an ALREADY_EXISTS (409).
      OVERRIDE - Overrides allowed. If a mapping already exists for the specified domain, the request will overwrite it. Note that this might stop another Google product from serving. For example, if the domain is mapped to another App Engine application, that app will no longer serve from that domain.
