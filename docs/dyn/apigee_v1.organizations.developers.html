**Warning**: This API will permanently delete the developer
and related artifacts.

To avoid permanently deleting developers and their artifacts,
set the developer status to `inactive` using
the SetDeveloperStatus API.

**Note**: The delete operation is asynchronous. The developer app is
deleted immediately,
but its associated resources, such as apps and API keys, may take anywhere
from a few seconds to a few minutes to be deleted.

query parameters.

request:
  `organizations/{org}`. (required)
  includeCompany: boolean, Flag that specifies whether to include company details in the response.

the `count` or `startKey` query parameters.
  startKey: string, **Note**: Must be used in conjunction with the `count` parameter.

Email address of the developer from which to start displaying the list of
developers. For example, if the an unfiltered list returns:

```
westley@example.com
fezzik@example.com

and your `startKey` is `fezzik@example.com`, the list returned will be

```
fezzik@example.com

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setDeveloperStatus">setDeveloperStatus(name, action=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the status of a developer. Valid values are `active` or `inactive`.

A developer is `active` by default. If you set a developer&#x27;s status to
`inactive`, the API keys assigned to the developer apps are no longer valid
even though the API keys are set to `approved`. Inactive developers
can still sign in to the developer portal and create apps; however, any
new API keys generated during app creation won&#x27;t work.

If successful, the API call returns the
following HTTP status code: `204 No Content`

Args:
  name: string, Required. Email address of the developer. Use the following structure in your
request:
  `organizations/{org}/developers/{developer_email}` (required)
  action: string, Status of the developer. Valid values are `active` and `inactive`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }
      #
      # The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="update">update(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates a developer.

This API replaces the existing developer details with those specified
in the request. Include or exclude any existing details that
you want to retain or delete, respectively.

The custom attribute limit is 18.

**Note**: OAuth access tokens and Key Management Service (KMS) entities
(apps, developers, and API products) are cached for 180 seconds
(current default). Any custom attributes associated with these entities
are cached for at least 180 seconds after the entity is accessed at
runtime. Therefore, an `ExpiresIn` element on the OAuthV2 policy
won&#x27;t be able to expire an access token in less than 180 seconds.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Email address of the developer. Use the following structure in your
request:
  `organizations/{org}/developers/{developer_email}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;userName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. User name of the developer. Not used by Apigee hybrid.
