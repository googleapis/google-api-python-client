<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(appsId, operationsId, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

Args:
  appsId: string, Part of `name`. The name of the operation resource. (required)
  operationsId: string, Part of `name`. See documentation of `appsId`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "error": { # The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC (https://github.com/grpc). Each Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the API Design Guide (https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
