  <code><a href="#batchUpdate">batchUpdate(documentId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Applies one or more updates to the document. Each request is validated before being applied. If any request is not valid, then the entire request will fail and nothing will be applied. Some requests have replies to give you some information about how they are applied. Other requests do not need to return information; these each return an empty reply. The order of replies matches that of the requests. For example, suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the third one returns information. The response would have two empty replies, the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order. Because other users may be editing the document, the document might not exactly reflect your changes: your changes may be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no collaborators, the document should reflect your changes. In any case, the updates in your request are guaranteed to be applied together atomically.</p>

When using `target_revision_id`, the API client can be thought of as another collaborator of the document. The target revision ID may only be used to write to recent versions of a document. If the target revision is too far behind the latest revision, the request will not be processed and will return a 400 bad request error and the request should be retried after reading the latest version of the document. In most cases a `revision_id` will remain valid for use as a target revision for several minutes after it is read, but for frequently-edited documents this window may be shorter.

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

            &quot;textStyle&quot;: { # Represents the styling that can be applied to text. Inherited text styles are represented as unset fields in this message. A text style&#x27;s parent depends on where the text style is defined: * The TextStyle of text in a Paragraph inherits from the paragraph&#x27;s corresponding named style type. * The TextStyle on a named style inherits from the normal text named style. * The TextStyle of the normal text named style inherits from the default text style in the Docs editor. * The TextStyle on a Paragraph element that is contained in a table may inherit its text style from the table style.

                },
              },
              &quot;baselineOffset&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The text&#x27;s vertical offset from its normal position. Text with `SUPERSCRIPT` or `SUBSCRIPT` baseline offsets is automatically rendered in a smaller font size, computed based on the `font_size` field. The `font_size` itself is not affected by changes in this field.

Links are not inherited from parent text. Changing the link in an update request causes some other changes to the text style of the range: * When setting a link, the text foreground color will be updated to the default link color and the text will be underlined. If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters. As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholder are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.
            &quot;glyphSymbol&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A custom glyph symbol used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are unordered. The glyph symbol replaces placeholders within the glyph_format. For example, if the glyph_symbol is the solid circle corresponding to Unicode U+25cf code point and the glyph_format is `%0`, the rendered glyph would be the solid circle.
            &quot;glyphType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request.

Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.

This range corresponds to the numerical values described in the CSS 2.1 Specification, [section 15.6](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#font-boldness), with non-numerical values disallowed. The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. The rendered weight is determined by a combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. The rendered weight is determined by a combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholder are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph symbol replaces placeholders within the glyph_format.

            &quot;glyphType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholder are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

The rendered weight is determined by a combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. The rendered weight is determined by a combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholder are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph symbol replaces placeholders within the glyph_format.

            &quot;glyphType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholder are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

The rendered weight is determined by a combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.
