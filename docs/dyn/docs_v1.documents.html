  <code><a href="#batchUpdate">batchUpdate(documentId, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Applies one or more updates to the document. Each request is validated before being applied. If any request is not valid, then the entire request will fail and nothing will be applied. Some requests have replies to give you some information about how they are applied. Other requests do not need to return information; these each return an empty reply. The order of replies matches that of the requests. For example, suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the third one returns information. The response would have two empty replies, the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order. Because other users may be editing the document, the document might not exactly reflect your changes: your changes may be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no collaborators, the document should reflect your changes. In any case, the updates in your request are guaranteed to be applied together atomically.</p>

When using target revision ID, the API client can be thought of as another collaborator of the document. The target revision ID can only be used to write to recent versions of a document. If the target revision is too far behind the latest revision, the request is not processed and returns a 400 bad request error. The request should be tried again after retrieving the latest version of the document. Usually a revision ID remains valid for use as a target revision for several minutes after it&#x27;s read, but for frequently edited documents this window might be shorter.

    &quot;targetRevisionId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The optional target revision ID of the document the write request is applied to. If collaborator changes have occurred after the document was read using the API, the changes produced by this write request are applied against the collaborator changes. This results in a new revision of the document that incorporates both the collaborator changes and the changes in the request, with the Docs server resolving conflicting changes. When using target revision ID, the API client can be thought of as another collaborator of the document. The target revision ID can only be used to write to recent versions of a document. If the target revision is too far behind the latest revision, the request is not processed and returns a 400 bad request error. The request should be tried again after retrieving the latest version of the document. Usually a revision ID remains valid for use as a target revision for several minutes after it&#x27;s read, but for frequently edited documents this window might be shorter.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholders are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph symbol replaces placeholders within the glyph_format. For example, if the glyph_symbol is the solid circle corresponding to Unicode U+25cf code point and the glyph_format is `%0`, the rendered glyph would be the solid circle.
            &quot;glyphType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholders are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph symbol replaces placeholders within the glyph_format. For example, if the glyph_symbol is the solid circle corresponding to Unicode U+25cf code point and the glyph_format is `%0`, the rendered glyph would be the solid circle.
                &quot;glyphType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholders are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.

            &quot;glyphType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholders are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.

The glyph symbol replaces placeholders within the glyph_format. For example, if the glyph_symbol is the solid circle corresponding to Unicode U+25cf code point and the glyph_format is `%0`, the rendered glyph would be the solid circle.
                &quot;glyphType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

Can be used in update requests to specify which revision of a document to apply updates to and how the request should behave if the document has been edited since that revision.

A returned revision ID is only guaranteed to be valid for 24 hours after it has been returned and cannot be shared across users. If the revision ID is unchanged between calls, then the document has not changed. Conversely, a changed ID (for the same document and user) usually means the document has been updated.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="get">get(documentId, suggestionsViewMode=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the latest version of the specified document.

Args:
  documentId: string, The ID of the document to retrieve. (required)
  suggestionsViewMode: string, The suggestions view mode to apply to the document. This allows viewing the document with all suggestions inline, accepted or rejected. If one is not specified, DEFAULT_FOR_CURRENT_ACCESS is used.
    Allowed values
      DEFAULT_FOR_CURRENT_ACCESS - The SuggestionsViewMode applied to the returned document depends on the user&#x27;s current access level. If the user only has view access, PREVIEW_WITHOUT_SUGGESTIONS is applied. Otherwise, SUGGESTIONS_INLINE is applied. This is the default suggestions view mode.
      SUGGESTIONS_INLINE - The returned document has suggestions inline. Suggested changes will be differentiated from base content within the document. Requests to retrieve a document using this mode will return a 403 error if the user does not have permission to view suggested changes.
      PREVIEW_SUGGESTIONS_ACCEPTED - The returned document is a preview with all suggested changes accepted. Requests to retrieve a document using this mode will return a 403 error if the user does not have permission to view suggested changes.
      PREVIEW_WITHOUT_SUGGESTIONS - The returned document is a preview with all suggested changes rejected if there are any suggestions in the document.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.

The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholders are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.

            &quot;glyphType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `&quot;ABC\n123&quot;`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request.

                &quot;glyphFormat&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The format string used by bullets at this level of nesting. The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholders are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph&#x27;s order within the list.
                &quot;glyphSymbol&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A custom glyph symbol used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are unordered. The glyph symbol replaces placeholders within the glyph_format. For example, if the glyph_symbol is the solid circle corresponding to Unicode U+25cf code point and the glyph_format is `%0`, the rendered glyph would be the solid circle.
                &quot;glyphType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item&#x27;s order within the list.

However, a changed ID can also be due to internal factors such as ID format changes.

The default value is `400` (&quot;normal&quot;). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style&#x27;s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.
