  <pre>Marks the Recommendation State as Failed. Users can use this method to indicate to the Recommender API that they have applied the recommendation themselves, and the operation failed. This stops the recommendation content from being updated. Associated insights are frozen and placed in the ACCEPTED state. MarkRecommendationFailed can be applied to recommendations in ACTIVE, CLAIMED, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED state. Requires the recommender.*.update IAM permission for the specified recommender.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the recommendation. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `MarkRecommendationFailed` Method.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Fingerprint of the Recommendation. Provides optimistic locking.
  &quot;stateMetadata&quot;: { # State properties to include with this state. Overwrites any existing `state_metadata`. Keys must match the regex `/^a-z0-9{0,62}$/`. Values must match the regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_./-]{0,255}$/`.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="markSucceeded">markSucceeded(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Marks the Recommendation State as Succeeded. Users can use this method to indicate to the Recommender API that they have applied the recommendation themselves, and the operation was successful. This stops the recommendation content from being updated. Associated insights are frozen and placed in the ACCEPTED state. MarkRecommendationSucceeded can be applied to recommendations in ACTIVE, CLAIMED, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED state. Requires the recommender.*.update IAM permission for the specified recommender.

Args:
  name: string, Required. Name of the recommendation. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for the `MarkRecommendationSucceeded` Method.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Fingerprint of the Recommendation. Provides optimistic locking.
  &quot;stateMetadata&quot;: { # State properties to include with this state. Overwrites any existing `state_metadata`. Keys must match the regex `/^a-z0-9{0,62}$/`. Values must match the regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_./-]{0,255}$/`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A recommendation along with a suggested action. E.g., a rightsizing recommendation for an underutilized VM, IAM role recommendations, etc
