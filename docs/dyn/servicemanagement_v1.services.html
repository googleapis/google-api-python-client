<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new managed service.

A managed service is immutable, and is subject to mandatory 30-day
data retention. You cannot move a service or recreate it within 30 days
after deletion.

One producer project can own no more than 500 services. For security and
reliability purposes, a production service should be hosted in a
dedicated producer project.

Operation&lt;response: ManagedService&gt;

Args:
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The full representation of a Service that is managed by
    # Google Service Management.
  "serviceName": "A String", # The name of the service. See the [overview](/service-management/overview)
      # for naming requirements.
  "producerProjectId": "A String", # ID of the project that produces and owns this service.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

            # This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456`  | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")`
            #
            # Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
            # automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
            # For example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {

            #       }
            #     }
            #     message GetMessageRequest {
            #       message SubMessage {
            #         string subfield = 1;
            #       }
            #       string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.
            #       int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.
            #       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.
            #     }
            #
            # This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&amp;sub.subfield=foo` |
            # `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield:
            # "foo"))`
            #
            # Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
            # primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
            # In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
            # as `...?param=A&amp;param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
            # message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
            # `...?foo.a=A&amp;foo.b=B&amp;foo.c=C`.
            #
            # For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field
            # specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
            # message resource collection:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           body: "message"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message UpdateMessageRequest {
            #       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
            #       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
            #     }
            #
            # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
            # representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
            # protos JSON encoding:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
            # "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`
            #
            # The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
            # every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
            # request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
            # the update method:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           body: "*"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message Message {
            #       string message_id = 1;
            #       string text = 2;
            #     }
            #
            #
            # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
            # "123456" text: "Hi!")`
            #
            # Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
            # have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
            # the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
            # defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
            # which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
            #
            # It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
            # the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           additional_bindings {
            #             get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
            #           }
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message GetMessageRequest {
            #       string message_id = 1;
            #       string user_id = 2;
            #     }
            #
            # This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
            # `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:
            # "123456")`
            #
            # ## Rules for HTTP mapping
            #
            # 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
            #    message) are classified into three categories:
            #    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
            #    - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP
            #      request body.
            #    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
            #      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated
            #      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same
            #      name.
            #  2. If HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all fields
            #     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
            #  3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all
            #     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.
            #
            # ### Path template syntax
            #
            #     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
            #     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
            #     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
            #     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
            #     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
            #     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
            #
            # The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches
            # zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
            # except the `Verb`.
            #
            # The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
            # template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
            # matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
            # is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
            #
            # The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
            # contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
            # before the matching.
            #
            # If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
            # `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
            # side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The
            # server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
            # [Discovery
            # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
            # `{var}`.
            #
            # If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/*}"`
            # or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
            # client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.
            # The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
            # unchanged. Such variables show up in the
            # [Discovery
            # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
            # `{+var}`.
            #
            # ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration
            #
            # gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
            # for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
            # service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
            # proto message.
            #
            # As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
            # transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
            # `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
            # effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
            # have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
            # specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
            # configuration in the proto.
            #
            # Example:
            #
            #     http:
            #       rules:
            #         # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.
            #         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
            #           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
            #
            # ## Special notes
            #
            # When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
            # proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
            # specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
            #
            # While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
            # [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
            # Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
            # 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
            # does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
            # to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
            # for multi segment variables.
            #
            # The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
            # because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.
            #
            # The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason
            # is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
            # character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
            #
            # Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
            # no client library can support such complicated mapping.
            #
            # If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map

        "unit": "A String", # The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable
            # if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or `DISTRIBUTION`. The `unit`
            # defines the representation of the stored metric values.
            #
            # Different systems may scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a
            # value of `0.02KBy` _might_ be displayed as `20By`, and a value of
            # `3523KBy` _might_ be displayed as `3.5MBy`). However, if the `unit` is
            # `KBy`, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no
            # matter how it may be displayed..
            #
            # If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used
            # by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is
            # `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the job uses 12,005
            # CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`.
            #
            # Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more
            # granular way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is
            # `ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005` (which is `12005/1000`),
            # or use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`).

            #
            # **Grammar**
            #
            # The grammar also includes these connectors:
            #
            # * `/`    division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples,
            #          `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost never
            #          have `/s` in a metric `unit`; rates should always be computed at
            #          query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value).
            # * `.`    multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For
            #          examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`.
            #
            # The grammar for a unit is as follows:
            #
            #     Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ;
            #
            #     Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ]
            #               | Annotation
            #               | "1"
            #               ;
            #
            #     Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ;
            #
            # Notes:
            #
            # * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`. If the annotation
            #    is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to `1`. For examples,
            #    `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`.
            # * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not
            #    containing `{` or `}`.
            # * `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless
            #    unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such
            #    as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units are
            #    appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented as
            #    `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5 new
            #    users). Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would be
            #    represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric
            #    value of `5.3` would mean "5300 page views per day").
            # * `%` represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving
            #    a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100,
            #    and a metric value `3` means "3 percent").
            # * `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range
            #    0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage
            #    (so a metric value `0.03` means "3 percent").

    <code class="details" id="list">list(producerProjectId=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, consumerId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists managed services.

Returns all public services. For authenticated users, also returns all
services the calling user has "servicemanagement.services.get" permission
for.

**BETA:** If the caller specifies the `consumer_id`, it returns only the
services enabled on the consumer. The `consumer_id` must have the format
of "project:{PROJECT-ID}".

Args:
  producerProjectId: string, Include services produced by the specified project.
  pageSize: integer, The max number of items to include in the response list. Page size is 50
if not specified. Maximum value is 100.
  pageToken: string, Token identifying which result to start with; returned by a previous list
call.
  consumerId: string, Include services consumed by the specified consumer.

The Google Service Management implementation accepts the following
forms:
- project:&lt;project_id&gt;
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `ListServices` method.
    "services": [ # The returned services will only have the name field set.
      { # The full representation of a Service that is managed by
          # Google Service Management.

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="setIamPolicy">setIamPolicy(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces any
existing policy.

Can return Public Errors: NOT_FOUND, INVALID_ARGUMENT and PERMISSION_DENIED

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
      # Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
      # permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
      # custom role.

      # Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
      # expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
      # to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.

Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware
UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation
may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested.
See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with
        # wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more
        # information see
        # [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is
        # allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
  }</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="undelete">undelete(serviceName, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Revives a previously deleted managed service. The method restores the
service using the configuration at the time the service was deleted.
The target service must exist and must have been deleted within the
last 30 days.

Operation&lt;response: UndeleteServiceResponse&gt;

Args:
  serviceName: string, Required. The name of the service. See the [overview](/service-management/overview)
for naming requirements. For example: `example.googleapis.com`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
