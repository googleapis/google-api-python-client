        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There will be a
          # common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {

        # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
        # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

            #

            # protos JSON encoding:
            #
            # HTTP | RPC
            # -----|-----
            # `PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`
            #
            # The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
            # every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
            # request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
            # the update method:
            #
            # ```proto
            # service Messaging {
            #   rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
            #     option (google.api.http) = {
            #       put: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #       body: "*"
            #     };
            #   }
            # }
            # message Message {
            #   string message_id = 1;
            #   string text = 2;
            # }
            # ```
            #
            # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
            #
            # HTTP | RPC
            # -----|-----
            # `PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")`
            #
            # Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
            # have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
            # the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice of
            # defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
            # which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
            #
            # It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
            # the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
            #
            # ```proto
            # service Messaging {
            #   rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #     option (google.api.http) = {
            #       get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #       additional_bindings {
            #         get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
            #       }
            #     };
            #   }
            # }
            # message GetMessageRequest {
            #   string message_id = 1;
            #   string user_id = 2;
            # }
            # ```
            #
            # This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC
            # mappings:
            #
            # HTTP | RPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
            # `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id: "123456")`
            #
            # # Rules for HTTP mapping
            #
            # The rules for mapping HTTP path, query parameters, and body fields
            # to the request message are as follows:
            #
            # 1. The `body` field specifies either `*` or a field path, or is
            #    omitted. If omitted, it assumes there is no HTTP body.
            # 2. Leaf fields (recursive expansion of nested messages in the
            #    request) can be classified into three types:
            #     (a) Matched in the URL template.
            #     (b) Covered by body (if body is `*`, everything except (a) fields;
            #         else everything under the body field)
            #     (c) All other fields.
            # 3. URL query parameters found in the HTTP request are mapped to (c) fields.
            # 4. Any body sent with an HTTP request can contain only (b) fields.
            #
            # The syntax of the path template is as follows:
            #
            #     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
            #     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
            #     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
            #     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
            #     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
            #     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
            #
            # The syntax `*` matches a single path segment. It follows the semantics of
            # [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
            # Expansion.
            #
            # The syntax `**` matches zero or more path segments. It follows the semantics
            # of [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.3 Reserved
            # Expansion.
            #
            # The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path.
            #
            # The syntax `Variable` matches the entire path as specified by its template;
            # this nested template must not contain further variables. If a variable
            # matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
            # is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
            #
            # NOTE: the field paths in variables and in the `body` must not refer to
            # repeated fields or map fields.
            #
            # Use CustomHttpPattern to specify any HTTP method that is not included in the
            # `pattern` field, such as HEAD, or "*" to leave the HTTP method unspecified for

            #
            #     Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ;

`resource` is usually specified as a path. For example, a Project
resource is specified as `projects/{project}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `GetIamPolicy` method.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:

        # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
        # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There will be a
          # common set of message types for APIs to use.
        {
          "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
