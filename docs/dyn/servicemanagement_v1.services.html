            # gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or
            # more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service
            # that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google
            # APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis),
            # [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
            # Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway),
            # and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
            # and use it for large scale production services.
            #
            # `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies
            # how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL
            # path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the
            # gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
            # typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.
            #
            # Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path
            # template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long
            # as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type.
            # The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to
            # the URL path.
            #
            # Example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {

            #     }
            #     message Message {
            #       string text = 1; // The resource content.
            #     }
            #

            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456`  | `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")`
            #
            # Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template
            # automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body.
            # For example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {

            #       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.

            # "foo"))`
            #
            # Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a
            # primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type.
            # In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL
            # as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the
            # message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as
            # `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`.
            #
            # For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field
            # specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
            # message resource collection:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           body: "message"
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message UpdateMessageRequest {
            #       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
            #       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
            #     }
            #
            # The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
            # representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
            # protos JSON encoding:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC

            #
            # The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that

            # `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id:
            # "123456" text: "Hi!")`
            #
            # Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
            # have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
            # the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when
            # defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
            # which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
            #
            # It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
            # the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
            #
            #     service Messaging {
            #       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
            #         option (google.api.http) = {
            #           get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            #           additional_bindings {
            #             get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
            #           }
            #         };
            #       }
            #     }
            #     message GetMessageRequest {
            #       string message_id = 1;
            #       string user_id = 2;
            #     }
            #
            # This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:
            #
            # HTTP | gRPC
            # -----|-----
            # `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
            # `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id:
            # "123456")`
            #
            # ## Rules for HTTP mapping
            #
            # 1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request
            #    message) are classified into three categories:
            #    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.
            #    - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP
            #      request body.
            #    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the
            #      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated

            #     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.
            #  3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all

            #
            # ### Path template syntax
            #
            #     Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
            #     Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
            #     Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
            #     Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
            #     FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
            #     Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
            #
            # The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches
            # zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
            # except the `Verb`.
            #
            # The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
            # template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
            # matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
            # is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
            #
            # The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
            # contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded
            # before the matching.
            #
            # If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
            # `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client
            # side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The
            # server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the
            # [Discovery
            # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
            # `{var}`.
            #
            # If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `"{var=foo/*}"`
            # or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the
            # client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded.
            # The server side does the reverse decoding, except "%2F" and "%2f" are left
            # unchanged. Such variables show up in the
            # [Discovery
            # Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as

            # ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration
            #
            # gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language
            # for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The
            # service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
            # proto message.
            #
            # As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC
            # transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a
            # `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same
            # effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you
            # have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding
            # specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding
            # configuration in the proto.
            #
            # Example:
            #
            #     http:
            #       rules:
            #         # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.
            #         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage
            #           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
            #
            # ## Special notes
            #
            # When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the
            # proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
            # specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
            #
            # While the single segment variable follows the semantics of
            # [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
            # Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section
            # 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
            # does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
            # to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding
            # for multi segment variables.
            #
            # The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field,
            # because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.
            #
            # The path variables **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason
            # is that the most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/"
            # character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
            #
            # Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because
            # no client library can support such complicated mapping.
            #
            # If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map

        # The metric based quota configuration works this way:
        # - The service configuration defines a set of metrics.
        # - For API calls, the quota.metric_rules maps methods to metrics with
        #   corresponding costs.
        # - The quota.limits defines limits on the metrics, which will be used for
        #   quota checks at runtime.

service using the configuration at the time the service was deleted.
The target service must exist and must have been deleted within the
last 30 days.

Operation<response: UndeleteServiceResponse>

Args:
  serviceName: string, The name of the service. See the [overview](/service-management/overview)
for naming requirements. For example: `example.googleapis.com`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
    "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
        # three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
        #
        # You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
        # [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
          # message types for APIs to use.
        {
          "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
