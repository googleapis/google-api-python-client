  <pre>Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage location. The output format is newline-delimited JSON. This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API allowing you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation result. For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually finishes within 5 minutes.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an organization number (such as &quot;organizations/123&quot;), a project ID (such as &quot;projects/my-project-id&quot;), a project number (such as &quot;projects/12345&quot;), or a folder number (such as &quot;folders/123&quot;). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Export asset request.
  &quot;assetTypes&quot;: [ # A list of asset types of which to take a snapshot for. For example: &quot;google.compute.Disk&quot;. If specified, only matching assets will be returned. See [Introduction to Cloud Asset Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview) for all supported asset types.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
  &quot;contentType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name will be returned.
  &quot;outputConfig&quot;: { # Output configuration for export assets destination. # Required. Output configuration indicating where the results will be output to. All results will be in newline delimited JSON format.
    &quot;gcsDestination&quot;: { # A Cloud Storage location. # Destination on Cloud Storage.
      &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URI of the Cloud Storage object. It&#x27;s the same URI that is used by gsutil. For example: &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name&quot;. See [Viewing and Editing Object Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/viewing-editing-metadata) for more information.
      &quot;uriPrefix&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The URI prefix of all generated Cloud Storage objects. For example: &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix&quot;. Each object URI is in format: &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix// and only contains assets for that type. starts from 0. For example: &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/google.compute.disk/0&quot; is the first shard of output objects containing all google.compute.disk assets. An INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned if file with the same name &quot;gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix&quot; already exists.
    },
  },
  &quot;readTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Timestamp to take an asset snapshot. This can only be set to a timestamp between 2018-10-02 UTC (inclusive) and the current time. If not specified, the current time will be used. Due to delays in resource data collection and indexing, there is a volatile window during which running the same query may get different results.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
      {
        &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
      },
    ],
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
