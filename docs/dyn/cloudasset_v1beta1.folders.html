  <pre>Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage
location. The output format is newline-delimited JSON.
This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API allowing you
to keep track of the export.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an
organization number (such as "organizations/123"), a project ID (such as
"projects/my-project-id"), a project number (such as "projects/12345"), or
a folder number (such as "folders/123"). (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Export asset request.
    "assetTypes": [ # A list of asset types of which to take a snapshot for. For example:
        # "google.compute.Disk". If specified, only matching assets will be returned.
        # See [Introduction to Cloud Asset
        # Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview)
        # for all supported asset types.
      "A String",
    ],
    "contentType": "A String", # Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name will be
        # returned.
    "outputConfig": { # Output configuration for export assets destination. # Required. Output configuration indicating where the results will be output
        # to. All results will be in newline delimited JSON format.
      "gcsDestination": { # A Cloud Storage location. # Destination on Cloud Storage.
        "uriPrefix": "A String", # The uri prefix of all generated Cloud Storage objects. For example:
            # "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix". Each object uri is in format:
            # "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/&lt;asset type&gt;/&lt;shard number&gt; and only
            # contains assets for that type. &lt;shard number&gt; starts from 0. For example:
            # "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/google.compute.disk/0" is the first
            # shard of output objects containing all google.compute.disk assets.
            # An INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned if file with the same name
            # "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix" already exists.
        "uri": "A String", # The uri of the Cloud Storage object. It's the same uri that is used by
            # gsutil. For example: "gs://bucket_name/object_name". See [Viewing and
            # Editing Object
            # Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/viewing-editing-metadata)
            # for more information.
      },
    },
    "readTime": "A String", # Timestamp to take an asset snapshot. This can only be set to a timestamp
        # between 2018-10-02 UTC (inclusive) and the current time. If not specified,
        # the current time will be used. Due to delays in resource data collection
        # and indexing, there is a volatile window during which running the same
        # query may get different results.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
        # three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
        #
        # You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
        # [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
          # message types for APIs to use.
        {
          "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
