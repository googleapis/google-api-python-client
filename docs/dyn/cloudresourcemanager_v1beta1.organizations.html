    <code class="details" id="getIamPolicy">getIamPolicy(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Gets the access control policy for an Organization resource. May be empty if no such policy or resource exists.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. `resource` is usually specified as a path, such as `projects/*project*/zones/*zone*/disks/*disk*`.

A `Binding` binds a list of `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups, Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions defined by IAM. **Example** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/owner", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"] }, { "role": "roles/viewer", "members": ["user:sean@example.com"] } ] } For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM developer's guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam).

  filter: string, An optional query string used to filter the Organizations to return in the response. Filter rules are case-insensitive. Organizations may be filtered by `owner.directoryCustomerId` or by `domain`, where the domain is a Google for Work domain, for example: |Filter|Description| |------|-----------| |owner.directorycustomerid:123456789|Organizations with `owner.directory_customer_id` equal to `123456789`.| |domain:google.com|Organizations corresponding to the domain `google.com`.| This field is optional.
