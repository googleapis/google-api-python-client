    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="getScans">getScans(name, endTime=None, startTime=None, view=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Request a specific scan with Database-specific data for Cloud Key Visualizer.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The unique name of the scan containing the requested information, specific to the Database service implementing this interface. (required)
  endTime: string, The upper bound for the time range to retrieve Scan data for.
  startTime: string, These fields restrict the Database-specific information returned in the `Scan.data` field. If a `View` is provided that does not include the `Scan.data` field, these are ignored. This range of time must be entirely contained within the defined time range of the targeted scan. The lower bound for the time range to retrieve Scan data for.
  view: string, Specifies which parts of the Scan should be returned in the response. Note, if left unspecified, the FULL view is assumed.
    Allowed values
      VIEW_UNSPECIFIED - Not specified, equivalent to SUMMARY.
      SUMMARY - Server responses only include `name`, `details`, `start_time` and `end_time`. The default value. Note, the ListScans method may only use this view type, others view types are not supported.
      FULL - Full representation of the scan is returned in the server response, including `data`.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.

Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts). For example, `my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `admins@example.com`. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted.

  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that the caller has on the specified database or backup resource. Attempting this RPC on a non-existent Cloud Spanner database will result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has `spanner.databases.list` permission on the containing Cloud Spanner instance. Otherwise returns an empty set of permissions. Calling this method on a backup that does not exist will result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has `spanner.backups.list` permission on the containing instance.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The Cloud Spanner resource for which permissions are being tested. The format is `projects//instances/` for instance resources and `projects//instances//databases/` for database resources. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # REQUIRED: The set of permissions to check for &#x27;resource&#x27;. Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.instances.*&#x27;) are not allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # A subset of `TestPermissionsRequest.permissions` that the caller is allowed.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}</pre>
</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="updateDdl">updateDdl(database, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Updates the schema of a Cloud Spanner database by creating/altering/dropping tables, columns, indexes, etc. The returned long-running operation will have a name of the format `/operations/` and can be used to track execution of the schema change(s). The metadata field type is UpdateDatabaseDdlMetadata. The operation has no response.

Args:
  database: string, Required. The database to update. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Enqueues the given DDL statements to be applied, in order but not necessarily all at once, to the database schema at some point (or points) in the future. The server checks that the statements are executable (syntactically valid, name tables that exist, etc.) before enqueueing them, but they may still fail upon later execution (e.g., if a statement from another batch of statements is applied first and it conflicts in some way, or if there is some data-related problem like a `NULL` value in a column to which `NOT NULL` would be added). If a statement fails, all subsequent statements in the batch are automatically cancelled. Each batch of statements is assigned a name which can be used with the Operations API to monitor progress. See the operation_id field for more details.
  &quot;operationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If empty, the new update request is assigned an automatically-generated operation ID. Otherwise, `operation_id` is used to construct the name of the resulting Operation. Specifying an explicit operation ID simplifies determining whether the statements were executed in the event that the UpdateDatabaseDdl call is replayed, or the return value is otherwise lost: the database and `operation_id` fields can be combined to form the name of the resulting longrunning.Operation: `/operations/`. `operation_id` should be unique within the database, and must be a valid identifier: `a-z*`. Note that automatically-generated operation IDs always begin with an underscore. If the named operation already exists, UpdateDatabaseDdl returns `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
  &quot;protoDescriptors&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Proto descriptors used by CREATE/ALTER PROTO BUNDLE statements. Contains a protobuf-serialized [google.protobuf.FileDescriptorSet](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto). To generate it, [install](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) and run `protoc` with --include_imports and --descriptor_set_out. For example, to generate for moon/shot/app.proto, run &quot;&quot;&quot; $protoc --proto_path=/app_path --proto_path=/lib_path \ --include_imports \ --descriptor_set_out=descriptors.data \ moon/shot/app.proto &quot;&quot;&quot; For more details, see protobuffer [self description](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/techniques#self-description).
  &quot;statements&quot;: [ # Required. DDL statements to be applied to the database.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
