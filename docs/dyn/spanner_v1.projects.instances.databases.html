      # `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

      # custom role.

  <pre>Returns permissions that the caller has on the specified database or backup
resource.

Attempting this RPC on a non-existent Cloud Spanner database will
result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has
`spanner.databases.list` permission on the containing Cloud
Spanner instance. Otherwise returns an empty set of permissions.
Calling this method on a backup that does not exist will
result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has
`spanner.backups.list` permission on the containing instance.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The Cloud Spanner resource for which permissions are being tested. The format is `projects/&lt;project ID&gt;/instances/&lt;instance ID&gt;` for instance resources and `projects/&lt;project ID&gt;/instances/&lt;instance ID&gt;/databases/&lt;database ID&gt;` for database resources. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
    &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # REQUIRED: The set of permissions to check for &#x27;resource&#x27;.
        # Permissions with wildcards (such as &#x27;*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.*&#x27;, &#x27;spanner.instances.*&#x27;) are not allowed.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

    The object takes the form of:

{ # Enqueues the given DDL statements to be applied, in order but not
      # necessarily all at once, to the database schema at some point (or
      # points) in the future. The server checks that the statements
      # are executable (syntactically valid, name tables that exist, etc.)
      # before enqueueing them, but they may still fail upon
      # later execution (e.g., if a statement from another batch of
      # statements is applied first and it conflicts in some way, or if
      # there is some data-related problem like a `NULL` value in a column to
      # which `NOT NULL` would be added). If a statement fails, all
      # subsequent statements in the batch are automatically cancelled.
      # 
      # Each batch of statements is assigned a name which can be used with
      # the Operations API to monitor
      # progress. See the
      # operation_id field for more
      # details.
    &quot;operationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # If empty, the new update request is assigned an
        # automatically-generated operation ID. Otherwise, `operation_id`
        # is used to construct the name of the resulting
        # Operation.
        # 
        # Specifying an explicit operation ID simplifies determining
        # whether the statements were executed in the event that the
        # UpdateDatabaseDdl call is replayed,
        # or the return value is otherwise lost: the database and
        # `operation_id` fields can be combined to form the
        # name of the resulting
        # longrunning.Operation: `&lt;database&gt;/operations/&lt;operation_id&gt;`.
        # 
        # `operation_id` should be unique within the database, and must be
        # a valid identifier: `a-z*`. Note that
        # automatically-generated operation IDs always begin with an
        # underscore. If the named operation already exists,
        # UpdateDatabaseDdl returns
        # `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
    &quot;statements&quot;: [ # Required. DDL statements to be applied to the database.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
        # three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
        #
        # You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
        # [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
      &quot;details&quot;: [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
          # message types for APIs to use.

      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    },
    &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
