<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="activate">activate(name, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Activate a CertificateAuthority that is in state AWAITING_USER_ACTIVATION and is of type SUBORDINATE. After the parent Certificate Authority signs a certificate signing request from FetchCertificateAuthorityCsr, this method can complete the activation process.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name for this CertificateAuthority in the format `projects/*/locations/*/caPools/*/certificateAuthorities/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for CertificateAuthorityService.ActivateCertificateAuthority.
  &quot;pemCaCertificate&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The signed CA certificate issued from FetchCertificateAuthorityCsrResponse.pem_csr.
  &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. An ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and t he request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  &quot;subordinateConfig&quot;: { # Describes a subordinate CA&#x27;s issuers. This is either a resource name to a known issuing CertificateAuthority, or a PEM issuer certificate chain. # Required. Must include information about the issuer of &#x27;pem_ca_certificate&#x27;, and any further issuers until the self-signed CA.
    &quot;certificateAuthority&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. This can refer to a CertificateAuthority that was used to create a subordinate CertificateAuthority. This field is used for information and usability purposes only. The resource name is in the format `projects/*/locations/*/caPools/*/certificateAuthorities/*`.
    &quot;pemIssuerChain&quot;: { # This message describes a subordinate CA&#x27;s issuer certificate chain. This wrapper exists for compatibility reasons. # Required. Contains the PEM certificate chain for the issuers of this CertificateAuthority, but not pem certificate for this CA itself.
      &quot;pemCertificates&quot;: [ # Required. Expected to be in leaf-to-root order according to RFC 5246.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
    },
  },
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

      },

    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="fetch">fetch(name, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Fetch a certificate signing request (CSR) from a CertificateAuthority that is in state AWAITING_USER_ACTIVATION and is of type SUBORDINATE. The CSR must then be signed by the desired parent Certificate Authority, which could be another CertificateAuthority resource, or could be an on-prem certificate authority. See also ActivateCertificateAuthority.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The resource name for this CertificateAuthority in the format `projects/*/locations/*/caPools/*/certificateAuthorities/*`. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for CertificateAuthorityService.FetchCertificateAuthorityCsr.
  &quot;pemCsr&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The PEM-encoded signed certificate signing request (CSR).
