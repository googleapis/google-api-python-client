<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, appProfileId=None, body=None, ignoreWarnings=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates an app profile within an instance.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The unique name of the instance in which to create the new app profile. Values are of the form `projects/{project}/instances/{instance}`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A configuration object describing how Cloud Bigtable should treat traffic from a particular end user application.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Long form description of the use case for this AppProfile.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Strongly validated etag for optimistic concurrency control. Preserve the value returned from `GetAppProfile` when calling `UpdateAppProfile` to fail the request if there has been a modification in the mean time. The `update_mask` of the request need not include `etag` for this protection to apply. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag) and [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.3) for more details.
  &quot;multiClusterRoutingUseAny&quot;: { # Read/write requests are routed to the nearest cluster in the instance, and will fail over to the nearest cluster that is available in the event of transient errors or delays. Clusters in a region are considered equidistant. Choosing this option sacrifices read-your-writes consistency to improve availability. # Use a multi-cluster routing policy.
    &quot;clusterIds&quot;: [ # The set of clusters to route to. The order is ignored; clusters will be tried in order of distance. If left empty, all clusters are eligible.
