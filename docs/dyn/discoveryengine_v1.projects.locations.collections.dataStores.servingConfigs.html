  <pre>Answer query method.

Args:
  servingConfig: string, Required. The resource name of the Search serving config, such as `projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/*/servingConfigs/default_serving_config`, or `projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/*/servingConfigs/default_serving_config`. This field is used to identify the serving configuration name, set of models used to make the search. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for ConversationalSearchService.AnswerQuery method.
  &quot;answerGenerationSpec&quot;: { # Answer generation specification. # Answer generation specification.
    &quot;answerLanguageCode&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Language code for Answer. Use language tags defined by [BCP47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt). Note: This is an experimental feature.
    &quot;ignoreAdversarialQuery&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to filter out adversarial queries. The default value is `false`. Google employs search-query classification to detect adversarial queries. No answer is returned if the search query is classified as an adversarial query. For example, a user might ask a question regarding negative comments about the company or submit a query designed to generate unsafe, policy-violating output. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating answers for adversarial queries and return fallback messages instead.
    &quot;ignoreLowRelevantContent&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to filter out queries that have low relevance. If this field is set to `false`, all search results are used regardless of relevance to generate answers. If set to `true` or unset, the behavior will be determined automatically by the service.
    &quot;ignoreNonAnswerSeekingQuery&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to filter out queries that are not answer-seeking. The default value is `false`. Google employs search-query classification to detect answer-seeking queries. No answer is returned if the search query is classified as a non-answer seeking query. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating answers for non-answer seeking queries and return fallback messages instead.
    &quot;includeCitations&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to include citation metadata in the answer. The default value is `false`.
    &quot;modelSpec&quot;: { # Answer Generation Model specification. # Answer generation model specification.
      &quot;modelVersion&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Model version. If not set, it will use the default stable model. Allowed values are: stable, preview.
    },
    &quot;promptSpec&quot;: { # Answer generation prompt specification. # Answer generation prompt specification.
      &quot;preamble&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Customized preamble.
    },
  },
  &quot;asynchronousMode&quot;: True or False, # Asynchronous mode control. If enabled, the response will be returned with answer/session resource name without final answer. The API users need to do the polling to get the latest status of answer/session by calling ConversationalSearchService.GetAnswer or ConversationalSearchService.GetSession method.
  &quot;query&quot;: { # Defines a user inputed query. # Required. Current user query.

However, it does not necessarily mean that the boosted document will be the top result at all times, nor that other documents will be excluded. Results could still be shown even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your heavily favored but irrelevant documents. Setting to -1.0 gives the document a big demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant might still be shown. The document will have an upstream battle to get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely. Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored. Only one of the (condition, boost) combination or the boost_control_spec below are set. If both are set then the global boost is ignored and the more fine-grained boost_control_spec is applied.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="recommend">recommend(servingConfig, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Makes a recommendation, which requires a contextual user event.

Args:
  servingConfig: string, Required. Full resource name of a ServingConfig: `projects/*/locations/global/collections/*/engines/*/servingConfigs/*`, or `projects/*/locations/global/collections/*/dataStores/*/servingConfigs/*` One default serving config is created along with your recommendation engine creation. The engine ID is used as the ID of the default serving config. For example, for Engine `projects/*/locations/global/collections/*/engines/my-engine`, you can use `projects/*/locations/global/collections/*/engines/my-engine/servingConfigs/my-engine` for your RecommendationService.Recommend requests. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for Recommend method.
  &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Filter for restricting recommendation results with a length limit of 5,000 characters. Currently, only filter expressions on the `filter_tags` attribute is supported. Examples: * `(filter_tags: ANY(&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;) OR filter_tags: ANY(&quot;Hot&quot;, &quot;Cold&quot;))` * `(filter_tags: ANY(&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;)) AND NOT (filter_tags: ANY(&quot;Green&quot;))` If `attributeFilteringSyntax` is set to true under the `params` field, then attribute-based expressions are expected instead of the above described tag-based syntax. Examples: * (launguage: ANY(&quot;en&quot;, &quot;es&quot;)) AND NOT (categories: ANY(&quot;Movie&quot;)) * (available: true) AND (launguage: ANY(&quot;en&quot;, &quot;es&quot;)) OR (categories: ANY(&quot;Movie&quot;)) If your filter blocks all results, the API returns generic (unfiltered) popular Documents. If you only want results strictly matching the filters, set `strictFiltering` to `true` in RecommendRequest.params to receive empty results instead. Note that the API never returns Documents with `storageStatus` as `EXPIRED` or `DELETED` regardless of filter choices.
  &quot;pageSize&quot;: 42, # Maximum number of results to return. Set this property to the number of recommendation results needed. If zero, the service chooses a reasonable default. The maximum allowed value is 100. Values above 100 are set to 100.
  &quot;params&quot;: { # Additional domain specific parameters for the recommendations. Allowed values: * `returnDocument`: Boolean. If set to `true`, the associated Document object is returned in RecommendResponse.RecommendationResult.document. * `returnScore`: Boolean. If set to true, the recommendation score corresponding to each returned Document is set in RecommendResponse.RecommendationResult.metadata. The given score indicates the probability of a Document conversion given the user&#x27;s context and history. * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default. If set to `false`, the service returns generic (unfiltered) popular Documents instead of empty if your filter blocks all recommendation results. * `diversityLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be non-empty, then it needs to be one of: * `no-diversity` * `low-diversity` * `medium-diversity` * `high-diversity` * `auto-diversity` This gives request-level control and adjusts recommendation results based on Document category. * `attributeFilteringSyntax`: Boolean. False by default. If set to true, the `filter` field is interpreted according to the new, attribute-based syntax.

  },
  &quot;userEvent&quot;: { # UserEvent captures all metadata information Discovery Engine API needs to know about how end users interact with your website. # Required. Context about the user, what they are looking at and what action they took to trigger the Recommend request. Note that this user event detail won&#x27;t be ingested to userEvent logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write request is required for event logging. Don&#x27;t set UserEvent.user_pseudo_id or UserEvent.user_info.user_id to the same fixed ID for different users. If you are trying to receive non-personalized recommendations (not recommended; this can negatively impact model performance), instead set UserEvent.user_pseudo_id to a random unique ID and leave UserEvent.user_info.user_id unset.
    &quot;attributes&quot;: { # Extra user event features to include in the recommendation model. These attributes must NOT contain data that needs to be parsed or processed further, e.g. JSON or other encodings. If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events, also include them in the user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and events provided with prediction requests. This lets the Discovery Engine API use those custom attributes when training models and serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality. This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 5,000 characters. * For text attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. For product recommendations, an example of extra user information is `traffic_channel`, which is how a user arrives at the site. Users can arrive at the site by coming to the site directly, coming through Google search, or in other ways.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: { # A custom attribute that is not explicitly modeled in a resource, e.g. UserEvent.
        &quot;numbers&quot;: [ # The numerical values of this custom attribute. For example, `[2.3, 15.4]` when the key is &quot;lengths_cm&quot;. Exactly one of CustomAttribute.text or CustomAttribute.numbers should be set. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.

Highly recommended for user events that are the result of RecommendationService.Recommend. This field enables accurate attribution of recommendation model performance. The value must be one of: * RecommendResponse.attribution_token for events that are the result of RecommendationService.Recommend. * SearchResponse.attribution_token for events that are the result of SearchService.Search. This token enables us to accurately attribute page view or conversion completion back to the event and the particular predict response containing this clicked/purchased product. If user clicks on product K in the recommendation results, pass RecommendResponse.attribution_token as a URL parameter to product K&#x27;s page. When recording events on product K&#x27;s page, log the RecommendResponse.attribution_token to this field.
    &quot;completionInfo&quot;: { # Detailed completion information including completion attribution token and clicked completion info. # CompletionService.CompleteQuery details related to the event. This field should be set for `search` event when autocomplete function is enabled and the user clicks a suggestion for search.

Optional. Only required for user events whose data store can&#x27;t by determined by UserEvent.engine or UserEvent.documents. If data store is set in the parent of write/import/collect user event requests, this field can be omitted.
    &quot;directUserRequest&quot;: True or False, # Should set to true if the request is made directly from the end user, in which case the UserEvent.user_info.user_agent can be populated from the HTTP request. This flag should be set only if the API request is made directly from the end user such as a mobile app (and not if a gateway or a server is processing and pushing the user events). This should not be set when using the JavaScript tag in UserEventService.CollectUserEvent.
    &quot;documents&quot;: [ # List of Documents associated with this user event. This field is optional except for the following event types: * `view-item` * `add-to-cart` * `purchase` * `media-play` * `media-complete` In a `search` event, this field represents the documents returned to the end user on the current page (the end user may have not finished browsing the whole page yet). When a new page is returned to the end user, after pagination/filtering/ordering even for the same query, a new `search` event with different UserEvent.documents is desired.
      { # Detailed document information associated with a user event.
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Document resource ID.
        &quot;joined&quot;: True or False, # Output only. Whether the referenced Document can be found in the data store.

        &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Document URI - only allowed for website data stores.
      },
    ],
    &quot;engine&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Engine resource name, in the form of `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection_id}/engines/{engine_id}`. Optional. Only required for Engine produced user events. For example, user events from blended search.
    &quot;eventTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Only required for UserEventService.ImportUserEvents method. Timestamp of when the user event happened.
    &quot;eventType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. User event type. Allowed values are: Generic values: * `search`: Search for Documents. * `view-item`: Detailed page view of a Document. * `view-item-list`: View of a panel or ordered list of Documents. * `view-home-page`: View of the home page. * `view-category-page`: View of a category page, e.g. Home &gt; Men &gt; Jeans Retail-related values: * `add-to-cart`: Add an item(s) to cart, e.g. in Retail online shopping * `purchase`: Purchase an item(s) Media-related values: * `media-play`: Start/resume watching a video, playing a song, etc. * `media-complete`: Finished or stopped midway through a video, song, etc.
    &quot;filter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The filter syntax consists of an expression language for constructing a predicate from one or more fields of the documents being filtered. One example is for `search` events, the associated SearchRequest may contain a filter expression in SearchRequest.filter conforming to https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering. Similarly, for `view-item-list` events that are generated from a RecommendRequest, this field may be populated directly from RecommendRequest.filter conforming to https://google.aip.dev/160#filtering. The value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 1,000 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
    &quot;mediaInfo&quot;: { # Media-specific user event information. # Media-specific info.
      &quot;mediaProgressDuration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The media progress time in seconds, if applicable. For example, if the end user has finished 90 seconds of a playback video, then MediaInfo.media_progress_duration.seconds should be set to 90.
      &quot;mediaProgressPercentage&quot;: 3.14, # Media progress should be computed using only the media_progress_duration relative to the media total length. This value must be between `[0, 1.0]` inclusive. If this is not a playback or the progress cannot be computed (e.g. ongoing livestream), this field should be unset.

Category pages include special pages such as sales or promotions. For instance, a special sale page may have the category hierarchy: `&quot;pageCategory&quot; : &quot;Sales &gt; 2017 Black Friday Deals&quot;`. Required for `view-category-page` events. Other event types should not set this field. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
      &quot;pageviewId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique ID of a web page view. This should be kept the same for all user events triggered from the same pageview. For example, an item detail page view could trigger multiple events as the user is browsing the page. The `pageview_id` property should be kept the same for all these events so that they can be grouped together properly. When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in automatically.
      &quot;referrerUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The referrer URL of the current page. When using the client side event reporting with JavaScript pixel and Google Tag Manager, this value is filled in automatically. However, some browser privacy restrictions may cause this field to be empty.

This mixes the event history of those users together, which results in degraded model quality. The field must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length limit of 128 characters. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned. The field should not contain PII or user-data. We recommend to use Google Analytics [Client ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference#clientId) for this field.

The resource name of the Search serving config, such as `projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/engines/*/servingConfigs/default_serving_config`, or `projects/*/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/default_data_store/servingConfigs/default_serving_config`. This field is used to identify the serving configuration name, set of models used to make the search. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

However, it does not necessarily mean that the boosted document will be the top result at all times, nor that other documents will be excluded. Results could still be shown even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your heavily favored but irrelevant documents. Setting to -1.0 gives the document a big demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant might still be shown. The document will have an upstream battle to get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely. Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored. Only one of the (condition, boost) combination or the boost_control_spec below are set.

Only applied if the DataStore is set to DataStore.ContentConfig.CONTENT_REQUIRED or DataStore.solution_types is SOLUTION_TYPE_CHAT. An extractive segment is a text segment extracted from the original document that is relevant to the search query, and, in general, more verbose than an extractive answer. The segment could then be used as input for LLMs to generate summaries and answers. If the number of matching segments is less than `max_extractive_segment_count`, return all of the segments.

Google employs search-query classification to detect adversarial queries. No summary is returned if the search query is classified as an adversarial query. For example, a user might ask a question regarding negative comments about the company or submit a query designed to generate unsafe, policy-violating output. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating summaries for adversarial queries and return fallback messages instead.

Google employs search-query classification to detect summary-seeking queries. No summary is returned if the search query is classified as a non-summary seeking query. For example, `why is the sky blue` and `Who is the best soccer player in the world?` are summary-seeking queries, but `SFO airport` and `world cup 2026` are not. They are most likely navigational queries. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating summaries for non-summary seeking queries and return fallback messages instead.
      &quot;includeCitations&quot;: True or False, # Specifies whether to include citations in the summary. The default value is `false`. When this field is set to `true`, summaries include in-line citation numbers. Example summary including citations: BigQuery is Google Cloud&#x27;s fully managed and completely serverless enterprise data warehouse [1]. BigQuery supports all data types, works across clouds, and has built-in machine learning and business intelligence, all within a unified platform [2, 3]. The citation numbers refer to the returned search results and are 1-indexed. For example, [1] means that the sentence is attributed to the first search result. [2, 3] means that the sentence is attributed to both the second and third search results.

If set to true, the position of this facet among all facets in the response is determined automatically. If dynamic facets are enabled, it is ordered together. If set to false, the position of this facet in the response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before the facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets. For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it&#x27;s not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response is determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * &quot;rating&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = true * &quot;price&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false * &quot;brands&quot;, enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of the facets in the response can be (&quot;price&quot;, &quot;brands&quot;, &quot;rating&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;) or (&quot;price&quot;, &quot;brands&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;rating&quot;) depends on how API orders &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;rating&quot; facets. However, notice that &quot;price&quot; and &quot;brands&quot; are always ranked at first and second position because their enable_dynamic_position is false.

Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results. Using this field does not affect what search results are returned. For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet &quot;Red&quot; and 200 documents with the color facet &quot;Blue&quot;. A query containing the filter &quot;color:ANY(&quot;Red&quot;)&quot; and having &quot;color&quot; as FacetKey.key would by default return only &quot;Red&quot; documents in the search results, and also return &quot;Red&quot; with count 100 as the only color facet. Although there are also blue documents available, &quot;Blue&quot; would not be shown as an available facet value. If &quot;color&quot; is listed in &quot;excludedFilterKeys&quot;, then the query returns the facet values &quot;Red&quot; with count 100 and &quot;Blue&quot; with count 200, because the &quot;color&quot; key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field doesn&#x27;t affect search results, the search results are still correctly filtered to return only &quot;Red&quot; documents. A maximum of 100 values are allowed. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.
