Managers are responsible for managing the workers in this pool as well as customers&#x27; data labeling jobs associated with this pool. Customers create specialist pool as well as start data labeling jobs on Cloud, managers and workers handle the jobs using CrowdCompute console.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The user-defined name of the SpecialistPool. The name can be up to 128 characters long and can consist of any UTF-8 characters. This field should be unique on project-level.
