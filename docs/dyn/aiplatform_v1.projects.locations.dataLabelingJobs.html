    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, filter=None, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, readMask=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists DataLabelingJobs in a Location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent of the DataLabelingJob. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}` (required)
  filter: string, The standard list filter. Supported fields: * `display_name` supports `=`, `!=` comparisons, and `:` wildcard. * `state` supports `=`, `!=` comparisons. * `create_time` supports `=`, `!=`,`&lt;`, `&lt;=`,`&gt;`, `&gt;=` comparisons. `create_time` must be in RFC 3339 format. * `labels` supports general map functions that is: `labels.key=value` - key:value equality `labels.key:* - key existence Some examples of using the filter are: * `state=&quot;JOB_STATE_SUCCEEDED&quot; AND display_name:&quot;my_job_*&quot;` * `state!=&quot;JOB_STATE_FAILED&quot; OR display_name=&quot;my_job&quot;` * `NOT display_name=&quot;my_job&quot;` * `create_time&gt;&quot;2021-05-18T00:00:00Z&quot;` * `labels.keyA=valueA` * `labels.keyB:*`
  orderBy: string, A comma-separated list of fields to order by, sorted in ascending order by default. Use `desc` after a field name for descending.
  pageSize: integer, The standard list page size.
  pageToken: string, The standard list page token.
  readMask: string, Mask specifying which fields to read. FieldMask represents a set of symbolic field paths. For example, the mask can be `paths: &quot;name&quot;`. The &quot;name&quot; here is a field in DataLabelingJob. If this field is not set, all fields of the DataLabelingJob are returned.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
