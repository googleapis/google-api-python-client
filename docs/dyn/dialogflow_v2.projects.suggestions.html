  <pre>Generates and returns a summary for a conversation that does not have a resource created for it.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource to charge for the Summary&#x27;s generation. Format: `projects//locations/`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The request message for Conversations.GenerateStatelessSummary.
  &quot;conversationProfile&quot;: { # Defines the services to connect to incoming Dialogflow conversations. # Required. A ConversationProfile containing information required for Summary generation. Required fields: {language_code, security_settings} Optional fields: {agent_assistant_config}

      &quot;agent&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. ID of the Dialogflow agent environment to use. This project needs to either be the same project as the conversation or you need to grant `service-@gcp-sa-dialogflow.iam.gserviceaccount.com` the `Dialogflow API Service Agent` role in this project. - For ES agents, use format: `projects//locations//agent/environments/`. If environment is not specified, the default `draft` environment is used. Refer to [DetectIntentRequest](/dialogflow/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.dialogflow.v2#google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.DetectIntentRequest) for more details. - For CX agents, use format `projects//locations//agents//environments/`.

      &quot;model&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Which Speech model to select. Select the model best suited to your domain to get best results. If a model is not explicitly specified, then Dialogflow auto-selects a model based on other parameters in the SpeechToTextConfig and Agent settings.

Refer to [Cloud Speech API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/basics#select-model) for more details. If you specify a model, the following models typically have the best performance: - phone_call (best for Agent Assist and telephony) - latest_short (best for Dialogflow non-telephony) - command_and_search Leave this field unspecified to use [Agent Speech settings](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent#settings-speech) for model selection.

If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement.
