    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, privateConnectionId=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Use this method to create a private connectivity configuration.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent that owns the collection of PrivateConnections. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The PrivateConnection resource is used to establish private connectivity between Datastream and a customer&#x27;s network.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The create time of the resource.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Display name.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # Represent a user-facing Error. # Output only. In case of error, the details of the error in a user-friendly format.
    &quot;details&quot;: { # Additional information about the error.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
    &quot;errorTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time when the error occurred.
    &quot;errorUuid&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A unique identifier for this specific error, allowing it to be traced throughout the system in logs and API responses.
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A message containing more information about the error that occurred.
    &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A title that explains the reason for the error.
  },
  &quot;labels&quot;: { # Labels.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The resource&#x27;s name.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the Private Connection.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The update time of the resource.
  &quot;vpcPeeringConfig&quot;: { # The VPC Peering configuration is used to create VPC peering between Datastream and the consumer&#x27;s VPC. # VPC Peering Config.
    &quot;subnet&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A free subnet for peering. (CIDR of /29) TODO(b/172995841) add validators.
    &quot;vpc&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. Fully qualified name of the VPC that Datastream will peer to. Format: `projects/{project}/global/{networks}/{name}`
  },
}

  privateConnectionId: string, Required. The private connectivity identifier.
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a network API call.
  &quot;done&quot;: True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available.
  &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors). # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
    &quot;code&quot;: 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

      },

  },
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the private connectivity configuration to delete. (required)
  force: boolean, Optional. If set to true, any child routes that belong to this PrivateConnection will also be deleted.
  requestId: string, Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.
