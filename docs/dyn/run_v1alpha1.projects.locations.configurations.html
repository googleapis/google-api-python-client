  <pre>Rpc to get information about a configuration.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the configuration being retrieved. If needed, replace {namespace_id} with the project ID. (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:
