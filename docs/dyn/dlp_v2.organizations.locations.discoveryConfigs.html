<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="list">list(parent, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists discovery configurations.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Parent resource name. The format of this value is as follows: `projects/`PROJECT_ID`/locations/`LOCATION_ID The following example `parent` string specifies a parent project with the identifier `example-project`, and specifies the `europe-west3` location for processing data: parent=projects/example-project/locations/europe-west3 (required)
  orderBy: string, Comma separated list of config fields to order by, followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case insensitive. The default sorting order is ascending. Redundant space characters are insignificant. Example: `name asc,update_time, create_time desc` Supported fields are: - `last_run_time`: corresponds to the last time the DiscoveryConfig ran. - `name`: corresponds to the DiscoveryConfig&#x27;s name. - `status`: corresponds to DiscoveryConfig&#x27;s status.
  pageSize: integer, Size of the page. This value can be limited by a server.
  pageToken: string, Page token to continue retrieval. Comes from the previous call to ListDiscoveryConfigs. `order_by` field must not change for subsequent calls.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
