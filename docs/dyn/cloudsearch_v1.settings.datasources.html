Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
    &quot;error&quot;: { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
        # three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.
        #
        # You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the
        # [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the

    &quot;metadata&quot;: { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        # Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method that returns a
        # long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
