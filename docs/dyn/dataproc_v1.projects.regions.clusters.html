    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

  gracefulDecommissionTimeout: string, Optional. Timeout for graceful YARN decomissioning. Graceful decommissioning allows removing nodes from the cluster without interrupting jobs in progress. Timeout specifies how long to wait for jobs in progress to finish before forcefully removing nodes (and potentially interrupting jobs). Default timeout is 0 (for forceful decommission), and the maximum allowed timeout is 1 day.Only supported on Dataproc image versions 1.2 and higher.
  requestId: string, Optional. A unique id used to identify the request. If the server receives two UpdateClusterRequest requests with the same id, then the second request will be ignored and the first google.longrunning.Operation created and stored in the backend is returned.It is recommended to always set this value to a UUID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).The id must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The maximum length is 40 characters.
  updateMask: string, Required. Specifies the path, relative to Cluster, of the field to update. For example, to change the number of workers in a cluster to 5, the update_mask parameter would be specified as config.worker_config.num_instances, and the PATCH request body would specify the new value, as follows:
{
  "config":{
    "workerConfig":{
      "numInstances":"5"
    }
  }
}
Similarly, to change the number of preemptible workers in a cluster to 5, the update_mask parameter would be config.secondary_worker_config.num_instances, and the PATCH request body would be set as follows:
{
  "config":{
    "secondaryWorkerConfig":{
      "numInstances":"5"
    }
  }
}
<strong>Note:</strong> Currently, only the following fields can be updated:<table>  <tbody>  <tr>  <td><strong>Mask</strong></td>  <td><strong>Purpose</strong></td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td><strong><em>labels</em></strong></td>  <td>Update labels</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td><strong><em>config.worker_config.num_instances</em></strong></td>  <td>Resize primary worker group</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td><strong><em>config.secondary_worker_config.num_instances</em></strong></td>  <td>Resize secondary worker group</td>  </tr>  </tbody>  </table>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a NOT_FOUND error.Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See the operation documentation for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for TestIamPermissions method.
    "permissions": [ # The set of permissions to check for the resource. Permissions with wildcards (such as '*' or 'storage.*') are not allowed. For more information see IAM Overview (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for TestIamPermissions method.
    "permissions": [ # A subset of TestPermissionsRequest.permissions that the caller is allowed.
      "A String",
    ],
  }</pre>
