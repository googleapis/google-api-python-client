  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The description of the notification config (max of 1024 characters).
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The relative resource name of this notification config. See: https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name Example: &quot;organizations/{organization_id}/notificationConfigs/notify_public_bucket&quot;.
  &quot;pubsubTopic&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The Pub/Sub topic to send notifications to. Its format is &quot;projects/[project_id]/topics/[topic]&quot;.
