  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="search">search(parent, orderBy=None, pageSize=None, pageToken=None, query=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>SearchAuthorizedViewSets

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent resource of the AuthorizedViews. If the parent is set to `-`, all AuthorizedViews under the location will be returned. (required)
  orderBy: string, Optional. The order by expression to order authorized views listed in the response.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. The maximum number of view to return in the response. If the value is zero, the service will select a default size. A call might return fewer objects than requested. A non-empty `next_page_token` in the response indicates that more data is available.
  pageToken: string, Optional. The value returned by the last `ListAuthorizedViewsResponse`. This value indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListAuthorizedViews` call and that the system should return the next page of data.
  query: string, Optional. The query expression to search authorized views.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # The response from a ListAuthorizedViews request.
  &quot;authorizedViews&quot;: [ # The AuthorizedViews under the parent.
    { # An AuthorizedView represents a view of accessible Insights resources (for example, Conversation and Scorecard). Who have read access to the AuthorizedView resource will have access to these Insight resources as well.
      &quot;conversationFilter&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A filter to reduce conversation results to a specific subset. The AuthorizedView&#x27;s assigned permission (read/write) could be applied to the subset of conversations. If conversation_filter is empty, there is no restriction on the conversations that the AuthorizedView can access. Having *authorizedViews.get* access to the AuthorizedView means having the same read/write access to the Conversations (as well as metadata/annotations liked to the conversation) that this AuthorizedView has.
      &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The time at which the authorized view was created.
      &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Display Name. Limit 64 characters.
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identifier. The resource name of the AuthorizedView. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/authorizedViewSets/{authorized_view_set}/authorizedViews/{authorized_view}
      &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The most recent time at which the authorized view was updated.
    },
  ],
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A token, which can be sent as `page_token` to retrieve the next page. If this field is omitted, there are no subsequent pages.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="search_next">search_next()</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.
