    <code class="details" id="batchGetAssetsHistory">batchGetAssetsHistory(parent, contentType=None, assetNames=None, readTimeWindow_startTime=None, readTimeWindow_endTime=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Batch gets the update history of assets that overlap a time window.
For RESOURCE content, this API outputs history with asset in both
non-delete or deleted status.
For IAM_POLICY content, this API outputs history when the asset and its
attached IAM POLICY both exist. This can create gaps in the output history.
If a specified asset does not exist, this API returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT
error.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. It can only be an
organization number (such as "organizations/123"), a project ID (such as
"projects/my-project-id")", or a project number (such as "projects/12345"). (required)
  contentType: string, Required. The content type.
  assetNames: string, A list of the full names of the assets. For example:
`//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1`.
See [Resource
Names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name)
for more info.

The request becomes a no-op if the asset name list is empty, and the max
size of the asset name list is 100 in one request. (repeated)
  readTimeWindow_startTime: string, Start time of the time window (exclusive).
  readTimeWindow_endTime: string, End time of the time window (inclusive).
Current timestamp if not specified.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="exportAssets">exportAssets(parent, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage
location. The output format is newline-delimited JSON.
This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API allowing you
to keep track of the export.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. The relative name of the root asset. This can only be an
organization number (such as "organizations/123"), a project ID (such as
"projects/my-project-id"), a project number (such as "projects/12345"), or
a folder number (such as "folders/123"). (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Export asset request.
    "assetTypes": [ # A list of asset types of which to take a snapshot for. For example:
        # "google.compute.Disk". If specified, only matching assets will be returned.
        # See [Introduction to Cloud Asset
        # Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview)
        # for all supported asset types.
      "A String",
    ],
    "outputConfig": { # Output configuration for export assets destination. # Required. Output configuration indicating where the results will be output
        # to. All results will be in newline delimited JSON format.
      "gcsDestination": { # A Cloud Storage location. # Destination on Cloud Storage.
        "uriPrefix": "A String", # The uri prefix of all generated Cloud Storage objects. For example:
            # "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix". Each object uri is in format:
            # "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/<asset type>/<shard number> and only
            # contains assets for that type. <shard number> starts from 0. For example:
            # "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix/google.compute.disk/0" is the first
            # shard of output objects containing all google.compute.disk assets.
            # An INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned if file with the same name
            # "gs://bucket_name/object_name_prefix" already exists.
        "uri": "A String", # The uri of the Cloud Storage object. It's the same uri that is used by
            # gsutil. For example: "gs://bucket_name/object_name". See [Viewing and
            # Editing Object
            # Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/viewing-editing-metadata)

      },
    },
    "contentType": "A String", # Asset content type. If not specified, no content but the asset name will be
        # returned.
    "readTime": "A String", # Timestamp to take an asset snapshot. This can only be set to a timestamp
        # between 2018-10-02 UTC (inclusive) and the current time. If not specified,
        # the current time will be used. Due to delays in resource data collection
        # and indexing, there is a volatile window during which running the same
        # query may get different results.
  }

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # This resource represents a long-running operation that is the result of a
      # network API call.
    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
        # contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.

      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "error": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for # The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.
        # different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
        # used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        #
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        #
        # # Overview
        #
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
        # message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        #
        # # Language mapping
        #
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        #
        # # Other uses
        #
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        #
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        #
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        #     errors.
        #
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        #
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        #     each error sub-response.
        #
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
        #
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
      "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
          # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
          # google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
      "code": 42, # The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
      "details": [ # A list of messages that carry the error details.  There is a common set of
          # message types for APIs to use.
        {
          "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
        },
      ],
    },
    "done": True or False, # If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
        # If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is
        # available.
    "response": { # The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the original
        # method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
        # `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
        # `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
        # methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
        # is the original method name.  For example, if the original method name
        # is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is
        # `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
      "a_key": "", # Properties of the object. Contains field @type with type URL.
    },
    "name": "A String", # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that
        # originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the
        # `name` should have the format of `operations/some/unique/name`.
