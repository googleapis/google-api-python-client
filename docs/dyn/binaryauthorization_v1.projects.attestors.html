Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent of this attestor. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An attestor that attests to container image artifacts. An existing attestor cannot be modified except where indicated.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A descriptive comment. This field may be updated. The field may be displayed in chooser dialogs.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A checksum, returned by the server, that can be sent on update requests to ensure the attestor has an up-to-date value before attempting to update it. See https://google.aip.dev/154.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource name, in the format: `projects/*/attestors/*`. This field may not be updated.

    &quot;delegationServiceAccountEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. This field will contain the service account email address that this Attestor will use as the principal when querying Container Analysis. Attestor administrators must grant this service account the IAM role needed to read attestations from the note_reference in Container Analysis (`containeranalysis.notes.occurrences.viewer`). This email address is fixed for the lifetime of the Attestor, but callers should not make any other assumptions about the service account email; future versions may use an email based on a different naming pattern.

BinAuthz computes this ID as the OpenPGP RFC4880 V4 fingerprint, represented as upper-case hex. If `id` is provided by the caller, it will be overwritten by the API-calculated ID.
        &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. A descriptive comment. This field may be updated.
        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID of this public key.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
  &quot;bindings&quot;: [ # Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

See the service documentation for additional information. # The condition that is associated with this binding. If the condition evaluates to `true`, then this binding applies to the current request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

      &quot;members&quot;: [ # Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. * `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`: An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts).

  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="testIamPermissions">testIamPermissions(resource, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization checking. This operation may &quot;fail open&quot; without warning.

Args:
  resource: string, REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy detail is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for `TestIamPermissions` method.
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [ # The set of permissions to check for the `resource`. Permissions with wildcards (such as `*` or `storage.*`) are not allowed. For more information see [IAM Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview#permissions).

  <pre>Returns whether the given Attestation for the given image URI was signed by the given Attestor

Args:
  attestor: string, Required. The resource name of the Attestor of the occurrence, in the format `projects/*/attestors/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for ValidationHelperV1.ValidateAttestationOccurrence.
  &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the authority to which this attestation is attached is primarily useful for lookup (how to find this attestation if you already know the authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (for which authority this attestation was intended to sign. # Required. An AttestationOccurrence to be checked that it can be verified by the Attestor. It does not have to be an existing entity in Container Analysis. It must otherwise be a valid AttestationOccurrence.
    &quot;jwts&quot;: [ # One or more JWTs encoding a self-contained attestation. Each JWT encodes the payload that it verifies within the JWT itself. Verifier implementation SHOULD ignore the `serialized_payload` field when verifying these JWTs. If only JWTs are present on this AttestationOccurrence, then the `serialized_payload` SHOULD be left empty. Each JWT SHOULD encode a claim specific to the `resource_uri` of this Occurrence, but this is not validated by Grafeas metadata API implementations. The JWT itself is opaque to Grafeas.

See `Signature` in common.proto for more details on signature structure and verification.
      { # Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy). Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be &quot;attached&quot; (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any &quot;attached&quot; payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).
        &quot;publicKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The identifier for the public key that verifies this signature. * The `public_key_id` is required. * The `public_key_id` SHOULD be an RFC3986 conformant URI. * When possible, the `public_key_id` SHOULD be an immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest.

The payload that this signature verifies MUST be unambiguously provided with the Signature during verification. A wrapper message might provide the payload explicitly. Alternatively, a message might have a canonical serialization that can always be unambiguously computed to derive the payload.
