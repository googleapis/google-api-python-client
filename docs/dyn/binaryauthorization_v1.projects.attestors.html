Args:
  parent: string, Required. The parent of this attestor. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    &quot;delegationServiceAccountEmail&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. This field will contain the service account email address that this Attestor will use as the principal when querying Container Analysis. Attestor administrators must grant this service account the IAM role needed to read attestations from the note_reference in Container Analysis (`containeranalysis.notes.occurrences.viewer`). This email address is fixed for the lifetime of the Attestor, but callers should not make any other assumptions about the service account email; future versions may use an email based on a different naming pattern.

This field may not be updated. An attestation by this attestor is stored as a Grafeas Attestation.Authority Occurrence that names a container image and that links to this Note. Grafeas is an external dependency.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { &quot;bindings&quot;: [ { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;, &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;, &quot;domain:google.com&quot;, &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot; ] }, { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;, &quot;members&quot;: [ &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot; ], &quot;condition&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;)&quot;, } } ], &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#x27;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#x27;) - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
  &quot;version&quot;: 42, # Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

    <code class="details" id="validateAttestationOccurrence">validateAttestationOccurrence(attestor, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Returns whether the given Attestation for the given image URI was signed by the given Attestor

Args:
  attestor: string, Required. The resource name of the Attestor of the occurrence, in the format `projects/*/attestors/*`. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for ValidationHelperV1.ValidateAttestationOccurrence.
  &quot;attestation&quot;: { # Occurrence that represents a single &quot;attestation&quot;. The authenticity of an attestation can be verified using the attached signature. If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance, the authority to which this attestation is attached is primarily useful for lookup (how to find this attestation if you already know the authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (for which authority this attestation was intended to sign. # Required. An AttestationOccurrence to be checked that it can be verified by the Attestor. It does not have to be an existing entity in Container Analysis. It must otherwise be a valid AttestationOccurrence.
    &quot;jwts&quot;: [ # One or more JWTs encoding a self-contained attestation. Each JWT encodes the payload that it verifies within the JWT itself. Verifier implementation SHOULD ignore the `serialized_payload` field when verifying these JWTs. If only JWTs are present on this AttestationOccurrence, then the `serialized_payload` SHOULD be left empty. Each JWT SHOULD encode a claim specific to the `resource_uri` of this Occurrence, but this is not validated by Grafeas metadata API implementations. The JWT itself is opaque to Grafeas.
      {
        &quot;compactJwt&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The compact encoding of a JWS, which is always three base64 encoded strings joined by periods. For details, see: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515.html#section-3.1
      },
    ],
    &quot;serializedPayload&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The serialized payload that is verified by one or more `signatures`.
    &quot;signatures&quot;: [ # One or more signatures over `serialized_payload`. Verifier implementations should consider this attestation message verified if at least one `signature` verifies `serialized_payload`. See `Signature` in common.proto for more details on signature structure and verification.
      { # Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy). Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be &quot;attached&quot; (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any &quot;attached&quot; payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).
        &quot;publicKeyId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The identifier for the public key that verifies this signature. * The `public_key_id` is required. * The `public_key_id` SHOULD be an RFC3986 conformant URI. * When possible, the `public_key_id` SHOULD be an immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest. Examples of valid `public_key_id`s: OpenPGP V4 public key fingerprint: * &quot;openpgp4fpr:74FAF3B861BDA0870C7B6DEF607E48D2A663AEEA&quot; See https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/openpgp4fpr for more details on this scheme. RFC6920 digest-named SubjectPublicKeyInfo (digest of the DER serialization): * &quot;ni:///sha-256;cD9o9Cq6LG3jD0iKXqEi_vdjJGecm_iXkbqVoScViaU&quot; * &quot;nih:///sha-256;703f68f42aba2c6de30f488a5ea122fef76324679c9bf89791ba95a1271589a5&quot;
        &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The content of the signature, an opaque bytestring. The payload that this signature verifies MUST be unambiguously provided with the Signature during verification. A wrapper message might provide the payload explicitly. Alternatively, a message might have a canonical serialization that can always be unambiguously computed to derive the payload.
      },
    ],
  },
  &quot;occurrenceNote&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The resource name of the Note to which the containing Occurrence is associated.
  &quot;occurrenceResourceUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The URI of the artifact (e.g. container image) that is the subject of the containing Occurrence.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Response message for ValidationHelperV1.ValidateAttestationOccurrence.
  &quot;denialReason&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The reason for denial if the Attestation couldn&#x27;t be validated.
