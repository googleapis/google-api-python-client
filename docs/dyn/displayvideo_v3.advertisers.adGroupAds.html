  <pre>Lists ad group ads.

Args:
  advertiserId: string, Required. The ID of the advertiser the ad groups belongs to. (required)
  filter: string, Optional. Allows filtering by custom ad group ad fields. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` and `OR`. A sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * All fields must use the `EQUALS (=)` operator. Supported fields: * `adGroupId` * `displayName` * `entityStatus` * `adGroupAdId` Examples: * All ad group ads under an ad group: `adGroupId=&quot;1234&quot;` * All ad group ads under an ad group with an entityStatus of `ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE` or `ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED`: `(entityStatus=&quot;ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE&quot; OR entityStatus=&quot;ENTITY_STATUS_PAUSED&quot;) AND adGroupId=&quot;12345&quot;` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters. Reference our [filter `LIST` requests](/display-video/api/guides/how-tos/filters) guide for more information.
  orderBy: string, Optional. Field by which to sort the list. Acceptable values are: * `displayName` (default) * `entityStatus` The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix &quot;desc&quot; should be added to the field name. Example: `displayName desc`.
  pageSize: integer, Optional. Requested page size. Must be between `1` and `100`. If unspecified will default to `100`. Returns error code `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if an invalid value is specified.
  pageToken: string, Optional. A token identifying a page of results the server should return. Typically, this is the value of next_page_token returned from the previous call to `ListAdGroupAds` method. If not specified, the first page of results will be returned.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
