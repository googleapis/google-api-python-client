    &quot;cacheControl&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Cache-Control directive for the object data. If omitted, and the object is accessible to all anonymous users, the default will be public, max-age=3600.
    &quot;componentCount&quot;: 42, # Number of underlying components that make up this object. Components are accumulated by compose operations.

    &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the object.
    &quot;eventBasedHold&quot;: True or False, # Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold&#x27;s release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.
    &quot;generation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The content generation of this object. Used for object versioning.
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID of the object, including the bucket name, object name, and generation number.

    &quot;md5Hash&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # MD5 hash of the data; encoded using base64. For more information about using the MD5 hash, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices.
    &quot;mediaLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Media download link.
    &quot;metadata&quot;: { # User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An individual metadata entry.
    },
    &quot;metageneration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The version of the metadata for this object at this generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular object.
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the object. Required if not specified by URL parameter.
    &quot;owner&quot;: { # The owner of the object. This will always be the uploader of the object.
      &quot;entity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The entity, in the form user-userId.
      &quot;entityId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID for the entity.
    },
    &quot;retentionExpirationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time that the object&#x27;s retention period expires. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).
    &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The link to this object.
    &quot;size&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Content-Length of the data in bytes.
    &quot;storageClass&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Storage class of the object.
    &quot;temporaryHold&quot;: True or False, # Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.
    &quot;timeCreated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.
    &quot;timeDeleted&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The deletion time of the object in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted.
    &quot;timeStorageClassUpdated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time at which the object&#x27;s storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated.
    &quot;updated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format. Set initially to object creation time and then updated whenever any metadata of the object changes. This includes changes made by a requester, such as modifying custom metadata, as well as changes made by Cloud Storage on behalf of a requester, such as changing the storage class based on an Object Lifecycle Configuration.

      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The source object&#x27;s name. All source objects must reside in the same bucket.
      &quot;objectPreconditions&quot;: { # Conditions that must be met for this operation to execute.
        &quot;ifGenerationMatch&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Only perform the composition if the generation of the source object that would be used matches this value. If this value and a generation are both specified, they must be the same value or the call will fail.
      },
    },
  ],
}

  destinationPredefinedAcl: string, Apply a predefined set of access controls to the destination object.
    Allowed values

Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold&#x27;s release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.

    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An individual metadata entry.
  },
  &quot;metageneration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The version of the metadata for this object at this generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular object.

  },
  &quot;retentionExpirationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time that the object&#x27;s retention period expires. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).

A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.
  &quot;timeCreated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.
  &quot;timeDeleted&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The deletion time of the object in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted.
  &quot;timeStorageClassUpdated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time at which the object&#x27;s storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated.

  &quot;eventBasedHold&quot;: True or False, # Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold&#x27;s release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.

This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The link to this object.

Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.
  &quot;timeCreated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.
  &quot;timeDeleted&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The deletion time of the object in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted.
  &quot;timeStorageClassUpdated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time at which the object&#x27;s storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated.
  &quot;updated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format. Set initially to object creation time and then updated whenever any metadata of the object changes. This includes changes made by a requester, such as modifying custom metadata, as well as changes made by Cloud Storage on behalf of a requester, such as changing the storage class based on an Object Lifecycle Configuration.

Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.

  <pre>Retrieves a list of objects matching the criteria.

Args:
  bucket: string, Name of the bucket in which to look for objects. (required)
  delimiter: string, Returns results in a directory-like mode. items will contain only objects whose names, aside from the prefix, do not contain delimiter.

  endOffset: string, Filter results to objects whose names are lexicographically before endOffset. If startOffset is also set, the objects listed will have names between startOffset (inclusive) and endOffset (exclusive).
  includeTrailingDelimiter: boolean, If true, objects that end in exactly one instance of delimiter will have their metadata included in items in addition to prefixes.
  maxResults: integer, Maximum number of items plus prefixes to return in a single page of responses. As duplicate prefixes are omitted, fewer total results may be returned than requested. The service will use this parameter or 1,000 items, whichever is smaller.
  pageToken: string, A previously-returned page token representing part of the larger set of results to view.
  prefix: string, Filter results to objects whose names begin with this prefix.

}

  destinationKmsKeyName: string, Resource name of the Cloud KMS key, of the form projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key, that will be used to encrypt the object. Overrides the object metadata&#x27;s kms_key_name value, if any.
  destinationPredefinedAcl: string, Apply a predefined set of access controls to the destination object.
    Allowed values
      authenticatedRead - Object owner gets OWNER access, and allAuthenticatedUsers get READER access.
      bucketOwnerFullControl - Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team owners get OWNER access.
      bucketOwnerRead - Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team owners get READER access.

      projectPrivate - Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team members get access according to their roles.
      publicRead - Object owner gets OWNER access, and allUsers get READER access.
  ifGenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the object&#x27;s current generation matches the given value. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there are no live versions of the object.
  ifGenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the object&#x27;s current generation does not match the given value. If no live object exists, the precondition fails. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there is a live version of the object.
  ifMetagenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the destination object&#x27;s current metageneration matches the given value.
  ifMetagenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the destination object&#x27;s current metageneration does not match the given value.
  ifSourceGenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object&#x27;s current generation matches the given value.
  ifSourceGenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object&#x27;s current generation does not match the given value.

  ifSourceMetagenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object&#x27;s current metageneration does not match the given value.
  maxBytesRewrittenPerCall: string, The maximum number of bytes that will be rewritten per rewrite request. Most callers shouldn&#x27;t need to specify this parameter - it is primarily in place to support testing. If specified the value must be an integral multiple of 1 MiB (1048576). Also, this only applies to requests where the source and destination span locations and/or storage classes. Finally, this value must not change across rewrite calls else you&#x27;ll get an error that the rewriteToken is invalid.
  projection: string, Set of properties to return. Defaults to noAcl, unless the object resource specifies the acl property, when it defaults to full.
    Allowed values
      full - Include all properties.
      noAcl - Omit the owner, acl property.
  rewriteToken: string, Include this field (from the previous rewrite response) on each rewrite request after the first one, until the rewrite response &#x27;done&#x27; flag is true. Calls that provide a rewriteToken can omit all other request fields, but if included those fields must match the values provided in the first rewrite request.
  sourceGeneration: string, If present, selects a specific revision of the source object (as opposed to the latest version, the default).
  userProject: string, The project to be billed for this request. Required for Requester Pays buckets.

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A rewrite response.

  },
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the object.
  &quot;eventBasedHold&quot;: True or False, # Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold&#x27;s release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.
  &quot;generation&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The content generation of this object. Used for object versioning.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID of the object, including the bucket name, object name, and generation number.

  &quot;kmsKeyName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Not currently supported. Specifying the parameter causes the request to fail with status code 400 - Bad Request.
  &quot;md5Hash&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # MD5 hash of the data; encoded using base64. For more information about using the MD5 hash, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices.
  &quot;mediaLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Media download link.
  &quot;metadata&quot;: { # User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An individual metadata entry.
  },
  &quot;metageneration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The version of the metadata for this object at this generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular object.
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The name of the object. Required if not specified by URL parameter.
  &quot;owner&quot;: { # The owner of the object. This will always be the uploader of the object.
    &quot;entity&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The entity, in the form user-userId.
    &quot;entityId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The ID for the entity.
  },
  &quot;retentionExpirationTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time that the object&#x27;s retention period expires. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).
  &quot;selfLink&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The link to this object.
  &quot;size&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Content-Length of the data in bytes.
  &quot;storageClass&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Storage class of the object.
  &quot;temporaryHold&quot;: True or False, # Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.
  &quot;timeCreated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.
  &quot;timeDeleted&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The deletion time of the object in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted.
  &quot;timeStorageClassUpdated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The time at which the object&#x27;s storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated.
  &quot;updated&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format. Set initially to object creation time and then updated whenever any metadata of the object changes. This includes changes made by a requester, such as modifying custom metadata, as well as changes made by Cloud Storage on behalf of a requester, such as changing the storage class based on an Object Lifecycle Configuration.

  <pre>Watch for changes on all objects in a bucket.

Args:
  bucket: string, Name of the bucket in which to look for objects. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # An notification channel used to watch for resource changes.
  &quot;address&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The address where notifications are delivered for this channel.
  &quot;expiration&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Date and time of notification channel expiration, expressed as a Unix timestamp, in milliseconds. Optional.
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A UUID or similar unique string that identifies this channel.
  &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;api#channel&quot;, # Identifies this as a notification channel used to watch for changes to a resource, which is &quot;api#channel&quot;.
  &quot;params&quot;: { # Additional parameters controlling delivery channel behavior. Optional.
    &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Declares a new parameter by name.
  },
  &quot;payload&quot;: True or False, # A Boolean value to indicate whether payload is wanted. Optional.
  &quot;resourceId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An opaque ID that identifies the resource being watched on this channel. Stable across different API versions.
  &quot;resourceUri&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # A version-specific identifier for the watched resource.
  &quot;token&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An arbitrary string delivered to the target address with each notification delivered over this channel. Optional.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The type of delivery mechanism used for this channel.
}

  delimiter: string, Returns results in a directory-like mode. items will contain only objects whose names, aside from the prefix, do not contain delimiter. Objects whose names, aside from the prefix, contain delimiter will have their name, truncated after the delimiter, returned in prefixes. Duplicate prefixes are omitted.
  endOffset: string, Filter results to objects whose names are lexicographically before endOffset. If startOffset is also set, the objects listed will have names between startOffset (inclusive) and endOffset (exclusive).
  includeTrailingDelimiter: boolean, If true, objects that end in exactly one instance of delimiter will have their metadata included in items in addition to prefixes.
  maxResults: integer, Maximum number of items plus prefixes to return in a single page of responses. As duplicate prefixes are omitted, fewer total results may be returned than requested. The service will use this parameter or 1,000 items, whichever is smaller.
  pageToken: string, A previously-returned page token representing part of the larger set of results to view.
  prefix: string, Filter results to objects whose names begin with this prefix.
  projection: string, Set of properties to return. Defaults to noAcl.
    Allowed values
      full - Include all properties.
      noAcl - Omit the owner, acl property.
  startOffset: string, Filter results to objects whose names are lexicographically equal to or after startOffset. If endOffset is also set, the objects listed will have names between startOffset (inclusive) and endOffset (exclusive).
  userProject: string, The project to be billed for this request. Required for Requester Pays buckets.
  versions: boolean, If true, lists all versions of an object as distinct results. The default is false. For more information, see Object Versioning.
