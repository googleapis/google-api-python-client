        "size": "A String", # Content-Length of the data in bytes.
        "timeDeleted": "A String", # The deletion time of the object in RFC 3339 format. Will be returned if and only if this version of the object has been deleted.
        "timeCreated": "A String", # The creation time of the object in RFC 3339 format.
        "md5Hash": "A String", # MD5 hash of the data; encoded using base64. For more information about using the MD5 hash, see Hashes and ETags: Best Practices.

        "etag": "A String", # HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the object.
        "temporaryHold": True or False, # Whether an object is under temporary hold. While this flag is set to true, the object is protected against deletion and overwrites. A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.
        "metadata": { # User-provided metadata, in key/value pairs.
          "a_key": "A String", # An individual metadata entry.
        },
        "updated": "A String", # The modification time of the object metadata in RFC 3339 format.
        "contentType": "A String", # Content-Type of the object data. If an object is stored without a Content-Type, it is served as application/octet-stream.

          "keySha256": "A String", # SHA256 hash value of the encryption key.
        },
        "metageneration": "A String", # The version of the metadata for this object at this generation. Used for preconditions and for detecting changes in metadata. A metageneration number is only meaningful in the context of a particular generation of a particular object.
        "timeStorageClassUpdated": "A String", # The time at which the object's storage class was last changed. When the object is initially created, it will be set to timeCreated.
        "retentionExpirationTime": "A String", # A server-determined value that specifies the earliest time that the object's retention period expires. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).
        "eventBasedHold": True or False, # Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.
        "kind": "storage#object", # The kind of item this is. For objects, this is always storage#object.
        "name": "A String", # The name of the object. Required if not specified by URL parameter.

        "selfLink": "A String", # The link to this object.
        "contentDisposition": "A String", # Content-Disposition of the object data.
        "storageClass": "A String", # Storage class of the object.
      },
    "sourceObjects": [ # The list of source objects that will be concatenated into a single object.
      {
        "generation": "A String", # The generation of this object to use as the source.
        "name": "A String", # The source object's name. All source objects must reside in the same bucket.
        "objectPreconditions": { # Conditions that must be met for this operation to execute.
          "ifGenerationMatch": "A String", # Only perform the composition if the generation of the source object that would be used matches this value. If this value and a generation are both specified, they must be the same value or the call will fail.
        },
      },
    ],
  }

  ifGenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation matches the given value. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there are no live versions of the object.
  ifMetagenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current metageneration matches the given value.
  userProject: string, The project to be billed for this request. Required for Requester Pays buckets.
  destinationPredefinedAcl: string, Apply a predefined set of access controls to the destination object.

      authenticatedRead - Object owner gets OWNER access, and allAuthenticatedUsers get READER access.
      bucketOwnerFullControl - Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team owners get OWNER access.
      bucketOwnerRead - Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team owners get READER access.
      private - Object owner gets OWNER access.
      projectPrivate - Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team members get access according to their roles.
      publicRead - Object owner gets OWNER access, and allUsers get READER access.
  kmsKeyName: string, Resource name of the Cloud KMS key, of the form projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key, that will be used to encrypt the object. Overrides the object metadata's kms_key_name value, if any.
  provisionalUserProject: string, The project to be billed for this request if the target bucket is requester-pays bucket.

A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.

    },

Note 1: This field is not provided for objects with an active event-based hold, since retention expiration is unknown until the hold is removed. Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).
    "eventBasedHold": True or False, # Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.

      noAcl - Omit the owner, acl property.
  kmsKeyName: string, Resource name of the Cloud KMS key, of the form projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key, that will be used to encrypt the object. Overrides the object metadata's kms_key_name value, if any.
  media_body: string, The filename of the media request body, or an instance of a MediaUpload object.
  predefinedAcl: string, Apply a predefined set of access controls to this object.
    Allowed values

  provisionalUserProject: string, The project to be billed for this request if the target bucket is requester-pays bucket.
  ifGenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation does not match the given value. If no live object exists, the precondition fails. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there is a live version of the object.

  ifMetagenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current metageneration matches the given value.
  userProject: string, The project to be billed for this request. Required for Requester Pays buckets.
  contentEncoding: string, If set, sets the contentEncoding property of the final object to this value. Setting this parameter is equivalent to setting the contentEncoding metadata property. This can be useful when uploading an object with uploadType=media to indicate the encoding of the content being uploaded.
  media_mime_type: string, The MIME type of the media request body, or an instance of a MediaUpload object.
  ifMetagenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current metageneration does not match the given value.

A common use case of this flag is regulatory investigations where objects need to be retained while the investigation is ongoing. Note that unlike event-based hold, temporary hold does not impact retention expiration time of an object.

Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).
    "eventBasedHold": True or False, # Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.

  projection: string, Set of properties to return. Defaults to noAcl, unless the object resource specifies the acl property, when it defaults to full.
    Allowed values
      full - Include all properties.
      noAcl - Omit the owner, acl property.
  sourceGeneration: string, If present, selects a specific revision of the source object (as opposed to the latest version, the default).
  maxBytesRewrittenPerCall: string, The maximum number of bytes that will be rewritten per rewrite request. Most callers shouldn't need to specify this parameter - it is primarily in place to support testing. If specified the value must be an integral multiple of 1 MiB (1048576). Also, this only applies to requests where the source and destination span locations and/or storage classes. Finally, this value must not change across rewrite calls else you'll get an error that the rewriteToken is invalid.
  ifSourceGenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object's current generation does not match the given value.
  ifGenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation matches the given value. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there are no live versions of the object.
  ifSourceMetagenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object's current metageneration does not match the given value.
  destinationKmsKeyName: string, Resource name of the Cloud KMS key, of the form projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key, that will be used to encrypt the object. Overrides the object metadata's kms_key_name value, if any.
  rewriteToken: string, Include this field (from the previous rewrite response) on each rewrite request after the first one, until the rewrite response 'done' flag is true. Calls that provide a rewriteToken can omit all other request fields, but if included those fields must match the values provided in the first rewrite request.
  provisionalUserProject: string, The project to be billed for this request if the target bucket is requester-pays bucket.
  ifGenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the object's current generation does not match the given value. If no live object exists, the precondition fails. Setting to 0 makes the operation succeed only if there is a live version of the object.
  ifMetagenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the destination object's current metageneration matches the given value.
  userProject: string, The project to be billed for this request. Required for Requester Pays buckets.
  destinationPredefinedAcl: string, Apply a predefined set of access controls to the destination object.
    Allowed values
      authenticatedRead - Object owner gets OWNER access, and allAuthenticatedUsers get READER access.
      bucketOwnerFullControl - Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team owners get OWNER access.
      bucketOwnerRead - Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team owners get READER access.
      private - Object owner gets OWNER access.
      projectPrivate - Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team members get access according to their roles.
      publicRead - Object owner gets OWNER access, and allUsers get READER access.
  ifSourceGenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object's current generation matches the given value.
  ifSourceMetagenerationMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the source object's current metageneration matches the given value.
  ifMetagenerationNotMatch: string, Makes the operation conditional on whether the destination object's current metageneration does not match the given value.

Note 2: This value can be provided even when temporary hold is set (so that the user can reason about policy without having to first unset the temporary hold).
    "eventBasedHold": True or False, # Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being released (set to false), such objects will be subject to bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.
