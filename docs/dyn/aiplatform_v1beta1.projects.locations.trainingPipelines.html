  <pre>Cancels a TrainingPipeline. Starts asynchronous cancellation on the TrainingPipeline. The server makes a best effort to cancel the pipeline, but success is not guaranteed. Clients can use PipelineService.GetTrainingPipeline or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the pipeline completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the TrainingPipeline is not deleted; instead it becomes a pipeline with a TrainingPipeline.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`, and TrainingPipeline.state is set to `CANCELLED`.

Args:
  name: string, Required. The name of the TrainingPipeline to cancel. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/trainingPipelines/{training_pipeline}` (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request message for PipelineService.CancelTrainingPipeline.
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when Vertex AI receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`&#x27;s ports field. If you don&#x27;t specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you deploy this Model to an Endpoint: /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment variable](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#aip-variables).) * DEPLOYED_MODEL: DeployedModel.id of the `DeployedModel`.
