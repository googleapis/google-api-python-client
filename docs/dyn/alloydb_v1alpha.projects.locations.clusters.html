  clusterId: string, Required. ID of the requesting object.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server ignores the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

      2 - v2 error format

Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

  },
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

}

  allowMissing: boolean, Optional. If set to true, update succeeds even if cluster is not found. In that case, a new cluster is created and `update_mask` is ignored.
  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server ignores the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Cluster resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.
  validateOnly: boolean, Optional. If set, performs request validation, for example, permission checks and any other type of validation, but does not actually execute the create request.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, ignores the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
