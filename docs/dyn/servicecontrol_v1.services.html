This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.quota` permission on the specified service. For more information, see [Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam). **NOTE:** The client **must** fail-open on server errors `INTERNAL`, `UNKNOWN`, `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.

  <code><a href="#check">check(serviceName, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</a></code></p>
<p class="firstline">Checks whether an operation on a service should be allowed to proceed based on the configuration of the service and related policies. It must be called before the operation is executed. If feasible, the client should cache the check results and reuse them for 60 seconds. In case of any server errors, the client should rely on the cached results for much longer time to avoid outage. WARNING: There is general 60s delay for the configuration and policy propagation, therefore callers MUST NOT depend on the `Check` method having the latest policy information.

If feasible, the client should aggregate reporting data for up to 5 seconds to reduce API traffic. Limiting aggregation to 5 seconds is to reduce data loss during client crashes.

Args:
  serviceName: string, Name of the service as specified in the service configuration. For example, `&quot;pubsub.googleapis.com&quot;`. See google.api.Service for the definition of a service name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    &quot;serviceConfigId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Specifies which version of service configuration should be used to process the request. If unspecified or no matching version can be found, the latest one will be used.
    &quot;allocateOperation&quot;: { # Represents information regarding a quota operation. # Operation that describes the quota allocation.
      &quot;operationId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Identity of the operation. This is expected to be unique within the scope of the service that generated the operation, and guarantees idempotency in case of retries. In order to ensure best performance and latency in the Quota backends, operation_ids are optimally associated with time, so that related operations can be accessed fast in storage. For this reason, the recommended token for services that intend to operate at a high QPS is Unix time in nanos + UUID
      &quot;quotaMetrics&quot;: [ # Represents information about this operation. Each MetricValueSet corresponds to a metric defined in the service configuration. The data type used in the MetricValueSet must agree with the data type specified in the metric definition.

If a request has such duplicated MetricValue instances, the entire request is rejected with an invalid argument error. This field is mutually exclusive with method_name.

  <pre>Checks whether an operation on a service should be allowed to proceed based on the configuration of the service and related policies. It must be called before the operation is executed. If feasible, the client should cache the check results and reuse them for 60 seconds. In case of any server errors, the client should rely on the cached results for much longer time to avoid outage. WARNING: There is general 60s delay for the configuration and policy propagation, therefore callers MUST NOT depend on the `Check` method having the latest policy information. NOTE: the CheckRequest has the size limit of 64KB. This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.check` permission on the specified service. For more information, see [Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam).
