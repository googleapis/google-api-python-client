    <code class="details" id="allocateQuota">allocateQuota(serviceName, body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Attempts to allocate quota for the specified consumer. It should be called
before the operation is executed.

This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.quota`
permission on the specified service. For more information, see
[Google Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam).

**NOTE:** the client code **must** fail-open if the server returns one
of the following quota errors:
-   `PROJECT_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`
-   `SERVICE_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`
-   `BILLING_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`
-   `QUOTA_SYSTEM_UNAVAILABLE`

The server may inject above errors to prohibit any hard dependency
on the quota system.

`"pubsub.googleapis.com"`.

  <pre>Checks an operation with Google Service Control to decide whether
the given operation should proceed. It should be called before the
operation is executed.

If feasible, the client should cache the check results and reuse them for
60 seconds. In case of server errors, the client can rely on the cached
results for longer time.

NOTE: the `CheckRequest` has the size limit of 64KB.

This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.check` permission
on the specified service. For more information, see
[Google Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam).

  <pre>Releases previously allocated quota done through AllocateQuota method.

This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.quota`
permission on the specified service. For more information, see
[Google Cloud IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam).

**NOTE:** the client code **must** fail-open if the server returns one
of the following quota errors:
-   `PROJECT_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`
-   `SERVICE_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`
-   `BILLING_STATUS_UNAVAILABLE`
-   `QUOTA_SYSTEM_UNAVAILABLE`

The server may inject above errors to prohibit any hard dependency
on the quota system.

  <pre>Reports operation results to Google Service Control, such as logs and
metrics. It should be called after an operation is completed.

If feasible, the client should aggregate reporting data for up to 5
seconds to reduce API traffic. Limiting aggregation to 5 seconds is to
reduce data loss during client crashes. Clients should carefully choose
the aggregation time window to avoid data loss risk more than 0.01%
for business and compliance reasons.

NOTE: the `ReportRequest` has the size limit of 1MB.

        "status": { # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different # Details of the error when processing the `Operation`.
            # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
            # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
            #
            # - Simple to use and understand for most users
            # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
            #
            # # Overview
            #
            # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
            # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
            # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
            # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
            # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
            # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
            # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
            # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
            # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
            #
            # # Language mapping
            #
            # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
            # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
            # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
            # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
            # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
            #
            # # Other uses
            #
            # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
            # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
            # consistent developer experience across different environments.
            #
            # Example uses of this error model include:
            #
            # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
            #     it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
            #     errors.
            #
            # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
            #     have a `Status` message for error reporting.
            #
            # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
            #     `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
            #     each error sub-response.
            #
            # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
            #     results in its response, the status of those operations should be
            #     represented directly using the `Status` message.
            #
            # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
            #     be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
          "message": "A String", # A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
              # user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the

  <pre>Unlike rate quota, allocation quota does not get refilled periodically.
So, it is possible that the quota usage as seen by the service differs from
what the One Platform considers the usage is. This is expected to happen
only rarely, but over time this can accumulate. Services can invoke
StartReconciliation and EndReconciliation to correct this usage drift, as
described below:
1. Service sends StartReconciliation with a timestamp in future for each
   metric that needs to be reconciled. The timestamp being in future allows
   to account for in-flight AllocateQuota and ReleaseQuota requests for the
   same metric.
2. One Platform records this timestamp and starts tracking subsequent
   AllocateQuota and ReleaseQuota requests until EndReconciliation is
   called.
3. At or after the time specified in the StartReconciliation, service
   sends EndReconciliation with the usage that needs to be reconciled to.
4. One Platform adjusts its own record of usage for that metric to the
   value specified in EndReconciliation by taking in to account any
   allocation or release between StartReconciliation and EndReconciliation.

Signals the quota controller that the service wants to perform a usage
reconciliation as specified in the request.
