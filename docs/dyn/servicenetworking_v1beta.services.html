<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addSubnetwork">addSubnetwork(parent, body=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>For service producers, provisions a new subnet in a peered service&#x27;s shared VPC network in the requested region and with the requested size that&#x27;s expressed as a CIDR range (number of leading bits of ipV4 network mask). The method checks against the assigned allocated ranges to find a non-conflicting IP address range. The method will reuse a subnet if subsequent calls contain the same subnet name, region, and prefix length. This method will make producer&#x27;s tenant project to be a shared VPC service project as needed. The response from the `get` operation will be of type `Subnetwork` if the operation successfully completes.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. A tenant project in the service producer organization, in the following format: services/{service}/{collection-id}/{resource-id}. {collection-id} is the cloud resource collection type that represents the tenant project. Only `projects` are supported. {resource-id} is the tenant project numeric id, such as `123456`. {service} the name of the peering service, such as `service-peering.example.com`. This service must already be enabled in the service consumer&#x27;s project. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request to create a subnetwork in a previously peered service network.
  &quot;consumer&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A resource that represents the service consumer, such as `projects/123456`. The project number can be different from the value in the consumer network parameter. For example, the network might be part of a Shared VPC network. In those cases, Service Networking validates that this resource belongs to that Shared VPC.
  &quot;consumerNetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the service consumer&#x27;s VPC network. The network must have an existing private connection that was provisioned through the connections.create method. The name must be in the following format: `projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}`, where {project} is a project number, such as `12345`. {network} is the name of a VPC network in the project.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # An optional description of the subnet.
  &quot;ipPrefixLength&quot;: 42, # Required. The prefix length of the subnet&#x27;s IP address range. Use CIDR range notation, such as `30` to provision a subnet with an `x.x.x.x/30` CIDR range. The IP address range is drawn from a pool of available ranges in the service consumer&#x27;s allocated range.
  &quot;region&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of a [region](/compute/docs/regions-zones) for the subnet, such `europe-west1`.
  &quot;requestedAddress&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The starting address of a range. The address must be a valid IPv4 address in the x.x.x.x format. This value combined with the IP prefix range is the CIDR range for the subnet. The range must be within the allocated range that is assigned to the private connection. If the CIDR range isn&#x27;t available, the call fails.
  &quot;subnetwork&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A name for the new subnet. For information about the naming requirements, see [subnetwork](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/subnetworks) in the Compute API documentation.
  &quot;subnetworkUsers&quot;: [ # A list of members that are granted the `compute.networkUser` role on the subnet.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with `operations/{unique_id}`.
  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
