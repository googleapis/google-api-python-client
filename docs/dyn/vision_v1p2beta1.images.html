<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="asyncBatchAnnotate">asyncBatchAnnotate(body, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Run asynchronous image detection and annotation for a list of images.

Progress and results can be retrieved through the
`google.longrunning.Operations` interface.
`Operation.metadata` contains `OperationMetadata` (metadata).
`Operation.response` contains `AsyncBatchAnnotateImagesResponse` (results).

This service will write image annotation outputs to json files in customer
GCS bucket, each json file containing BatchAnnotateImagesResponse proto.

Args:
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Request for async image annotation for a list of images.
    "outputConfig": { # The desired output location and metadata. # Required. The desired output location and metadata (e.g. format).
      "batchSize": 42, # The max number of response protos to put into each output JSON file on
          # Google Cloud Storage.
          # The valid range is [1, 100]. If not specified, the default value is 20.
          #
          # For example, for one pdf file with 100 pages, 100 response protos will
          # be generated. If `batch_size` = 20, then 5 json files each
          # containing 20 response protos will be written under the prefix
          # `gcs_destination`.`uri`.

            # either case, the uri should be unique because in order to get all of the

            # you provide.
            #
            # Examples:
            #

            # will be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the

            #
            # *    Directory Prefix: gs://bucket-name/some/location/   The output files

            # output files could be anything because there was no filename prefix
            # specified.
            #
            # If multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each of
            # which contains some subset of the full list of AnnotateImageResponse.

    "metadata": { # Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It typically
