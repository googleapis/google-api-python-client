    <code class="details" id="create">create(parent, body=None, requestId=None, sourceId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Creates a new source in a given project and location.

Args:
  parent: string, Required. Value for parent. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Source represents an object from which asset information is streamed to Migration Center.
  &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the source was created.
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Free-text description.
  &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # User-friendly display name.
  &quot;errorFrameCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. The number of frames that were reported by the source and contained errors.
  &quot;managed&quot;: True or False, # If `true`, the source is managed by other service(s).
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The full name of the source.
  &quot;pendingFrameCount&quot;: 42, # Output only. Number of frames that are still being processed.
  &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # The information confidence of the source. The higher the value, the higher the confidence.
  &quot;state&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The state of the source.
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Data source type.
  &quot;updateTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The timestamp when the source was last updated.
}

  requestId: string, Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  sourceId: string, Required. User specified ID for the source. It will become the last component of the source name. The ID must be unique within the project, must conform with RFC-1034, is restricted to lower-cased letters, and has a maximum length of 63 characters. The ID must match the regular expression: `[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?`.

  &quot;response&quot;: { # The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.
