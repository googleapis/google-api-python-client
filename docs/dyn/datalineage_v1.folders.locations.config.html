  <pre>Get the Config for a given resource.

Args:
  name: string, Required. REQUIRED: The resource name of the config to be fetched. Format: `organizations/{organization_id}/locations/global/config` `folders/{folder_id}/locations/global/config` `projects/{project_id}/locations/global/config` `projects/{project_number}/locations/global/config` (required)
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Configuration for Data Lineage. Defines different configuration options for Lineage customers to control behaviour of lineage systems.
  &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a config from overwriting each other. It is required that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform config updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetConfig`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `UpdateConfig` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the config. If an `etag` is not provided in the call to `UpdateConfig`, then the existing config, if any, will be overwritten.
  &quot;ingestion&quot;: { # Defines how Lineage should be ingested for a given resource. # Optional. Ingestion rule for Data Lineage ingestion.
