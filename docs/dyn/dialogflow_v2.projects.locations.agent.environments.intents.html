        { # Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person says to you &quot;they are orange&quot;, you need context in order to understand what &quot;they&quot; is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about context, see the [Contexts guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
          &quot;lifespanCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. The number of conversational query requests after which the context expires. The default is `0`. If set to `0`, the context expires immediately. Contexts expire automatically after 20 minutes if there are no matching queries.
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The unique identifier of the context. Format: `projects//agent/sessions//contexts/`, or `projects//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`. The `Context ID` is always converted to lowercase, may only contain characters in a-zA-Z0-9_-% and may be at most 250 bytes long. If `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;draft&#x27; environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default &#x27;-&#x27; user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by Dialogflow. You should not use these contexts or create contexts with these names: * `__system_counters__` * `*_id_dialog_context` * `*_dialog_params_size`
          &quot;parameters&quot;: { # Optional. The collection of parameters associated with this context. Depending on your protocol or client library language, this is a map, associative array, symbol table, dictionary, or JSON object composed of a collection of (MapKey, MapValue) pairs: - MapKey type: string - MapKey value: parameter name - MapValue type: - If parameter&#x27;s entity type is a composite entity: map - Else: depending on parameter value type, could be one of string, number, boolean, null, list or map - MapValue value: - If parameter&#x27;s entity type is a composite entity: map from composite entity property names to property values - Else: parameter value
            &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;&quot;, # Properties of the object.
          },
        },
      ],
      &quot;parameters&quot;: [ # Optional. The collection of parameters associated with the intent.
        { # Represents intent parameters.
          &quot;defaultValue&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The default value to use when the `value` yields an empty result. Default values can be extracted from contexts by using the following syntax: `#context_name.parameter_name`.
          &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The name of the parameter.
          &quot;entityTypeDisplayName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The name of the entity type, prefixed with `@`, that describes values of the parameter. If the parameter is required, this must be provided.
          &quot;isList&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether the parameter represents a list of values.
          &quot;mandatory&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether the parameter is required. That is, whether the intent cannot be completed without collecting the parameter value.
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The unique identifier of this parameter.
          &quot;prompts&quot;: [ # Optional. The collection of prompts that the agent can present to the user in order to collect a value for the parameter.
            &quot;A String&quot;,
          ],
          &quot;value&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The definition of the parameter value. It can be: - a constant string, - a parameter value defined as `$parameter_name`, - an original parameter value defined as `$parameter_name.original`, - a parameter value from some context defined as `#context_name.parameter_name`.
        },
      ],
      &quot;parentFollowupIntentName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Read-only after creation. The unique identifier of the parent intent in the chain of followup intents. You can set this field when creating an intent, for example with CreateIntent or BatchUpdateIntents, in order to make this intent a followup intent. It identifies the parent followup intent. Format: `projects//agent/intents/`.
      &quot;priority&quot;: 42, # Optional. The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities. - If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the `Normal` priority in the console. - If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.
      &quot;resetContexts&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether to delete all contexts in the current session when this intent is matched.
      &quot;rootFollowupIntentName&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. Read-only. The unique identifier of the root intent in the chain of followup intents. It identifies the correct followup intents chain for this intent. We populate this field only in the output. Format: `projects//agent/intents/`.
      &quot;trainingPhrases&quot;: [ # Optional. The collection of examples that the agent is trained on.
        { # Represents an example that the agent is trained on.
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Output only. The unique identifier of this training phrase.
          &quot;parts&quot;: [ # Required. The ordered list of training phrase parts. The parts are concatenated in order to form the training phrase. Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`, and `user_defined` fields are all set.
            { # Represents a part of a training phrase.
              &quot;alias&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The parameter name for the value extracted from the annotated part of the example. This field is required for annotated parts of the training phrase.
              &quot;entityType&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The entity type name prefixed with `@`. This field is required for annotated parts of the training phrase.
              &quot;text&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The text for this part.
              &quot;userDefined&quot;: True or False, # Optional. Indicates whether the text was manually annotated. This field is set to true when the Dialogflow Console is used to manually annotate the part. When creating an annotated part with the API, you must set this to true.
            },
          ],
          &quot;timesAddedCount&quot;: 42, # Optional. Indicates how many times this example was added to the intent. Each time a developer adds an existing sample by editing an intent or training, this counter is increased.
          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The type of the training phrase.
        },
      ],
      &quot;webhookState&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. Indicates whether webhooks are enabled for the intent.
    },
  ],
  &quot;nextPageToken&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Token to retrieve the next page of results, or empty if there are no more results in the list.
