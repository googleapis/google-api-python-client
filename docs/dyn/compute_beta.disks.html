<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="addResourcePolicies">addResourcePolicies(project, zone, disk, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Adds existing resource policies to a disk. You can only add one policy which will be applied to this disk for scheduling snapshot creation.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  disk: string, The disk name for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;resourcePolicies&quot;: [ # Full or relative path to the resource policy to be added to this disk. You can only specify one resource policy.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format

    <code class="details" id="aggregatedList">aggregatedList(project, filter=None, includeAllScopes=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves an aggregated list of persistent disks.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  includeAllScopes: boolean, Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, zone, filter=None, maxResults=None, orderBy=None, pageToken=None, returnPartialSuccess=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves a list of persistent disks contained within the specified zone.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, `&lt;=`, `&gt;=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;) OR (cpuPlatform = &quot;Intel Broadwell&quot;) AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq &#x27;single quoted literal&#x27;` `fieldname eq &quot;double quoted literal&quot;` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne &quot;literal&quot;)` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name &quot;instance&quot;, you would use `name ne .*instance`.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy=&quot;creationTimestamp desc&quot;`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  returnPartialSuccess: boolean, Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

        Args:
          previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
          previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

        Returns:
          A request object that you can call &#x27;execute()&#x27; on to request the next
          page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="removeResourcePolicies">removeResourcePolicies(project, zone, disk, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Removes resource policies from a disk.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  disk: string, The disk name for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;resourcePolicies&quot;: [ # Resource policies to be removed from this disk.
    &quot;A String&quot;,
  ],
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="resize">resize(project, zone, disk, body=None, requestId=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Resizes the specified persistent disk. You can only increase the size of the disk.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  disk: string, The name of the persistent disk. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{
  &quot;sizeGb&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The new size of the persistent disk, which is specified in GB.
}

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource.

    { # An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

  <pre>Sets the labels on a disk. To learn more about labels, read the Labeling Resources documentation.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  zone: string, The name of the zone for this request. (required)
  resource: string, Name or id of the resource for this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

  &quot;labelFingerprint&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The fingerprint of the previous set of labels for this resource, used to detect conflicts. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  &quot;sourceStorageObject&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # The full Google Cloud Storage URI where the disk image is stored. This file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name ends in .tar.gz or virtual machine disk whose name ends in vmdk. Valid URIs may start with gs:// or https://storage.googleapis.com/. This flag is not optimized for creating multiple disks from a source storage object. To create many disks from a source storage object, use gcloud compute images import instead.

}

  paths: string, A parameter (repeated)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
  updateMask: string, update_mask indicates fields to be updated as part of this request.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource.
