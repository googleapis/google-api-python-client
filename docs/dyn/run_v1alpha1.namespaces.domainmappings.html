    <code class="details" id="delete">delete(name, kind=None, propagationPolicy=None, orphanDependents=None, apiVersion=None, x__xgafv=None)</code>
  <pre>Rpc to delete a domain mapping.

Args:
  name: string, The name of the domain mapping being deleted. If needed, replace
{namespace_id} with the project ID. (required)
  kind: string, Cloud Run currently ignores this parameter.
  propagationPolicy: string, Specifies the propagation policy of delete. Cloud Run currently ignores
this setting, and deletes in the background. Please see
kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/ for
more information.
  orphanDependents: boolean, Deprecated.
Specifies the cascade behavior on delete.
Cloud Run only supports cascading behavior, so this must be false.
This attribute is deprecated, and is now replaced with PropagationPolicy
See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/46659 for more info.
  apiVersion: string, Cloud Run currently ignores this parameter.
  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
      # empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
      # or the response type of an API method. For instance:
      #
      #     service Foo {
      #       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
      #     }

  <pre>Rpc to list domain mappings.

Args:
  parent: string, The project ID or project number from which the domain mappings should be
listed. (required)
  labelSelector: string, Allows to filter resources based on a label. Supported operations are
=, !=, exists, in, and notIn.

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
  resourceVersion: string, The baseline resource version from which the list or watch operation should
start. Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  limit: integer, The maximum number of records that should be returned.
  watch: boolean, Flag that indicates that the client expects to watch this resource as well.
Not currently used by Cloud Run.
  continue: string, Optional encoded string to continue paging.
  fieldSelector: string, Allows to filter resources based on a specific value for a field name.
Send this in a query string format. i.e. 'metadata.name%3Dlorem'.
Not currently used by Cloud Run.

Returns:
  An object of the form:
