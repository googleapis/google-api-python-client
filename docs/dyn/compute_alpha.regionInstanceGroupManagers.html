<h3>Method Details</h3>
<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="abandonInstances">abandonInstances(project, region, instanceGroupManager, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Flags the specified instances to be immediately removed from the managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the status of the abandoning action with the listmanagedinstances method.

If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, Name of the managed instance group. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{
    "instances": [ # The URLs of one or more instances to abandon. This can be a full URL or a partial URL, such as zones/[ZONE]/instances/[INSTANCE_NAME].
      "A String",
    ],
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  <pre>Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be immediately deleted. The instances are also removed from any target pools of which they were a member. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you delete. The deleteInstances operation is marked DONE if the deleteInstances request is successful.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="list">list(project, region, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the list of managed instance groups that are contained within the specified region.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    { # Contains a list of managed instance groups.
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

    <code class="details" id="listErrors">listErrors(project, region, instanceGroupManager, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all errors thrown by actions on instances for a given regional managed instance group.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. This should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, The name of the managed instance group. It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long integer: must match regexp pattern: (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|[1-9][0-9]{0,19}. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request.

    <code class="details" id="listManagedInstances_next">listManagedInstances_next(previous_request, previous_response)</code>
  <pre>Retrieves the next page of results.

Args:
  previous_request: The request for the previous page. (required)
  previous_response: The response from the request for the previous page. (required)

Returns:
  A request object that you can call 'execute()' on to request the next
  page. Returns None if there are no more items in the collection.

</div>

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="listPerInstanceConfigs">listPerInstanceConfigs(project, region, instanceGroupManager, orderBy=None, maxResults=None, pageToken=None, filter=None)</code>
  <pre>Lists all of the per-instance configs defined for the managed instance group.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request, should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  orderBy: string, Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
  maxResults: integer, The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
  pageToken: string, Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
  filter: string, A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Returns:
  An object of the form:

    {
    "nextPageToken": "A String", # [Output Only] This token allows you to get the next page of results for list requests. If the number of results is larger than maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

<div class="method">
    <code class="details" id="resize">resize(project, region, instanceGroupManager, size, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Changes the intended size of the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more instances.

The resize operation is marked DONE if the resize request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the creating or deleting actions with the listmanagedinstances method.

If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, Name of the managed instance group. (required)
  size: integer, Number of instances that should exist in this instance group manager. (required)
  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

    <code class="details" id="updatePerInstanceConfigs">updatePerInstanceConfigs(project, region, instanceGroupManager, body, requestId=None)</code>
  <pre>Insert or update (for the ones that already exist) per-instance configs for the managed instance group. perInstanceConfig.instance serves as a key used to distinguish whether to perform insert or patch.

Args:
  project: string, Project ID for this request. (required)
  region: string, Name of the region scoping this request, should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  instanceGroupManager: string, The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # RegionInstanceGroupManagers.updatePerInstanceConfigs
    "perInstanceConfigs": [ # The list of per-instance configs to insert or patch on this managed instance group.
      {
        "override": { # Overrides of stateful properties for a given instance
          "origin": "A String", # [Output Only] Indicates where does the override come from.
          "disks": [ # Disk overrides defined for this instance. According to documentation the maximum number of disks attached to an instance is 128: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/ However, compute API defines the limit at 140, so this is what we check.
            {
              "deviceName": "A String", # The name of the device on the VM
              "mode": "A String", # The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in READ_WRITE mode.
              "source": "A String", # The disk that is/will be mounted
            },
          ],
          "metadata": [ # Metadata overrides defined for this instance. TODO(b/69785416) validate the total length is <9 KB
            {
              "value": "A String", # Value for the metadata entry. These are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed on values is that their size must be less than or equal to 262144 bytes (256 KiB).
              "key": "A String", # Key for the metadata entry. Keys must conform to the following regexp: [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+, and be less than 128 bytes in length. This is reflected as part of a URL in the metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not conflict with any other metadata keys for the project.
            },
          ],
        },
        "instance": "A String", # The URL of the instance. Serves as a merge key during UpdatePerInstanceConfigs operation, i.e. if per-instance config with the same instance URL exists then it will be updated, otherwise a new one will be created.
        "name": "A String", # The name of the per-instance config and the corresponding instance. Serves as a merge key during UpdatePerInstanceConfigs operation, i.e. if per-instance config with the same name exists then it will be updated, otherwise a new one will be created for the VM instance with the same name. An attempt to create a per-instance config for a VM instance that either doesn't exist or is not part of the group will result in a failure.
        "preservedState": { # Preserved state for a given instance. # Intended preserved state for the given instance. Does not contain state generated based on Stateful Policy.
          "disks": { # Preserved disks defined for this instance. This map is keyed with the device names of the disks.
            "a_key": {
              "source": "A String", # The URL of the disk resource that is stateful and should be attached to the VM instance.
              "mode": "A String", # The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in READ_WRITE mode.
              "autoDelete": "A String", # These stateful disks will never be deleted during autohealing, update, instance recreate operations. This flag is used to configure if the disk should be deleted after it is no longer used by the group, e.g. when the given instance or the whole MIG is deleted. Note: disks attached in READ_ONLY mode cannot be auto-deleted.
            },
          },
          "metadata": { # Preserved metadata defined for this instance.
            "a_key": "A String",
          },
        },
        "fingerprint": "A String", # Fingerprint of this per-instance config. This field may be used in optimistic locking. It will be ignored when inserting a per-instance config. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update an existing per-instance config or the field needs to be unset.
      },
    ],
  }

  requestId: string, An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
