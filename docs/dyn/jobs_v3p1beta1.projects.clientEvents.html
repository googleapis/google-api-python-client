Args:
  parent: string, Parent project name. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The report event request.
  &quot;clientEvent&quot;: { # An event issued when an end user interacts with the application that implements Cloud Talent Solution. Providing this information improves the quality of search and recommendation for the API clients, enabling the service to perform optimally. The number of events sent must be consistent with other calls, such as job searches, issued to the service by the client. # Required. Events issued when end user interacts with customer&#x27;s application that uses Cloud Talent Solution.
    &quot;createTime&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The timestamp of the event.
    &quot;eventId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique identifier, generated by the client application. This `event_id` is used to establish the relationship between different events (see parent_event_id).
    &quot;extraInfo&quot;: { # Optional. Extra information about this event. Used for storing information with no matching field in event payload, for example, user application specific context or details. At most 20 keys are supported. The maximum total size of all keys and values is 2 KB.
      &quot;a_key&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;,
    },
    &quot;jobEvent&quot;: { # An event issued when a job seeker interacts with the application that implements Cloud Talent Solution. # A event issued when a job seeker interacts with the application that implements Cloud Talent Solution.
      &quot;jobs&quot;: [ # Required. The job name(s) associated with this event. For example, if this is an impression event, this field contains the identifiers of all jobs shown to the job seeker. If this was a view event, this field contains the identifier of the viewed job.
        &quot;A String&quot;,
      ],
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. The type of the event (see JobEventType).
    },
    &quot;parentEventId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Optional. The event_id of an event that resulted in the current event. For example, a Job view event usually follows a parent impression event: A job seeker first does a search where a list of jobs appears (impression). The job seeker then selects a result and views the description of a particular job (Job view).
    &quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Required. A unique ID generated in the API responses. It can be found in ResponseMetadata.request_id.
  },
}

  x__xgafv: string, V1 error format.
    Allowed values
      1 - v1 error format
      2 - v2 error format
