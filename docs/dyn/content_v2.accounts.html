  <pre>Updates a Merchant Center account. Any fields that are not provided are deleted from the resource.

Args:
  merchantId: string, The ID of the managing account. If this parameter is not the same as accountId, then this account must be a multi-client account and `accountId` must be the ID of a sub-account of this account. (required)
  accountId: string, The ID of the account. (required)
  body: object, The request body.
    The object takes the form of:

{ # Account data. After the creation of a new account it may take a few minutes before it is fully operational. The methods delete, insert, and update require the admin role.
  &quot;adultContent&quot;: True or False, # Indicates whether the merchant sells adult content.
  &quot;adwordsLinks&quot;: [ # List of linked AdWords accounts that are active or pending approval. To create a new link request, add a new link with status `active` to the list. It will remain in a `pending` state until approved or rejected either in the AdWords interface or through the AdWords API. To delete an active link, or to cancel a link request, remove it from the list.
    {
      &quot;adwordsId&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Customer ID of the AdWords account.
      &quot;status&quot;: &quot;A String&quot;, # Status of the link between this Merchant Center account and the AdWords account. Upon retrieval, it represents the actual status of the link and can be either `active` if it was approved in Google AdWords or `pending` if it&#x27;s pending approval. Upon insertion, it represents the *intended* status of the link. Re-uploading a link with status `active` when it&#x27;s still pending or with status `pending` when it&#x27;s already active will have no effect: the status will remain unchanged. Re-uploading a link with deprecated status `inactive` is equivalent to not submitting the link at all and will delete the link if it was active or cancel the link request if it was pending. Acceptable values are: - &quot;`active`&quot; - &quot;`pending`&quot;
