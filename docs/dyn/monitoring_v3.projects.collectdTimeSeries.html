Args:
  name: string, The project in which to create the time series. The format is "projects/PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER". (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # The CreateCollectdTimeSeries request.
    "collectdPayloads": [ # The collectd payloads representing the time series data. You must not include more than a single point for each time series, so no two payloads can have the same values for all of the fields plugin, plugin_instance, type, and type_instance.

It optionally contains a histogram representing the distribution of those values across a set of buckets.The summary statistics are the count, mean, sum of the squared deviation from the mean, the minimum, and the maximum of the set of population of values. The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing widths.Although it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include non-finite values (infinities or NaNs) in the population of values, as this will render the mean and sum_of_squared_deviation fields meaningless. # A distribution value.
