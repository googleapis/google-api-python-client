    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the different capabilities of the Google Drive Python API. Note that the reader is encouraged to first check if [PyDrive](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/) can do the job. PyDrive is mainly used for simple requests, such as creating folders and files. However, in the case that a more complex task is required, then the Google Drive Python API is more appropriate. This guide may be complemented with the official [documentation](http://googleapis.github.io/google-api-python-client/docs/dyn/drive_v3.html).\n",
